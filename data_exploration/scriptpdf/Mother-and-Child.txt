INT. KAREN’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

1

1973: KAREN, AGE 14, is kissing and groping with a BOY OF
15, TOM. It’s heated and clumsy. At one point they break
apart and Karen looks at the boy’s face, completely
infatuated. She takes off her shirt and they kiss again.

INT. PREGNANT GIRLS’ HOME - DAY

2

1973: Karen and other pregnant teenagers sit around a
room knitting or listening to one of them read a book out
loud.
3

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT

3

1973: KAREN during labor, screaming.

Then, a silent image: a new born BABY GIRL in a hospital
bassinet, crying at the top of her lungs. We see her from
an angle where the baby's face can hardly be made out,
adults crossing back and forth in front of her. Finally
the bassinet is rolled away.
Fade to black and to a title:

EXT. DAY/NIGHT

4

Views of residential streets in the San Fernando valley,
mostly without pedestrians. Front and back yards. A
swing. Old flower pots. An empty birdcage. Days into
dusks into nights. We hear music over these images: a
child’s piano lesson.
5

INT. KAREN'S ROOM - NIGHT

5

Close on KAREN -- NOW AGE 50 -- while she sleeps. There
is perspiration on her brow and she stirs and mumbles, in
the grip of a nightmare. She wakes up suddenly, scared
and disoriented.
6

INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Karen's mother NORA, a woman in her eighties, is asleep
on the bed, facing the wall. Karen comes into the room,
gets into bed with her and closes her eyes.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Karen is eating breakfast across from Nora. They eat in
silence. Then:
KAREN
Her birthday is coming up. She'll be
thirty-seven.
Nora says nothing.

INT. LAW OFFICES - DAY
A woman in her late thirties, ELIZABETH, is being
interviewed by PAUL, an African-American man in his midfifties, a senior partner in the law firm. Through glass
walls we see the very busy office.
PAUL
I spoke to Bill Colden and he said you
were one of the best attorneys he's ever
worked with. And I know Bill; praise
doesn't come easy to him.
ELIZABETH
We had a good relationship. He runs that
firm well.
PAUL
Yes, he does. Tell me about what you
consider your professional strengths.
ELIZABETH
I don't believe in improvisation. I
prepare my cases rigorously. I'm on top
of clients and I handle them well. I
protect them from themselves. I prefer
to work by myself on a project but I can
work well in a team if necessary. I work
equally well with men or with women but
I prefer to report to a man.
Why is that?

PAUL
ELIZABETH
Many women find me threatening. That
makes for a difficult working
relationship with a woman supervisor.
Would I be reporting to you?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

Yes.

PAUL
ELIZABETH
So we would have nothing to worry about.
A beat.
PAUL
Why do you think women find you
threatening?
ELIZABETH
I'm not in the sisterhood. I am my own
person.
PAUL
Do you believe most women are not their
own person?
ELIZABETH
Yes. Neither are men, for that matter.
Everyone is so eager to please.
Paul returns to the papers in front of him.
PAUL
I've noticed that you've moved to and
from this area several times.
ELIZABETH
I've gone wherever I've had to go to get
ahead.
PAUL
But you always return.
ELIZABETH
This part of the world is as good as
any.
A beat.
PAUL
Well, Elizabeth, your resume is
exceptional. It's no secret that you
would be an asset to us.
ELIZABETH
I would not disappoint you.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

4.

PAUL
Tell me a little about your personal
background.
Elizabeth thinks about it for a moment.
ELIZABETH
I was born here, in Los Angeles, and I
was given up for adoption on the day of
my birth. My mother was fourteen when I
was born. That is all I know about her.
My adoptive father died when I was ten.
My adoptive mother and I are not close.
My name, Elizabeth Joyce, is a name that
I picked out for myself in junior high
school. It's my legal name now; I don't
go by any other. I live alone; I have
since I turned seventeen. I've never
been married and have no plans to marry.
I value my independence above all
things. That way I don't have
expectations to fulfill. Other than my
own, which are great enough.
A beat.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
That's all she wrote.
9

INT. ADOPTION AGENCY - DAY
An African-American couple in their thirties, LUCY and
JOSEPH sit across from a nun in her fifties, SISTER
JOANNE.
LUCY
We've been married for four years. We
tried from the beginning but we haven't
been able to. And we kept hoping, you
know, against hope, like they say. But
it's just not going to be. We know that
now. We're resigned to it. We're not
bitter, I don't think. Do you think
we're bitter about it?
Joseph shakes no.
LUCY (CONT'D)
We're not. We could make good parents.
Joseph is a very tender man. He's
affectionate.

LUCY (CONT'D)
We could learn to love a baby in a
minute, even if it wasn't ours. Would we
be able to name the baby ourselves?
SISTER JOANNE
It depends on the circumstances.
Sometimes the biological parents and the
adoptive parents agree on a name.
LUCY
We would agree to agree.
Lucy laughs by herself. Then seriously:
LUCY (CONT'D)
We're ready now. To adopt. Blood is
important, I think, but it's the time
spent together that really matters.
Isn't that right?
Joseph nods yes. A beat.
LUCY (CONT'D)
We're good people.
10

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Lucy and Joseph walk to the car.
Oh, my god.
What?

LUCY
JOSEPH

LUCY
Why didn't you shut me up?
JOSEPH
It's all right. Everyone who comes to
her office is nervous.
LUCY
That whole speech about time spent
together... where the hell did I get
that? Jesus. Why didn't you open your
mouth?
JOSEPH
She liked you.
You think?

LUCY

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

They sit in the car. She’s the driver.
Yes. Relax.

JOSEPH

Lucy thinks about that, then reaches over, puts her hand
on Joseph's crotch and caresses it.
LUCY
How does that feel?
JOSEPH
It feels okay.
LUCY
Just okay, babe?
It's good.

JOSEPH
She smiles at him, happy that he's happy. She speaks
almost to herself.
LUCY
Please, God, let us find a baby.
11

INT. THERAPY POOL - DAY

11

An indoor swimming pool used for hydrotherapy and water
aerobics. Most of the patients are elderly and frail.
Karen is one of the therapists and she’s in the pool,
receiving and elderly patient that two other therapists
help into the water. Karen sees a LATINO MAN of about 50,
PACO, being introduced to other therapists like he's new
on the job.
He notices Karen and the patient and smiles. Karen looks
at him blankly, then looks away. Then, to the old woman:
KAREN
Is that man flirting with you?
The old woman smiles and continues with her exercises.
Karen steals another look at Paco.
12

INT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Karen comes into the house. Her mother is alone in the
living room, asleep in a rocking chair.
Mexican music plays in the next room.

INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
Karen walks into the kitchen. SOFIA, a Hispanic woman in
her late thirties, is ironing clothes while her seven
year old daughter, CRISTI, is undressing a doll.
Hi.

KAREN
SOFIA
Hello. Say hello to Karen, mija.
Hi, Karen.

CRISTI
Karen smiles a stiff little smile without looking at the
girl. Sofia begins to put away the ironing board.
SOFIA
Your mother had a good day. She ate
really well.
KAREN
How long has she been asleep?
SOFIA
For about half an hour. She needed it. I
can change her into the night gown
before I go.
KAREN
I'll do that.
SOFIA
I'm going to come in a little late
tomorrow.
She grabs her sweater and handbag and an ipod and little
speakers that she’s set up on the kitchen counter.
Okay.

KAREN
SOFIA
It's back to school day for this one.
Karen hasn't so much as turned in the direction of the
little girl. Sofia and the girl exit the kitchen.

13

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

From where she stands Karen can see Sofia and her
daughter preparing to go out the front door. Before
leaving Sofia caresses Nora's forehead. The old woman is
still asleep.
14

INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

14

Karen is tucking her mother into bed. The woman lies on
her side and cuddles up in the fetal position, like a
child, but remains with her eyes open. Karen checks her
mother's fingernails for length.
KAREN
These need clipping.
Nora pulls away her hand softly.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I'm going to look for a new person for
you. Sofia never asked if I minded that
she brought the girl over while school
was out. I don't know what I would have
said but she should of asked.
Nora talks without looking at Karen:
NORA
You cannot fire her.
After a beat the old woman closes her eyes.
15

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
Elizabeth sits on the sofa reading a novel. The doorbell
rings. She ignores it, reads on. It rings again. She gets
up, walks to the door and looks through the peep hole.
It's a PREGNANT WOMAN, flower pot in hand, with a man in
his thirties. Elizabeth opens the door. They are TRACY
and STEVEN.
TRACY
Hi. We're Tracy and Steven. We're next
door. We just wanted to say hello and
welcome you to the building.

15

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

9.

She offers the potted plant and Elizabeth takes it
without so much as a good look at it.
Thank you.

ELIZABETH
TRACY
We only moved in two months ago, so we
know what it's like not to know anyone
around here. It feels like a pretty safe
building, though. Don't you think? We
think so.
While Tracy speaks Elizabeth looks back and forth between
Steven and her.
ELIZABETH
Yes. It's quiet.
TRACY
You're here all by yourself, right?
ELIZABETH
That's right.
TRACY
Yes. I told Steven I thought you were.
Didn't I?
Yes.

STEVEN
TRACY
It's mostly single people in the
building. No children. So far.
A beat. Tracy looks quickly beyond Elizabeth to the
interior of the apartment.
ELIZABETH
Sorry, I'm just in the middle of
something.
TRACY
Oh, don't worry. We'll talk again. I'm
home most of the day. Come by for a cup
of sugar.
STEVEN
Nice meeting you.
Elizabeth shuts the door as they walk away.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

16

Joseph is on top of Lucy as they make love. The phone
rings.
LUCY
That's my mother.
They practically freeze as Lucy strains to hear her
mother's voice on the answering machine.
ADA (V.O.)
Lucy. Are you there? Lucy? Lu? Are you
there or aren't you? (a beat) Lucy?
Lucy? (She whistles) Okay. You're not
there. (She whistles again, then
silence). Lucy?
LUCY
Jesus. Why does she do that?
ADA (V.O.)
Call me, okay? I'll try you back in a
little while. Hello? Hel-lo-o? I don't
know if this is still recording or if I
got cut off. Is it still recording?
Okay. Bye. Call me.(a beat) Lucy?
She hangs up. They slowly start up again. Lucy tries to
get into it but soon gives up.
LUCY
I can't. I lost it.
JOSEPH
Come on, Lucy.
LUCY
I'm sorry. You go ahead, you come, baby.
Go ahead, I'll watch you.
He starts up again. Lucy kisses Joseph's forehead, chin,
nose and eyes gently, observing him. She hums a melody
for him.

INT. THERAPISTS' COMMON AREA - DAY
Karen is writing in her notebook, hunched over it like a
schoolgirl taking an exam.
KAREN (V.O.)
I had a new dream a couple of days ago.
I come home and try to get in but my key
breaks inside the lock. I look through
the window and I can see you in my bed,
sleeping. I go in through the back door
and I walk up to you and smell your
breath. It smells of another woman's
breast milk -- not mine. And the bed is
wet. You’ve wet the bed and I start to
cry because I don't have clean sheets to
make it fresh.
The new guy, PACO, walks into the room and smiles at her
while he pours himself a cup of coffee. Karen just closes
her notebook and looks away. Paco walks over to the
table.
PACO
I didn't mean to stare. Paco.
He offers his hand and then they shake.
PACO (CONT'D)
Karen, right?
Karen says nothing.
PACO (CONT’D)
Clara told me your name.
KAREN
Clara. What else did she say about me?
PACO
Nothing else.
KAREN
She always has time on her hands to be
talking to someone. That's why her work
stinks.
Karen sees that another physiotherapist has come in for
coffee and she returns to her writing. Paco walks away.

INT. LUCY’S BAKERY - MORNING
A bakery owned and managed by Lucy. It’s pretty busy.
Lucy is putting the final touches on a cake while her
mother, ADA, hovers.
ADA
Was this your idea or his?
LUCY
Please don't start. I need for you to be
with me on this.
ADA
I am with you. I'm just wondering whose
idea it was.
LUCY
It's my idea.
An employee walks between them. A beat.
ADA
That mother-in-law of yours is going to
blow a gasket. Her prince raising the
child of a stranger.
Ada chuckles. Lucy doesn't think it's amusing. She starts
to put the cake in a box.
LUCY
And what about you? Are you going to
love this baby or not?
ADA
Well, there's no baby to speak of yet.
What's the next step?
LUCY
We're meeting a woman on Monday. She's
six months pregnant.
ADA
And she just now decided to give up the
baby?
LUCY
No. Apparently she's already turned down
several couples.

19

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

13.

ADA
Turned down? Who's approving who?
There's an argument that you'd be doing
her a favor.
LUCY
Nobody is doing anybody a favor, mom.
Everyone stands to win.
A beat. Ada is not so convinced.
ADA
There's so much positioning with
everything nowadays. Motherhood should
be a much simpler thing than this.
Lucy can't believe what she has just heard. She fights
back her rage and tears.
ADA (CONT'D)
Oh, Lucy -- I'm sorry. That was a
horrible thing to say. I'm sorry, Lu.
I'm an idiot. Forgive me, please. I'm
sorry.
She means it.
LUCY
You really wear me out, mom. I love you - but between my daughter and I things
will be different. I've promised myself
that already.
Ada is hurt.
ADA
Thank you for that, Lucy.
20

INT. ELIZABETH'S OFFICE - DAY
Elizabeth is arranging things in her new office. She is
unaware that Paul observes from the open door.
PAUL
We've given you one of our best offices.
She turns and sees him.
ELIZABETH
And what have I done to deserve it?

20

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

14.

PAUL
Nothing yet, but we have high hopes for
you.
ELIZABETH
As well you should.
A beat.
PAUL
Any questions, concerns?
No.

ELIZABETH
PAUL
Dinner tomorrow to welcome you aboard.
Eight fifteen at La Provencal. Do you
know it?
Yes.

ELIZABETH
PAUL
I'll see you there.
He leaves.
21

INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Karen is brushing Nora's hair and tying it back in a bun.
She brushes it back hard and tight.
How’s work?

NORA

Karen is surprised, like Nora seldom asks.
KAREN
It’s good. There's a new training
program, to work with people who are
recuperating from chemotherapy. They
asked if any of us were interested and I
said yes. They'll pay us to learn so
that's good, isn't it?
Karen nods. A beat.
KAREN (CONT’D)
There's a new therapist. This man my
age.

21

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

Nora waits for more.
KAREN (CONT'D)
He's a little...(she searches for the
right term) ... heavy set. And he’s
graying, you know.
Karen shows the area on her own head.
KAREN (CONT'D)
He's friendly. Everybody likes him.

14A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

NORA
Watch yourself, Karen. Don't set
yourself up for falls.
Karen tries not to show her disappointment.
22

INT. THERAPY POOL - DAY

22

Karen works on stretches with a patient while a young
assistant therapist looks on.
She sees Paco walking towards her.
KAREN
(to the assistant therapist)
Here comes Valentino.
She makes the assistant smile. Karen hands the patient
over and turns to write in the patient’s file. Paco walks
up.
PACO
Hey. I feel like we got off on the wrong
foot.
KAREN
Why do you say that?
PACO
You were upset when...
KAREN
You don't know me well enough to know if
I was upset.
Paco doesn't know what to add. Karen is looking straight
at him but says nothing else. Paco walks away. After a
moment she says to herself:
KAREN (CONT'D)
Karen. Stupid idiot.
23

EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY
An African-American woman in her early forties, LETICIA,
walks the hallway, apparently looking for someone.
A conference room opens and a class lets out. Among the
students is a YOUNG WOMAN. She is six months pregnant and
she is Letitia’s daughter, RAY. When Ray sees Leticia she
changes direction to avoid her. Leticia follows anyway.

23

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

16.

LETICIA
Ray! Ray, honey.
Leticia catches up and walks along Ray, who keeps walking
like she’s alone.
LETICIA (CONT’D)
Can we talk? How are you, honey? Are you
well? You look good.
RAY
You have booze on your breath.
LETICIA
I do not. I don’t.
You reek.

RAY

LETICIA
Don’t say that. I haven’t had a drink in
four months. One hundred and eleven
days.
RAY
You’re a lying sack of shit.
Leticia slows down, letting Ray get away. Leticia turns
and walks away. Ray takes a look over her shoulder, sees
Leticia walking away and stops. After a beat she goes
after her.
RAY (CONT’D)
Hey! Mom, wait!
Ray catches up to Leticia.
RAY (CONT’D)
Wait up. Let’s talk.
Fuck you.

LETICIA

Ray lags behind.
24

EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
Karen walks out of the building and walks towards her
car. She sees Paco backing out of his spot and driving
towards her. Karen waits as he drives by. He sees her,
stops and rolls down his window.

24

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

17.

KAREN
I have some time before I have to be
home. I'm getting a cup of coffee.
Paco just looks at her: it's not much of an invitation.
PACO
Mind if I join you?
She nods then turns towards her car. He laughs.
25

INT. DINER - AFTERNOON
Karen and Paco sit in a booth. A WAITRESS takes their
order.
KAREN
Coffee, black, please.
PACO
Same here. And I'll have the apple pie.
The waitress leaves.
PACO (CONT'D)
I can't seem to stay away from apple
pie.
KAREN
You should watch your weight.
She regrets it the moment she says it. Paco takes it well
and just laughs.
PACO
Yes, I should. How long have you been at
the clinic?
KAREN
Six years and six months. April 11, 2003
was my first day.
PACO
You have a good memory.
KAREN
Yes. I was at Westside Memorial for
eleven years before that.
PACO
That's a good place.

25

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

17A.

KAREN
I didn't see eye to eye with my
supervisor. She was sloppy and she
needed me to pick up the slack for her.
I grew tired of it and I told her so.
She had me fired.
The waiter comes by to pour the coffee. Karen touches her
cup.
KAREN (CONT'D)
This is cold.
She picks up the cup and saucer and gives it back to the
waitress who takes it away. Paco is okay with his coffee.
KAREN (CONT'D)
What about you?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

PACO
I've been here for five months -- from
the Bay Area. I've been a therapist for
four years. Before that I drove for a
car company. I'm divorced. I'm already a
grandfather -- can you believe it? My
daughter Melissa is twenty-eight. She
has twins. Not exactly planned but what
can you do. She's happy. She’s still
living up there.
Karen says nothing.
PACO (CONT'D)
What else do you want to know?
KAREN
We don't have to interrogate each other.
This is not a date.
PACO
Interrogate. That's a harsh word.
Paco drinks his coffee.
PACO (CONT'D)
Do you live by yourself?
No.

KAREN
She adds nothing else. Paco chuckles.
KAREN (CONT'D)
What's so funny?
PACO
Nothing. I just can't seem to say the
right thing around you. And I'm trying,
believe me.
KAREN
What do you mean?
PACO
I feel like I'm always putting my foot
in my mouth and I don't know why.
A beat. She doesn't take her eyes off him.
PACO (CONT'D)
Listen, I'm sorry. Forget I said that. I
don't know what I'm talking about.

18.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

KAREN
I am not a difficult person.
PACO
Oh, I didn't mean that.
KAREN
You're not comfortable with me.
No, I am.

PACO
KAREN
My words are too harsh for you.
No, no. I...

PACO
Paco is silenced by the waitress, who returns with an
empty cup for Karen. As she is pouring the coffee Karen
gets up and leaves.

INT. JOSEPH'S PARENTS HOUSE - DUSK
Lucy and Joseph are at dinner with Joseph's parents,
CAROL and WINSTON.
WINSTON
Do you know what you want?
LUCY
I don't care.
JOSEPH
A boy, I guess.
WINSTON
Biological parents get to visit their
children and to have a hand in their
upbringing. Isn't that the case now?
LUCY
No. It's your child and you call the
shots. It's just without that whole
secrecy. If a child wants to now where
they come from they have the right to
know.
CAROL
I hope it's all for the better. I hope
they don't change their mind about all
these new rules twenty years from now.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Elizabeth follows a maitre d’ through the restaurant.
They reach a table for two where Paul gets up to greet
her.
Elizabeth.

PAUL
The maitre d’ has pulled back the chair but Elizabeth
remains standing.
ELIZABETH
I didn't realize it was just the two of
us.
PAUL
My partners can put anyone to sleep in a
minute. I thought this would be better.
ELIZABETH
It's not what I expected.
A beat.
PAUL
I hope you don't think it's
inappropriate.
ELIZABETH
I like to know what everything means,
that's all.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

21.

Clearly she's not sitting without an explanation.
PAUL
Just a man getting acquainted with his
new employee.
Elizabeth thinks about it, then sits; Paul follows.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Something to drink?
ELIZABETH
Sparkling water.
The hostess leaves.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Are you married?
PAUL
I was. My wife died five years ago.
A beat.
ELIZABETH
What was her name?
Maureen.

PAUL
ELIZABETH
What about her do you miss the most?
The question takes him by surprise. He thinks about it.
PAUL
We were close. That's not easy to come
by. That's what I miss.
A beat.
PAUL (CONT'D)
My kids say their mother and I were
closer to each other than we were to
them. I was hoping they hadn’t noticed.
It’s a joke and it makes her smile.
ELIZABETH
How old are they?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

22.

PAUL
Maria is twenty-nine and Julian is
thirty.
ELIZABETH
You started young.
PAUL
Not that young.
ELIZABETH
So you’re no spring chicken.
He laughs.
No, I’m not.

PAUL

ELIZABETH
Most men don't get out of adolescence
till their fifties.
PAUL
I'm still working on it. Age is no big
deal; if you stay clear of regrets.
ELIZABETH
Ah. There's the rub.
A beat.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
You're still handsome.
He bows with his head in mock solemnity.
Thank you.

PAUL
Elizabeth reads her menu.

INT. LUCY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Joseph reads while Lucy lies with her back to him, lost
in thought. Finally:
LUCY
No one can make me feel like shit like
your mom. Not even my own mom -- believe
it or not.
Joseph waits for more.

27

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

23.

LUCY (CONT'D)
She's an expert at it. She can zero in -like those smart bombs that can find a
needle in a hay stack. And it's all in a
frequency that only I can hear -- like a
dog whistle. Everyone else has no idea
what's going on.
JOSEPH
What did she say?
LUCY
She said having a baby was the only
thing you've ever wanted.
JOSEPH
I don't think she meant anything by it.
LUCY
Well, there's the thing: you married a
barren girl.
Joseph puts the book down and moves in to cuddle up to
her.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Don't touch me right now. Don't. I'm not
mad at you -- just -- leave me alone for
a while. I mean it.
He goes back to his side.
LUCY (CONT'D)
We can have sex later, if you want.

Karen's mother is in bed, awake. She's pale and tired.
Karen sits in a chair nearby.
KAREN
That young doctor said he'd come back

A beat.
NORA
I don't want to die here.
KAREN
You're not going to die.
Nora just looks at Karen.
KAREN (CONT'D)
You're not going to die. You’re going to
be fine.
NORA
Do you expect me to live forever?
KAREN
Don’t start with that.
NORA
Even if I could I wouldn't want to. It's
one disappointment after another.
A beat.
Nora looks at Karen intently and for a long moment it
looks like she’s about to say something but she stops
herself.
KAREN
What? What, mom?
Nora says nothing.
What?

KAREN (CONT’D)

Then Nora turns away, tears running down her face. Karen
looks at her, perplexed. She reaches out to touch her
mother’s hand, but Nora pulls the arm away slowly.

A telenovela plays on the TV. Sofia sits near the bed

Say goodbye to Nora.
Bye.

CRISTI

She holds Cristi over the bed and Nora kisses the girl on
the forehead. Karen is surprised by this gesture. Sofia
takes one last look at Nora. Then:
SOFIA
Goodbye, Nora.
Sofia and Cristi leave and Karen and her mom return to
their silence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
As Elizabeth and Paul walk out of the elevator on her
floor they run into Steven and Tracy on their way out.
Steven carries a pillow under his arm.
TRACY
Hi! We were just talking about you.
Weren't we, Steve? Because I'm getting
up to use the bathroom seven times a
night and our rooms are back to back. I
hope I'm not waking you.
ELIZABETH
I haven't heard anything.
TRACY
Oh, good, good. You'd let us know,
wouldn't you?
Yes.

ELIZABETH
A beat. Tracy smiles at Paul. Paul offers his hand.
I'm Paul.

PAUL
ELIZABETH
This is Steven and -- tell me your name
again.
Tracy.

TRACY
ELIZABETH
This is Paul. My father.
The couple are a little surprised that an AfricanAmerican man is her father but they go with the flow.

TRACY
Oh! Nice to meet you, sir.
Hi.

STEVEN
Paul too is surprised and he laughs at the joke but no
one says anything else and the moment passes.
Hello.

PAUL
ELIZABETH
(about the pillow)
Are you spending the night in the
garage?
Tracy laughs.
TRACY
No. It's for our birthing class. It
starts tonight. He's my coach.
ELIZABETH
We'll get out of your way then.
Elizabeth walks through between them. Paul follows.
Good night.
Bye-bye.

PAUL
TRACY

ELIZABETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Elizabeth is opening a bottle of wine.
PAUL
What was that about, out there?
ELIZABETH
She was almost pleased you were black,
did you notice? It was a chance for her
to exercise her liberal good will. Now
she'll be doing the math all night.
(imitates Tracy's tone) "Maybe the
father's only half-black and the mother
is white".
PAUL
They seem friendly enough.

ELIZABETH
It's impossible to know what they are.
They don't know it themselves. They're
too busy re-inventing themselves to
everyone's liking.
She hands him a glass of wine.
Cheers.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
They toast and drink. A beat.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
What are you thinking about?

My wife.
Maureen.

PAUL

He empties the glass. She takes the glass and kisses him.
36

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Elizabeth undresses Paul. He tries to undress her, touch
her and kiss her but she won't let him.
She lays him back on the bed. She is still dressed. She
removes her own underwear and mounts him. She begins to
rock back and forth and he follows.
ELIZABETH
No. Stay still.
She continues to rock slowly on top of him.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Don't move, old man.
He's very still. She's doing all the work for herself,
rubbing against him.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
That feels good.
She goes on. She hasn't stopped looking into his eyes.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Don't move. I can come like this.
She keeps going in silence. Her movements are small.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Let me come first.
She finishes, intensely but quietly and without ever
looking away from his eyes.
Now you.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
She watches him finish. He holds her gaze as long as he
can but at the end closes his eyes. She smiles watching
him, then cuddles up to him.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Good boy, Paul.

already dead, her eyes and mouth slightly open.
39

INT. ELIZABETH’S BALCONY - DAWN
Elizabeth is in her bathrobe, taking in the morning air.
She can see Paul still asleep in her bed. She turns to
the next balcony to find Steven walking out, already
showered and dressed. He lights a cigarette.
She observes him for a moment, unseen. Finally he sees
her and nods hello. Elizabeth positions herself to face
him. She opens her bathrobe and bares her breasts for him
to see. She holds for a good while, then finally walks
back into her apartment.

SISTER JOANNE
Be yourselves. You have many things
going for you. She wants a young couple.
She wants a woman with a job or career -Lucy you have the bakery -- she'll like
that. Questions?
Lucy looks at Joseph. No questions. Sister Joanne pats
Lucy on the leg and leaves the room. Lucy and Joseph
wait. Finally:
LUCY
I love you, Joseph.
He smiles and reaches for her hand. The door open and
Sister Joanne returns with RAY. Lucy and Joseph stand.
SISTER JOANNE
This is Ray. Lucy and Joseph.
Everyone nods.
SISTER JOANNE (CONT'D)
I'll leave you to talk.
LUCY
How long do we have?
RAY
As long as we need.
Sister Joanne leaves. Ray sits and Lucy and Joseph
follow. Ray looks them over unabashed, at ease in the
silence. Finally:
RAY (CONT'D)
I've already turned down several couples
-- did she tell you that?
Lucy nods.
JOSEPH
What kind of people are you looking for?

40

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

RAY
(regarding Lucy)
I want to hear from her first before I
talk to you.
Lucy is intimidated and says nothing.
RAY (CONT'D)
You must have something you want to say.
Most people have a speech prepared of
some kind.
Lucy shakes no.
RAY (CONT'D)
Come on. What did you expect from this
meeting?
LUCY
I didn't expect to feel like I was
dragged into the principal's office.
That's how I feel right now.
Ray laughs.
RAY
Okay. Good answer. I'll ask you some
questions. Do you believe in God?
LUCY
I was raised Catholic.
RAY
Do you believe in God?
LUCY
I'm not a very religious person. Joseph
is -- (to Joseph) aren't you?
He nods yes.
RAY
You don't believe that a higher being
created you and loves you and looks
after you and steers the ship?

No. I'm sorry.
RAY

LUCY
RAY
Why the hell not? What is the purpose of
meeting here today, then?
Lucy says nothing. Ray laughs, annoyed.
RAY (CONT'D)
Well -- look. Let's not play games. You
either want to tell me who you are or
you don't. If you don't I'd rather part
ways -- better sooner than later.
She gets up.
No -- wait.

LUCY
Ray waits, standing. Lucy collects her thoughts.
LUCY (CONT'D)
I believe -- that we come from nothing
and when we die we return to nothing.
What we make of our lives is our will
and our luck. The strength of our
character and the -- the roll of the
die.
Ray just looks at her. Then:
RAY
And this is what you would teach a
child? This is what you want him to
believe?
Lucy nods.
RAY (CONT'D)
This is what you would teach my baby.

Joseph tries to put his arm around her. She reacts
violently.

She's gone now. She will never see your
face and you will never see hers. There
will always be a silence between you.
Intercut with Karen placing the urn containing her
mother's ashes on the floor inside a closet. After
placing the urn she stands there and looks at it.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I don’t want that for us. For you and
me.
Karen kneels down again, opens the urn and looks at the
ashes. She smells them.

Karen is behind the wheel of her car, stopped at a red
light. A WOMAN in her thirties crossing in front of her
catches her eye. Karen then follows with her gaze ANOTHER
WOMAN crossing in the opposite direction. Then a THIRD
WOMAN, this one seven months pregnant.
After the women pass Karen is left deep in thought, until
a honking car behind her awakes her and she drives off.

I was in this branch about three years
ago and I saw you. I ran out of here

She chuckles, trying to make light of it. He takes her
in.
KAREN (CONT’D)
My mother died.
Tom nods but says nothing.

How are you? You married that girl from
NoHo High, right? Hailie.

KAREN
Do you have kids?

EXT. BANK - AFTERNOON

Karen and Tom sit at a bench outside the bank.
TOM
I never told you: my dad gave me the
beating of my life. Not when he found
out you were pregnant. He didn’t say
anything for months then. But when he
heard the baby was born -- boy!
Oh, Tom.

KAREN

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

38.

TOM
It doesn’t matter. I was happy he did
that. I got him out of my system forever
after that. Fuck him.
A beat.
KAREN
And your mom? I liked her.
TOM
Her memory’s gone. She was married for
sixty years and had four kids and worked
a dozen jobs and fought with my dad
every day and was even happy sometimes,
but mostly she was tired as hell. Now
she looks at me when I visit and she
doesn’t know who I am -- or my sisters.
Something in my face rings a bell for
her -- but she can’t make it out.
There’s nothing left.
Tom is trying to make light of it but clearly it’s a
painful subject for him.
TOM (cont’d) (CONT’D)
She wanted to look for her, you know.
She said to my sisters once: “It’s
abnormal -- my grandchild out there in
the world, and I’ve never met her.”
They look at each other. Tom caresses Karen’s arm.
48

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Paul and Elizabeth are in bed. Elizabeth curls up to Paul
and caresses his face affectionately.
PAUL
My daughter asked me if I was dating. I
didn't know what to say.
ELIZABETH
You're having an affair with one of your
attorneys.
PAUL
Is it an affair if neither of us is
married?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

ELIZABETH
An affair is any sexual or romantic
relationship of an informal or temporary
nature.

PAUL
Thank you, counsellor.
Silence. Then:
PAUL (CONT'D)
I read your brief on the Nelligan case.
It's outstanding. You cited Escalante
vs. L.A. County -- that's a pretty
obscure case but it's perfect for this.
Good work.
She smiles.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I've recommended you to lead the Thomas
and Thompson team.
A beat.
ELIZABETH
Do you think that's going to go over
well with Guinness and Wilder and all
your wonder boys out there?
PAUL
They'll have to eat it. It's still my
law firm.
She nods.
ELIZABETH
I'm going to have to pass. Thank you,
though.
Paul laughs.
PAUL
What are you talking about?
ELIZABETH
When I've been here long enough to win
this kind of promotion, I'll take it. I
know I deserve it -- just give me a
chance to earn it.

39.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

He's taken aback at first, them smiles.
PAUL
What do you want for yourself -professionally?
ELIZABETH
I want to sit on the Circuit Court of
Appeals.
PAUL
You've been with four firms in three
cities in ten years. It's not a good
strategy. You have to sit tight in one
place -- develop the relationships that
are going to win you the appointments.
ELIZABETH
That's not how I like to live my life.
I'll get there. There are many ways to
skin a cat.

After sex. Karen and Tom are still in bed, in silence.
Then Karen gets up and begins to dress. Tom looks on.
When Karen is dressed she stands there for a moment looks
at him and he looks back at her but says nothing. Then:
KAREN
You haven’t asked me anything. About
what it’s been like for me. All of it.
All this time.

What did --.

TOM

Karen makes a gesture -- don’t speak. He stops.

I thought you might like them.
KAREN
What made you think that, you jerk?
Paco says nothing.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I don't appreciate walking into my place
of work and finding this bag hanging
there for everyone to see -- like I’m
your god-damn girlfriend.
Karen shoves the bag in his stomach.
KAREN (CONT'D)
You're an idiot.
Karen walks away leaving him holding onto the bag. Paco
is angry now. He walks quickly and catches up to her.

Hey! (He yells) Hey! The word is

STEVEN
Do you want something to drink?
Elizabeth shakes no while looking at the many photographs
on the mantelpiece. Presiding over them is a large one of
Tracy and Steven on their wedding day, very formally
dressed and flanked by bridesmaids and ushers. Elizabeth
turns towards Steven and chuckles.
Is this fun?

STEVEN (CONT'D)
She shakes no.
ELIZABETH
There are no surprises here.
Elizabeth walks down the hall. She opens a door and looks
inside. It's a small bedroom already set up as a nursery.
There are unopened gifts around.
Elizabeth heads into the bedroom and surveys the area.
From where he's standing Steven can't see her. She opens
the top drawer of a chest and finds Tracy's underwear.
She quickly takes off her own panties, folds them
carefully and places them under Tracy's.
Outside Steven looks at his watch.
ELIZABETH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Let's get going, cowboy.
Steven walks to the bedroom and finds Elizabeth waiting
on the bed, belly down. She has pulled up her skirt to
reveal that she's not wearing underwear.

I am not a weirdo -- but I am difficult.
I don't make new friends easily. I
demand a lot from others -- it's unfair
but I do. I don't like to be
disappointed. And you took me by
surprise. You took me by surprise with
your attention.

match I want you to come to the birthing
class with me -- but not your husband. I
don't want him at the birth either -just you. And I want to be able to name
the baby myself. After that, it's
goodbye. That's the deal.
A beat.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
Karen prunes roses in her front yard. The sound of the
vacuum cleaner is coming from inside the house. Through a
window Karen sees Sofia’s daughter Cristi moving a chair
in the kitchen. She places it against the counter and
gets on top of the chair, trying to reach an upper
cabinet. She still can't reach what she wants so she
climbs on to the counter. This is enough for Karen, who
rushes to the kitchen back door.

62

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
KAREN
What are you doing?
The girl is startled.
KAREN (CONT'D)
Get down. You're going to kill yourself.
The girl gets down, clearly intimidated by Karen's tone.
She pushes the chair back to its place.
Karen walks in, looks inside the cabinet and takes out a
bag of cookies. She shows them to the girl who says
nothing. After a beat Karen takes out a cookie and offers
it to the girl.
KAREN (CONT'D)
Here you go, you little thief.
The girl does not take the cookie.
KAREN (CONT’D)
Go ahead. Take it.
The girl doesn’t move.
Take it.

KAREN (CONT'D)
It's somewhat of an order. The girl takes the cookie but
does not eat it. Karen waits. Finally the girl takes a
tiny nibble. Karen smiles, pleased with herself.

But now Karen notices something that upsets her. She
takes a small pendant of the Virgin Mary that hangs from
the girl's neck and examines it. Angry, Karen reaches
around the back of the girl's neck and undoes the chain.

INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

64

Karen storms into the room where Sofia is cleaning. She
has the necklace in one hand and she is holding on to the
girl's wrist with the other.
KAREN
What is this?
Sofia turns off the vacuum cleaner.
KAREN (CONT'D)
What the hell is she doing with this
necklace?
SOFIA
You're hurting her, Karen.
KAREN
What the hell is she doing with this?
SOFIA
You're hurting her.
Karen lets go of the girl who walks to her mother.
SOFIA (CONT'D)
Your mother gave it to her.
She did not.

KAREN
SOFIA
For her birthday.
KAREN
This belonged to her mother. She did not
gave it to you.
SOFIA
She did. Your mother was a very generous
person.
Karen is bewildered to hear this and says nothing.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

SOFIA (CONT'D)
She was a wonderful woman.
After a beat Sofia turns on the vacuum cleaner and goes
back to work. For a moment Karen does not move. Then she
speaks up.
KAREN
Turn that thing off!
Sofia turns off the vacuum cleaner.
KAREN (CONT'D)
What else did she give you?
Sofia thinks about it.
SOFIA
A photo of herself.
Why?

KAREN
SOFIA
I asked her for it. Why is this
upsetting to you?
KAREN
It's not upsetting. I'm not upset. I'm
just wondering what's going in my own
house.
A beat.
KAREN (CONT'D)
Did my mother ever talk to you about me?
Sometimes.

SOFIA
KAREN
What did she say?
Sofia shrugs "I don't know".
KAREN (CONT'D)
What did she say?
A beat.
KAREN (CONT’D)
What the hell did she say?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

SOFIA
She said you were not happy.
A beat.
What else?

KAREN
SOFIA
She said it was her fault.
Karen is surprised to hear this.
KAREN
She said that? When did she say that?
What were her words?
SOFIA
I can't remember the exact words. She
blamed herself.
A beat.
KAREN
Did she tell you what happened?
Sofia shakes no. Then:
SOFIA
She said she had ruined your life and
that she was very sorry for that.
A beat. Karen eyes begin to fill with tears.
KAREN
Why didn't she say that to me? Why the
hell didn't she say it to me? Why did
she say it to you? She had to say it to
me!
Sofia says nothing while Karen cries openly. After a
while:
SOFIA
I think she was scared of you.

INT. DR. STONE’S EXAM ROOM - AFTERNOON
Elizabeth is waiting in an examination room. DR. ELEANOR
STONE, a woman Elizabeth's age, comes into the room.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

ELEANOR
Hello -- I'm Dr. Stone.
Hi.

ELIZABETH
Eleanor looks at the chart.
ELEANOR
Elizabeth Joyce. Who referred you?
ELIZABETH
You're on a list of doctors who consult
for Walsh, Connery and Lewis. I'm one of
their attorneys.
ELEANOR
Okay. You do look familiar, though.
ELIZABETH
We've never met.
A beat. Eleanor sits.
ELEANOR
What can I do for you?
ELIZABETH
I'm a month late with my period.
ELEANOR
Are you sexually active?
ELIZABETH
I'm not pregnant.
ELEANOR
What do you do for birth control?
ELIZABETH
My tubes are tied.
Eleanor takes notes.
ELEANOR
How long have they been tied?
ELIZABETH
Since I was seventeen.
Eleanor looks at Elizabeth.

51.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

ELEANOR
That's unusual.
Elizabeth says nothing.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
It's not a procedure performed on minors
-- except for medical reasons.
ELIZABETH
I had them tied in a clinic across the
border. They didn't know I was a minor.
Eleanor takes this in.
ELEANOR
Any other problems? Abdominal pain -cramps -- fever?
No.

ELIZABETH
ELEANOR
Let me have a look at you.
Elizabeth reaches under the paper gown and removes her
underwear. Meanwhile Eleanor puts on a latex glove and
examines Elizabeth's face.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Lie back, please.
Elizabeth does.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Where you at USC law?
Elizabeth is surprised to hear the question.
Yes.

ELIZABETH
ELEANOR
I think we have met. I was friends with
Sophie Sparrow and Nina Marshall.
Elizabeth sits up again.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
They lived next door to you. We never
really spoke. You were a little
intimidating.

52.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

53.

Elizabeth stands and reaches for her skirt and underwear.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
ELIZABETH
I don't appreciate looking back on my
life with someone I've known all of two
minutes.
ELEANOR
I'm sorry -- I didn't mean anything by
it.
Elizabeth is putting her clothes back on.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Look -- I am sorry. It was bad timing
and unprofessional. I haven't seen
Sophie in fifteen years and I don't
presume to know anything about you.
Please forgive me.
Elizabeth stops, apparently satisfied with the apology.
She removes her underwear again and lies back on the
table. Eleanor examines her quickly.
Okay.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Elizabeth sits up again.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
I'll have the nurse take a blood sample - and urine.
Eleanor is puzzled by the reply but Elizabeth offers no
more. She hands Elizabeth her file.
ELEANOR (CONT’D)
You could be pregnant. It's not
impossible.
I'm not.
Eleanor leaves.

EXT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON
Leticia is at the cash register, closing up. Ray is
watching through the glass doors. Ray tries to open the
door but it’s locked. She knocks on the glass. Leticia
sees her but goes back to her work, ignoring her. Ray
knocks again but since Leticia continues to ignore her,
Ray bangs loudly on the glass door with both fists.
Leticia hangs tough, ignoring her.
Finally Leticia shouts from where she is:
LETICIA
Will you stop that!
Ray stops. Leticia walks over, unlocks the door and lets
her in.
LETICIA (CONT’D)
The plan is to get me fired?
RAY
He would never fire you.
Leticia heads back to the cash register.
LETICIA
He already did. I begged to get my job
back. On my knees, honey.
RAY
Why, mom? Why do you do that to
yourself?
LETICIA
Ray: I’m an addict and a felon and I’m
on probation -- does that ring a bell?
Ray says nothing.
LETICIA (CONT’D)
Look at the breasts on you.
She touches her breasts.
RAY
I found a couple.
Leticia says nothing.
RAY (CONT’D)
We’re a good match.

LETICIA
Because you say “Jump!” And they say
“How high?”.
Shut up.

RAY

Leticia returns to her paperwork.
LETICIA
How’s school?
RAY
I made Phi Beta Kappa.
Really?

LETICIA

RAY
Really. Big surprise?
LETICIA
No. Good. It’s a good thing. I was happy
when I made Phi Beta Kappa.
Ray says nothing.
LETICIA (CONT'D)
I’m having a little cook-out this
weekend -- with May and Kathleen. Can
you put up with that?
RAY
Can I put up with that? Is that an
invitation?
LETICIA
Yes. I’m sorry -- yes. Will you come?
We’ll celebrate.
RAY
We’ll celebrate what?
LETICIA
I don’t know. My grandchild?

LETICIA (CONT’D)

On her way out Ray messes up folded clothes on a table.

Karen sits on her mother’s unmade bed, still visibly
upset. Sofia and Cristina come to the door.
SOFIA
I'm all done, Karen.
Sofia holds up the pendant.
SOFIA (CONT'D)
You should have this.
Karen shakes no. Sofia signals to Cristi.
Thank you.

CRISTI
After a beat:
SOFIA
You can pay me next week.
Sofia and the girl leave.

INT. ELIZABETH’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Elizabeth is at work. Paul comes in with a cup of coffee
for her. She’s pleased to see him.
ELIZABETH
Oh, thanks. Sit.
He does. She returns to work and he just watches.
Finally:
What?

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)

He shakes “nothing”. She waits.
PAUL
Have you ever looked for your biological
parents?
No.

ELIZABETH

PAUL
They may be looking for you.

68

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

ELIZABETH
There is no "they." The father is not a
part of my imagination.
A beat.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I live in her home town -- how hard
could it be for Her Fucking Majesty to
find me?
Paul says nothing.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
It's better this way. We're all better
off like this.
She returns to her work.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Why do you ask?
PAUL
Because I think she would be very
pleased with who you are.
She says nothing. Then:
PAUL (CONT’D)
Spending time with you out of work is
delightful. It's more than delightful.
The truth is ever since you landed here
I don't know whether I'm coming or
going. You want things the way you want
them -- I like that. Your willfulness is
a great part of your charm. But it's
getting a little scary for me -- feeling
like this. I'm going to have to bow out.
A beat.
ELIZABETH
You don't seem like a man scared by
scary things.
PAUL
It's a precaution. Sometimes when you
fall, it's hard to get up.
He leaves.

The doorbell rings again. Karen looks at her watch and
gets up quickly, fixing her hair and rumpled clothes.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Karen turns on lights on her way to the door. Before she
opens it she pulls her head together. It's Paco.
PACO
Hi. I'm I early?
KAREN
No -- it's fine.
She opens the door wider and he walks in. They stand
there in awkward silence. Finally:
KAREN (CONT'D)
Look -- I'm sorry. It's not a good time
for me. I don't think I can -Paco's reaction is small but clear: it's always something
with this woman. A beat.
KAREN (CONT'D)
Give me five minutes, okay?
He nods. She exits.
71

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
Later. Paco and Karen walk in silence to his car. He
opens the door for her and she sits in. He sits behind
the wheel. Karen is practically absent.
PACO
I thought we'd go to the Shadow Grill in
Burbank. Do you know it?
She shakes no.
PACO (CONT'D)
It's a good place.
She nods okay. He starts the car.

71

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

59.

KAREN
I want to say something to you.
A beat. He turns the car off again.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I had a baby girl when I was fourteen
and she was given up for adoption.
She waits for a reaction but Paco says nothing.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I don't know where she is. I don't know
who she is. Everything I do -- every
thought in my head takes me back to her.
Everywhere I go I look for her face in a
crowd but I don't know what she looks
like. I write her letters that I never
send. I buy her birthday gifts. I have a
name for her: Rachel. I don't even know
if she's dead or alive.
A beat.
KAREN (CONT'D)
That's who I am. I have nothing else. I
have nothing to give.
She's done and she seems depleted. Paco places his hand
on her knee for her to hold. She puts her hand in his and
he holds it tight. After a few moments she asks:
KAREN (CONT'D)
Where on earth did you come from?
He says nothing.
72

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Elizabeth is waiting. Eleanor comes in.
ELEANOR
Hello, Elizabeth. How is everything?
You tell me.

ELIZABETH
ELEANOR
You are pregnant.
Silence from Elizabeth.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
It happens rarely, with tied tubes, but
it happens. Talk to the girls up front
about coming in and we'll take care of
it.
Eleanor writes quickly in the file.
ELEANOR (CONT'D)
Then we'll talk about other methods of
birth control, okay?
Eleanor smiles at her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there,
lost in thought. Finally she walks out. She stops for a
moment at the nurses area. There are patients and other
doctors and nurses around and it’s quite busy.
Suddenly, with surprising ferocity and speed, Elizabeth
flails her arms around and begins hitting everything
within her reach: files, a bowl of candy, a computer
screen, a bulletin board full of baby pictures, a
Rolodex, pens, magazines. The outburst lasts only a few
seconds, long enough for all activity to stop and for
Eleanor to rush out of a room.
Elizabeth walks right up to her face.
ELIZABETH
You don’t know who I am or what I want,
you cunt.
Elizabeth leaves.

Elizabeth walks into the elevator. She stands there,
still stunned by the news. The doors close. Elizabeth

After hours. Lucy and her mother clean up behind the
counter.
ADA
And who is the father?
LUCY
She won't say.

74

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

ADA
But she knows who it is.
LUCY
I don't know. Yes. Why wouldn't she?
Ada shrugs. A pause.
ADA
How old is she?
LUCY
She's twenty-one -- and she's already a
senior at Cal Tech.
ADA
And she's had all the medical tests and
everything?
LUCY
Mom -- you're putting me in a bad mood.
ADA
When can I meet her?
Never.

LUCY
ADA
I thought that was one of her
conditions. One of her many conditions.
Lucy says nothing.
ADA (CONT'D)
I bet if I met her I'd be able to see
right through her.
LUCY
What? Regarding what?
ADA
Whatever it is she's playing at.
Lucy looks at her mother wondering what this is all
about.
LUCY
English, please.
ADA
I don’t think this girl --.

She walks off.

INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Elizabeth sits on the floor sipping a cup of tea. TWO MEN
work around her, carrying boxes.
Elizabeth hears loud voices. It seems that Tracy and
Steven are having a good fight.
76

EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK
Elizabeth rings the doorbell and waits. A woman of
thirty, MARIA, opens the door. Voices can be heard
inside.
ELIZABETH
Hi. I'm looking for Paul.
MARIA
Is he expecting you?
ELIZABETH
I'm from the office. Elizabeth.
MARIA
Oh, sure. I’m Maria, Paul’s daughter.
They shake.
Come in.
It’s okay.

MARIA (CONT'D)
ELIZABETH
MARIA
No -- come in. He’s on the phone.
She walks in reluctantly. Maria leads the way.

76

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

63.

ELIZABETH
I’ll wait here.
MARIA
You can’t just stand there. Come on.
She follows to the dining room where a large table sits
Paul’s FAMILY: his son JULIAN is also there as well as
both of Paul’s children’s SPOUSES. An OLDER WOMAN who
must be Paul’s mother, four or five CHILDREN of various
ages and a COUPLE that is Paul’s brother with his wife.
The group of almost 15 is in the middle of an animated
discussion that involves people talking at the same time
and teasing and prodding one another. It’s a warm
feeling.
Paul is pacing in the background on the phone. He is
surprised to see Elizabeth but apparently can’t get off
the phone so he signals to her “give me a minute”.
Maria addresses the table:
MARIA (CONT’D)
Everyone, this is Elizabeth from dad’s
firm.
Greetings from many of them. Elizabeth smiles briefly.
Paul’s son JULIAN gets up and pulls up a chair for her.
It’s okay.
Please, sit.

ELIZABETH
JULIAN

MARIA
He’ll be off in a minute.

JULIAN
Have you had dinner?

ELIZABETH
No. I mean, no, thanks.
MARIA
How about something to drink?
I’m okay.

ELIZABETH

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09

Elizabeth nods and sits. She looks around at everyone, as
much of a fish out of water as we have ever seen her, in
the midst of the animated family.
Elizabeth’s eyes meet with the OLDER LADY’S, who must be
Paul’s mother. The woman smiles at her, friendly. A
LITTLE BOY of about one also looks at her with curiosity.
Paul finally hangs up and observes her in silence. She
seems like a lost child, almost physically smaller.
Finally Elizabeth sees him and he gestures: meet me out
there.
77

INT. FOYER - THAT MOMENT
Elizabeth walks in and is met by Paul.
PAUL
Hey -- is everything okay?
ELIZABETH
Yes. That’s --.
He wants to say something about his family but can’t find
words.
PAUL
Stay. Have dinner with us.
I can't.

ELIZABETH
PAUL
Of course you can.
No.

ELIZABETH

She means it. A beat.
PAUL

She thinks about it and shrugs -- she has no good answer.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Is it something that I did or did not
do?
No.

ELIZABETH
A beat.
PAUL
The wind changed, is that it?
She nods yes and walks to the front door and opens it and
turns to say goodbye. But before she can say a word Paul
steps forward and embraces her. A big burst of laughter
can be heard coming from the dining room.
After a moment he breaks the embrace and takes one last,
good look at her. He kisses her forehead and goes back
inside, closing the door behind him.

Views of the San Fernando valley.
A sprinkler watering a front yard. A crow eating crumbs
of bread in a parking lot. A few children in the

turn on.

BOYS, 7 years of age.
Other couples, some with brides in full wedding gowns,
wait their turn.
82

EXT. PARK - DAY

82

Sunday and the park is quite full of families, mostly
Latinos. A loud soccer game with people of all ages is in
the background.
Karen and Paco are at a picnic table with his daughter
MELISSA. Her twin boys play in the background. Melissa is
serving a plate of food for Paco.
PACO
Thanks, mija.
MELISSA
Karen -- you want white or dark?
KAREN
Oh, no -- I can do that.
MELISSA
No -- I want to.
White.

KAREN

She serves Karen.
KAREN (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Thank you. Wow. I’m not used to this.
MELISSA
This is how I want it to be between us.
As Karen tries her food Melissa lowers her head and
whispers Grace. Karen is embarrassed to have started
eating. When Melissa is done she makes the sign of the
cross and eats too. Paco has eaten through all this,
unconcerned.
KAREN
I’m always rushing to eat like a hog.

Oh, no. You’ve got yourself confused
with my dad.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2/3/09
MELISSA (CONT'D)
Has he told you that he doesn’t believe
in God? The most kind-hearted man in the
world has turned his back on Jesus.
Paco says nothing.
MELISSA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Jesus would never turn his back on you,
pop.
Paco gives her a look.
MELISSA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Okay, okay -- I’ll stop. One day we’ll
be in Heaven laughing at these
arguments.
PACO
If I’m in Heaven I won’t be laughing.
Someone will have a lot of explaining to
do.
MELISSA
What’s to explain? All wickedness and
cruelty is human. All love is God’s
love. Karen, you’re a good woman -- you
must feel the love of Mary in your
heart.
Karen says nothing. Silence while they eat. Then:
MELISSA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
My dad has told me about your loss.
Karen is taken by surprise.
PACO
She doesn’t like to talk about it.
MELISSA
Sometimes it’s hard to understand God’s
design.
Melissa.

PACO

Silence. Karen is a little shaken.
May I speak?
Karen waits.

MELISSA

MELISSA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
You are my father’s wife now. My
children will grow to know you as their
grandmother. They will learn to love you
as my father loves you - as I hope to
love you. Because it’s the time spent
together that counts. More than blood.
Time counts the most.
Karen says nothing.
MELISSA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Find her now -- before time runs out.
After that only regret remains. And
regret is a killer.
Karen sits perfectly still, tense, revealing nothing.

A different apartment. Elizabeth is on the bed reading a
magazine. She changes position and her robe opens,
revealing her seven month belly.
83

INT. AMANDA’S LAW OFFICE - DAY
A small law office, much less elegant than Paul’s.
Elizabeth sits across from a Mexican-American woman in
her fifties, AMANDA. Amanda reads Elizabeth’s resume.
AMANDA
Well, Elizabeth, to say that you’re
grossly over-qualified would be putting
it mildly. I couldn’t possibly afford
someone like you -- though I’d like to,
believe me.
ELIZABETH
I don’t care about the money.
AMANDA
I can’t offer you benefits.
ELIZABETH
I’m not looking for them. I’ve got
plenty of my own insurance.

83

AMANDA
The job is on a project-by-project
basis.
ELIZABETH
It’s fine. For the kind of work that you
do, for a firm of this size -- for the
means of your clients -- it’s all fine.
Amanda considers this.
AMANDA
Do you know what you’re having?
After a beat Elizabeth shakes no.
AMANDA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
What are your alternatives? What would
you do if you didn’t get this job?
ELIZABETH
Stay at home and watch game shows.
Amanda smiles then looks at Elizabeth’s papers again.
AMANDA
I don’t know what to make of you.
ELIZABETH
I’m just passing through.

Lucy is serving a cup of tea to Ray, who is almost nine
months pregnant.
It’s hot.

LUCY

Ray drinks from it anyway.
LUCY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
I’ve always wanted to ask you what
happened. How you got pregnant.
RAY

no idea who it is.
Lucy thinks about it.

RAY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
Wherever he is he wakes up in the
morning and goes on about his life and
he doesn’t know he’s a father.
LUCY
Would you recognize him if you saw him?
Ray shakes no. Then:
RAY
It’s frightening, isn’t it? How
disposable men are.
Lucy says nothing. Ray puts her hand on her belly.
What?

LUCY

Ray looks at Lucy, then takes Lucy’s hand and places it
on the pregnant belly. Movement.
Jesus.

LUCY (cont’d) (CONT’D)

Lucy is very still, transported. She closes her eyes,
concentrated on feeling movement. Ray looks at her
carefully, at how moved Lucy is.
Ray then shifts position, essentially moving her belly

Because whatever happens when you meet

KAREN
Why haven’t you told me this before?
PACO
I was working towards it.
Karen thinks about it.
PACO (CONT’D)
She may be looking for you. Have you
thought about that?
KAREN
There’s nothing I haven’t thought of.
PACO
Would you know where to start?
She thinks about it, then nods. A beat.
PACO (CONT’D)
What is your biggest fear?

INT. JOANNA’S OFFICE - DAY
Karen and Paco sit across from Sister Joanna. Karen is

Sister Joanne comes in with a note pad and sits.
SISTER JOANNE
You delivered on November 7, 1973. Your
mother was the legal guardian of the
baby girl -- you agreed to that before
the baby was born.
Both Sister Joanne and Paco look at Karen who says
nothing.

SISTER JOANNE (CONT’D)
(cont’d)
A couple took the child on November 10.
Unfortunately the provisions of the
adoption do not allow me to give out any
information regarding the identity of
the parties involved. What you can do is
write a letter to her. The letter is
kept in the file and if she were ever to
contact us we would give her the letter
and she would be free to reach out to
you directly.
A beat.
SISTER JOANNE (CONT’D)
(cont’d)
I’m sorry. That’s the best I can do.
A long beat. Finally:
KAREN
If she had been here you would have told
her the same thing?
SISTER JOANNE
That’s right.
KAREN
So if she was here she didn’t leave me a
letter.
SISTER JOANNE
There’s no letter in the file.
KAREN
So she’s either not looking or doesn’t
want to write to me. Or she thinks I’m
not looking for her.
PACO
Maybe she doesn’t know where to look.
Karen says nothing.
SISTER JOANNE
I really encourage you to write a
letter. It works. People find each
other. I’ve seen it many times.
Karen thinks about it, then shakes her head no.

Anything to report?
ELIZABETH
I’ve had a little spotting. Last week

The doctor runs his hands over Elizabeth’s belly. There
is a point in the lower abdomen that makes Elizabeth
flinch.
DR. MORGAN
Does that hurt?
A little.

ELIZABETH

DR. MORGAN
Has long have you had this?
She thinks about it.
I’m not sure

ELIZABETH

The doctor presses again. Elizabeth reacts again.

Have you had any fever?
No.

EXT. ROOF TOP - AFTERNOON
The roof top of an apartment building. Elizabeth lies
face up on a beach towel, sunbathing. She is wearing
shorts and a bikini top. The sound of a door opening and
closing makes her turn and cover herself. A GIRL OF
FIFTEEN walks out, leading with a white cane. She's
blind.
Elizabeth observes the girl as she takes a chair that’s
folded up against the wall, walks to the middle of the
roof area, sits and takes in the sun then puts on an
Ipod.
Elizabeth folds her towel and walks towards the door. The
girl, VIOLET, speaks up.
Who's there?

VIOLET
ELIZABETH
I'm a tenant. I was sunbathing.
VIOLET
Careful up here -- it’s a big drop.
The advise makes Elizabeth smile.
ELIZABETH
Okay. Thank you.
I'm Violet.

She offers her hands and Elizabeth walks over to shake
it.

My mother wants me to be in radio. She

make my way.
ELIZABETH
Does radio interest you?
VIOLET
I don't know what interests me. I
sometimes tell her I could have a career
in phone sex. She's humorless. Do you
know anyone else in the building?
No.

ELIZABETH

VIOLET
I'm always here in the afternoons. My
mother takes a nap from five to six and
the silence in the apartment drives me
crazy. It's the sleep of the High

Okay.

The truth is I have no idea. She gave me
up for adoption when I was born. We’ve

Aren’t you ever scared that --. That -something --. That she could --.
She trails off, unable to find the words.
SOFIA
That she could fall and break like an
egg?

honest and Sofia considers her answer carefully:
SOFIA (CONT’D)
Yes. Sometimes.

were my age?

ELIZABETH
I did. It didn’t scare me either.
Elizabeth thinks about it.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I felt like I wasn’t really there -that I was invisible and disposable -and that the world after me would be
like the world before me. That I
wouldn’t leave a thing behind. It wasn’t
a bad feeling, really. It was comforting
-- to feel like I was nothing.

that he’s singled me out so he deserves
a reward, don’t you think?
Elizabeth smiles.

I suppose he does, yes.

Sometimes when we’re making out I feel
like we’re just -- one person -- all

As they approaches Ray’s room they see a group gathered
at the door. Sister Joanne is here, together with a
DOCTOR and another MAN that looks like a HOSPITAL
ADMINISTRATOR. Further down the hall is a SECURITY GUARD.
Sister Joanne pulls Lucy over to one side and explains
something to her slowly, carefully. Lucy listens in
silence, then reacts badly and begins to scream. She
rushes to the door and bangs on it and screams but is
pulled away by hospital staff and by Ada. Ada tries to
walk her away, but Lucy tries to get back into the room.

kneels and hugs the girl and then just looks at the
girl’s face, long and hard, taking in every detail,
touching her with the tips of her fingers -- like a blind
person trying to memorize the features.
Karen gets up again and they all stand there in silence.
Suddenly Sofia steps up again and embraces Karen quickly
and whispers in her ear:
SOFIA
Your mother loved you more than anything
in the world.
Sofia breaks away and without another look or word she
takes the girl’s hand and they walk away.

LUCY
You were right. If God wanted me to be a
mom he would have made me a mom.
ADA
Lucy, I never said that.
LUCY
The whole adoption thing is just so
fucking -- unnatural. How come no one
will just come out and say it?
The doorbell rings and Ada walks away.
Ada returns followed by Sister Joanne. Lucy sits up
slowly when Sister Joanne walks in.
Sister Joanne sits. Ada remains standing.
LUCY (CONT’D)
I don’t blame her. I mean, it’s her
child, right? Who would give up her
child that didn’t have to?
SISTER JOANNE
Lucy. There’s another baby.

Oh, for god’s sake --.

No.

SISTER JOANNE
That’s not going to happen.
ADA
I think you better leave.
Mom --.

LUCY

Ada backs off.
LUCY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
Is this a baby that was meant for
someone else?
SISTER JOANNE
No. Absolutely not. There are waiting
lists but --. Look -- it’s already
arranged -- if you want it.
LUCY
Where is the mother?
SISTER JOANNE
There is no one. There isn’t, okay?
Sometimes there’s just nobody. This is
one of those times.
Lucy doesn’t take her eyes off Sister Joanne. A beat.

KAREN (cont’d) (CONT’D)
She could be very funny, you know. When
I was little she would dress me up in
her clothes and paint my face and we
would put on these little musical shows
and laugh like crazy. She once peed in
her pants, she was laughing so hard. I
hadn’t thought about that in years.
A beat.
KAREN (cont’d) (CONT’D)
She loved everything that I wrote and
she encouraged me. She had high hopes
for me. All her hopes were for me,
really -- she had none for herself. That
was scary. And then when I got pregnant
something broke inside of her and she
never recuperated.

KAREN (cont’d) (CONT’D)
She was capable of a lot of love, once.
And it was all for me.
She cuddles up to him.

Elizabeth, rifles through cardboard boxes quickly,
picking out a photo album, looking through it and taking
a little photograph.
She puts the album away and turns to leave but stops and
looks around and breaths in the smell of the place. She
closes her eyes.
When she finally opens her eyes we see how hard the
memories are for her. She walks to the window and looks

Lucy thinks about it.

Lucy nods. The baby cries harder. Then harder. Lucy
whispers.

Elizabeth writes a letter.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
I was born November 7, 1973. I don’t
want to impose myself on you. I don’t
want to be a nuisance. I am pregnant and
I’d like my baby to know where she comes
from. I live in Los Angeles. I am
successful in my work and financially
independent. I am open to sharing more
about myself and if you were open to
that as well, it would be welcome. If
you don't want to communicate with me, I
will also understand and accept it.

ELIZABETH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
If we were to meet, I think we should
look forward, not back, and build
something new. My name is Elizabeth. I
think of you often.
Her writing the letter is intercut with Elizabeth setting
up a camera and sitting for a self-portrait.

After Elizabeth has left, the man puts the letter on his

A couple of nurses and a doctor move around Elizabeth, as
the work climate in the room seems to become more tense

Then, as the baby’s face is pulled away Elizabeth’s eyes
lose their focus. The color is draining from her face.

claim over the baby. Legally Elizabeth
was not your child, so you have no claim
over her children. Also, after
Elizabeth’s death, a legal, good-faith
effort was made to publish the news of
her death and to look for relatives.

What kind of effort?

Paco is fast asleep. Karen is writing in her notebook.
KAREN (V.O.)
I never saw you. With a new haircut.
With new shoes. When was your first
period? Was someone there to help? Did
anyone explain? Did you hear the rain
one night, when I heard it? What gave
you comfort? I've missed it all -- and
I’ve accepted it. But today I met Ella.
Her little face is like a bird that
flies high over thirty-eight years that
have gone on and on and on like a
horrible parade. But now it has passed.
Only Ella remains, God bless her. Ella
is peace.
She picks up the envelope that Sister Joanne gave her
(it’s already been opened by her before) and takes out a
letter and two photos. She reads the letter and it makes
her smile.
Karen puts the notebook aside and rests the photos on her
side table and lies down to look at them. One photo is
the self-portrait of a pregnant Elizabeth, the other is
the school photo of Elizabeth, age 8.
Karen looks at them -- scared, curious, marvelled -- then
turns out the lights.
