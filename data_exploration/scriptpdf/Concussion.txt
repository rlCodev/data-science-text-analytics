OPEN ON EXTENDED TITLES, A CUT ASSEMBLY OF HOME MOVIE AND TV
FOOTAGE:
1

1) Rhinelander High, Wisconsin. 1970. Rockwellian Americana:
football cheerleaders, full stands in tribal green & white,
convoys of yellow buses. Then--

2

2) A teenage MIKE WEBSTER playing for the Hodags. Biggest
thing on the field, an unstoppable machine. Now--

3

3) Mike has broken his arm, holds up his cast, big smile,
proud warrior. Then--

4

4) Mike is 22, wearing Pittsburgh Steelers practice uni,
first day in camp. Alone against the mountainous men, a
hazing. Infamous “nutcracker” drill - percussive hits like
car head-ons, gun-shots. Coaches screaming: “Who’s a man?!
Who’s tough?! Who’s gonna hit somebody!?”

5

5) Webster - now 27, thicker, less joyful - wins ABC Wide
World of Sports’ “Strongest Man in Football” contest. Then--

6

6) Footage of the interior game. Steelers vs. Somebody.
Webster vs. The World. Men as big as walls, and when Webster
hits his, shovel-sized hands clap his ear-holes. Lightning
bolts through his body, face in paralytic shock, and now--

7

7) Webster showers in post-game confetti winning his fourth
Super Bowl ring. Shoulder-presses the Vince Lombardi
championship trophy. His countenance primal. Now--

8

8) Back to that hit: Webster’s helmet knocked off, left arm
briefly hangs numb. Somebody’s screaming, “That’s it! Now
that’s how you gotta hit him!” And now--

9

9) A suddenly old-looking Webster roughing it through the
“nutcracker”. This time steamrolled by a new young Steelers’
bad-ass, bearded, mountain-sized. Then--

10

10) The hit again. Webster getting up slow. Through his haze,
hears: “That’s it! Kill the head the body will die! KILL THE
HEAD THE BODY WILL DIE! Now run it again!” Now we find--

11

11) Webster after a game, older, wandering off the field. NowWEBSTER (OVER)

This Hall of Fame class of players
is a tremendous group. Tremendous
people. Not perfect people--

speech in Canton, OH--

WEBSTER (CONT’D)
Not people who are pretentious or
whatever. Real people. And that’s
what the game of football is about.
And more manic, rambling scree. The game he loved. The owners
and coaches. CUTS to crowd - family, players - embarrassed,
wanting this to end.
Then it does. Titles end. Music ends. We cut to black, and-MAN SINGING (PRE-LAP)
(Debarge’s ‘I like it’)
I've been thinkin'/'bout you for
quite a while/You're on my mind
everyday and every night/My every
thought is you, the things you
do/Seems so satisfying to me/I must
confess it, girl-(voice big, melodic if not
great, continuing as we
come up to--)
13

EXT. PITTSBURGH - ESTABLISHING - DAYBREAK
The rust-belt wakes. Iron bridges like spokes of a wheel.
Wrecked fallow mills, reclaimed by nature. The massive brandnew grounded UFO that is Heinz Field, where the Steelers
play. The converging three rivers aflame all the way to the
picket fence of Allegheny Mountains beyond.
TITLE: SEPTEMBER, 2002
MAN SINGING (OVER)
Ooh...and I like it/You send chills
up my spine every time/I take a
look at you/Ooh...and I like it-(now we go into--)

INT./EXT. BENNET’S CAR (MOVING)/PITTSBURGH
A blue Mercedes E320 sedan and find BENNET OMALU, 35,
shamelessly and sweetly singing.
BENNET
I like the way you comb your
hair/And I like those stylish
clothes you wear/It's just the
little things you do/That show how
much you really care-(singing his way through-)

EXT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY CORONER - PITTSBURGH
Bennet pulls up beside his car’s silver twin. Same make and
model. In the shadow of a Victorian stone monolith chalked by
steel-mill soot. Itself in the shadow of a cloverleaf of
humming freeway. And Bennet gets out. And we see-He’s incongruously - exquisitely - dressed. Tailored suit.
Crisp shirt. Expensive tie (Presidential knot). Down a ramp
into a gaping basement, receding down a dark tunnel, we-HEAR - IN PRE-LAP - PEOPLE SINGING (badly) “HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
Happy birthday to you--”

16

INT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY CORONER - PITTSBURGH - MORNING
Four TECHNICIANS celebrating a heavyset man's 50th. Cupcake
scrawled, “Happy Birthday Joe!” Balloon bouquet, a candle.
The break room. With a window letting out on the slabs. Where
a shitbox TV plays Wheel of Fortune.
We’re in the POV of someone watching. The figure coming into
focus in f.g., quarantined, isolated-It’s Bennet. Standing - in scrubs now. Watching the others’
lips moving, laughing. Now grabbing portable CD player, and
back to-BENNET
(pausing at the party)
Gracie, may we begin, please?

INT. AUTOPSY CHAMBER - MORNING
Soaring tiled chapel-like chamber, floors sloped toward
drains. Three steel slabs with fresh corpses in various
states of disrepair, four more in bags against the walls.
While in the b.g., DR. CYRIL WECHT, 60’s, in scrubs, steps
back from a slab to let a TECH finish up. Bennet and Wecht
meet in the middle of the room-BENNET
Good morning, Cyril-As Wecht pats Bennet on the shoulder, moves to table to fill
out forms. Bennet checks the clipboard-BENNET (CONT’D)
(checking the clipboard)
Rachel Green first, please.
GRACIE - early 20’s, blue ribbon (matching her uniform)
twisted through her hair - goes to what was a pretty WOMAN,
like her, early 20’s. Still dressed for last night’s party.
GRACIE
Full or partial, Dr. Omalu?
Bennet reviewing the girl’s file. Police report. Holding up
her driver’s license. Roots around in her purse.
In b.g., prepping his own table, is DANIEL SULLIVAN, 50.
Chief Pathology Supervisor. Bald, dark pouches under his
eyes. Steelers stuff under lab gear. Countenance of an illhumored butcher.
SULLIVAN
Open-shut O.D.-suicide. Full room
today. We need to cycle them
through.
Bennet, moving slow, ignoring him, over the girl’s face, as
if listening.
BENNET
I need your help, Rachel. We’re in
this together. Tell me what
happened to you.
And a hand on the body’s forehead, another over the heart. He
opens her eyes. Stares into them. Connection.
SULLIVAN
Oh here we go.

WECHT
Danny, c’mon. Let him do this
thing. I hired him for a reason.
(to Bennet)
I need to talk to you. Come see me
in my office when you’re done-BENNET
Full autopsy. We’ll need the tissue
dissection station.
Sullivan stops. Glares from his table. As a TRAINEE TECH, 25,
rolls a trolley over.

5.

BENNET (CONT’D)
That’s not mine-Gracie fetches a different trolley. Brand new knives still in
plastic. Scalpels. The instruments longer, more delicate.
GRACIE
(sidebars the trainee)
Dr. Omalu uses different stuff. He
makes less of a mess-As Bennet sets the volume on his CD player-BENNET
Let’s undress her, please.
And feels the fabric of her shirt. The quality. The pattern.
TECH #1
(measuring head to heel)
Sixty-six-and-a-three-eighths.
BENNET
Let’s please wash the body.
And as the Trainee reaches for a Brillo pad, Gracie hands
Bennet a sponge. And he starts carefully swabbing the body
himself. Pats it dry. Lovingly. As if dabbing a baby.
GRACIE
(to the trainee)
He likes to do it himself.
(as--)
Bennet puts on head phones. Through his ears, and ours, come
the opening strains to Teddy Pendergrass’ “Love TKO”.
TEDDY PENDERGRASS (OVER)
Lookin' back over my years/I
guessed, I've shedded some
tears/ Told myself time and
time again/ This time I'm
gonna win--

BENNET
Bone saw, please--

JUMP TO: Bennet hands Gracie an organ. We’re FRAMING high on
him, shoulders, elbows. We know but don’t need to see-TEDDY PENDERGRASS (OVER)
Think I'd better let it
go/Looks like another love
T.K.O.--

GRACIE
Liver nine-hundred fifty-two
grams.

JUMP TO: he hands her another.

Takin' the bumps and the
bruises/Of all the things of
a two-time loser--

BENNET
Small tissue container.
Freeze me a liver sample,
please, Gracie.

And lifts for the bone saw.
JUMP TO: Bennet reaches toward the head. Cradles an orb off
to Gracie as if a fresh loaf of bread.
BENNET (CONT’D)
(Gracie takes dictation--)
Possible causal relationship
between early head trauma and selfmedication leading to narcotics
abuse and overdose-SULLIVAN
(from across room)
You’re not her shrink, Bennet-BENNET
If I know how she lived, I’ll know
why she died.
ANGLE on a window letting out on the chamber. Wecht standing
there watching, shirt and tie, cinching the knot, turning for
the stairs, as-TEDDY PENDERGRASS (OVER)
Just tryin' to hold on, faith is
gone/It's just another sad song-JUMP TO: Gracie’s smock splashed with fluids and blood. (So
is everyone else’s). Bennet’s pristine. Until some small
fleck spray lands, and-He immediately slips off his plastic smock. Gracie - knows
him - slips a fresh one on.
TEDDY PENDERGRASS (OVER) (CONT’D)
Takin' the bumps and the bruises/Of
all the things of a two-time
loser/See I try to hold on, my
faith-Now silence. Body reassembled. Bennet’s fingers resting on
the girl’s hand. Feeling for spiritual pulse. On Bennet’s
face, peace. As Gracie zips up the body bag. And Sullivan
glares-BENNET
Careful, Daniel. One day I might be
rushing through your autopsy.

INT. WECHT’S OFFICE - ALLEGHENY COUNTY CORONER - DAY
Sits across from CYRIL WECHT, Chief Medical Examiner. 60’s,
celebrity pathologist: array of pictures with Elvis’ body;
JonBenet Ramsey's files; at the JFK assassination hearings.
Both in suit and tie. Wecht’s eating a bagel. Pulls a bottle
of Johnny Walker from his drawer and pours a couple.
WECHT
You know the reason you’re not back
in Nigeria?
BENNET
I remind you of you.

WECHT (CONT'D)
Only less handsome.

Wecht motions to Bennet’s collar. Something there. Bennet
brushes it off. And we realize: they are in identical suits.
Except - Wecht points - to Bennet’s chest pocket-WECHT (CONT’D)
I don’t have any. What the hell are
they for, anyway? Just fill up with
schmutz-(nods at autopsy chamber)
What the hell’s going on in there?
BENNET
I’m doing my work. I’m fine.
WECHT
You’re not fine. Danny hates your
guts. I’ve never seen anything like
it.
(pause)
You take too much time, Bennet.
BENNET
The dead are my patients. I treat
them with respect.
WECHT
Treat them however you want, but do
you have to talk to them? Maybe
just talk to them in your head
while you’re - you know - working-(MORE)

WECHT (CONT'D)
(Bennet’s giving nothing)
And we talked about the knives.
You’re still throwing them away.
They’re expensive. This is
Pittsburgh. We’re a public agency.
BENNET
Would you want me to cut open your
mother with the knife I used on a
serial killer?
WECHT
Don’t tempt me. I’d probably
request it.
Wecht sighs. Bennet’s not wrong. But still-WECHT (CONT’D)
Danny may look like a butcher,
smokes three packs a day, but he’s
one of life’s unpleasant
necessities. You’ll probably do his
goddamn autopsy soon-BENNET
That’s what I told him.
WECHT
I know you did. He told me. Why are
you antagonizing him?
(and looks at him)
You need a girlfriend. You have to
touch someone alive once in a
while. Living women are a pain in
the ass. But occasionally they’re
amazing.
(--)
So maybe just a little less of an
artist? Be yourself, just play the
game a little, okay?
(as he slides across a
thick file--)
BENNET
(can’t do it--)
I have exams next week.
WECHT
Death row case. The guy’s being
railroaded. A thousand dollars for
you.
Bennet looks at him.

9.

BENNET
How do you become a professional
expert witness?
WECHT
It’s not a profession, it’s a
hobby. You and I have jobs, right?
So instead of watching baseball or playing bridge with my wife - I
do this. Besides, by the time your
balls are hanging as low as mine,
you better be expert in something.
BENNET
You’re the best, Cyril.
WECHT
Well, if you don’t piss everyone
off, you’re going to be better.
And Bennet leans into crime scene photos, police and
forensics reports. Young woman ripped and bloodied.
20

INT. BENNET’S OFFICE - COUNTY CORONER - NIGHT
Bennet in his shitbox storage closet re-fitted as an office.
(We clock the high-school quality microscope he’s been given.
The crappy ancient computer. All his framed degrees stacked
on the floor; no room to hang even one)
He roots in his pocket for a small rusty crucifix, sets it on
his desk, and settles in amidst boxes of files. Crime scene
photos. Bearing down into the paper with his machine-like
focus.
Then stops. Closes the file. Gets up, reaching for his coat-Now, OVER this, in PRE-LAP, we start to HEAR the infinity
thud of contempo-dance, and we cut to--

21

INT. STATIC (DANCE CLUB) - PITTSBURGH, PA - NIGHT
8,000 sq. ft. of throbbing university jocks, yuppies, model
wannabes. Celo lights strobing to Kylie Minogue.
CAMERA FINDS BENNET flush to a speaker, gripping a Heineken.
Fastidiously dressed even here, pressed jeans, buttoned polo.
Good with rhythm, willing the bass and music to wash through.

10.

But a man apart in every way: he’s black, but no one else
here is. Doesn’t notice, doesn’t care. Just grooves solo to
the mathematics of the music. His eyes close, and-We MUTE and go in there. His head. Where there’s nothing but
limbic throb. And disconnect. And so peace. His face placid.
Happy. HOLD a long beat, then-22

IT’S 3AM
And we’ve gone ravey electronica. Bennet’s moves liquid. More
of that peace. HOLD on him in his solo bliss, then cut to--

23

INT. BENNET’S CONDO - NIGHT/PRE-DAWN
EYES FOCUSED like cameras on the crime scene photos from the
death row case. Spread across a kitchen table.
BACK TO REVEAL Bennet, there, still in club clothes. The
notes he takes calligraphy-neat.
Bachelor pad sparse. Microscope on the table. Forest of text
books. Squared and aligned, like his-Closet. Shirts and suits precision-hangered by color. A row
of ties pre-knotted. Shoes lined up like soldiers. Now-Back to Bennet. At his computer. Which we see has a Pope John
Paul II screen-saver. Pope’s watching him. Watching over-Bennet’s searing focus. And then-And Bennet is finally asleep atop his bed. Then--

24

INT. RECEPTION - LAW FIRM - DAY
Pale marble. White leather appointments. A sprawling view of
Pittsburgh. The antisepsis of influence and success.
WE FIND BENNET alone amidst the furniture. Briefcase on his
lap.
JUMP TO SAME AN HOUR LATER. Bennet hasn’t moved. One of the
PARTNERS - MR. CROCKETT - sticks his head in.

CROCKETT
(ignores Bennet)
You sure Dr. Bennet hasn’t come
through? He was supposed to be here
an hour ago.
BENNET
I am Dr. Bennet Omalu.
CROCKETT
Doctor Bennet? Omalu?
(Bennet stands, and--)
RECEPTIONIST
I’m so sorry, Mr. Crockett. I
thought he was here for the clerk
job.
25

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW FIRM - DAY
Partner leads Bennet to a conference room. Huge table covered
in files and laptops. A half-dozen ATTORNEYS huddle waiting.
SCARBOROUGH
(looking up, confused)
Where’s Cyril?
CROCKETT
This is Dr. Bennet Omalu.
BENNET
I work for Dr. Wecht.
(after a pause, you gotta
be kidding me--)
SCARBOROUGH
Our guy’s gonna be put to death in
thirty days, and we were supposed
to get the Hail Mary expert
witness, and Cyril sends us this?
No offense.
BENNET
(a smile, none taken)
Your client didn’t do it.
SCARBOROUGH
We know that.
BENNET
You may know. But I can prove it.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL RIVER BANK - DAY
WIDE of a weed-strewn empty lot. A king-cab Chevy pick-up in
the lee of abandoned construction. Side windows blown,
replaced with garbage bags.
As a Harley bike ENTERS FRAME crossing to the pick-up, cut to-

27

A REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
In them, eyes, slightly mad, trying to recognize their own
reflection. They fill the screen, then we WIDEN TO--

28

INT. CHEVY PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY
MIKE WEBSTER, 50 but looks 70. Unwashed. Hair stringy.
Granular thickness everywhere, forehead barnacled with scars.
Fingers mangled in a permanent curl, as if gripping a ball.
Surrounded by soiled clothes and Ding-Dong wrappers. Crucifix
dangles from the mirror.
Piles of lined yellow paper. Covered edge to edge in scrawl.
An equally massive MAN dismounts the bike: 6’8”, 320 lbs:
JUSTIN STRZELCZYK (Strel-zik), 36. Heavy-bearded, plaid
shirt, overalls. A giant hippie.
STRZELCZYK
Webby, hey man, love your digs!
(no response)
Webby, it’s Jugger!
(then)
Mike. It’s Justin.
(Webster turning his big
head, no recognition)
I’ll just sit with you a minute?
And slips behind the wheel. Smells like ass. On the passenger
seat: container of ammonia; super-glue.
WEBSTER
(awakening to where he is)
Where is this?
STRZELCZYK
This is Ohio. Off some freeway.
WEBSTER
Ohio’s got the best truck stops.

13.

STRZELCZYK
But this ain’t even that. This is -I don’t know what this is.
Strzelczyk picks at the yellow paper. Starts to read. Then.
Reaches for Webster’s knee.
STRZELCZYK (CONT’D)
My brother. Been looking for you.
Pam said I might find you here.
(which taps Webster into
momentary focus)
Juggers.

WEBSTER

STRZELCZYK
We’re all worried about you.
And takes a wad of toilet tissue dipped in ammonia, puts it
to his face. Eyes flare -- “Don’t do that” -- “Keeps me
awake! Don’t want to fall asleep!” -- Strzelczyk grabs for
the wad -- “What the -- Mike!” -- two tree-trunk arms shovelhands slap at it-WEBSTER
Don’t wanna fall asleep don’t wanna
fall asleep can’t fall asleep-A glimpse of the mess of Webster’s mouth: teeth glued back
in, gums bloody.
STRZELCZYK
You gotta let me take you back.
(Webster can’t remember)
You called an audible, Mike. You
took off.
(pause; then)
I heard you sold your Super Bowl
rings. Your rings, man.
Webster non-responsive. Then gets out of the truck. Agitated.
Can’t get the words out. Strzelczyk gets out his side, comes
around. Right up into Webster-STRZELCZYK (CONT’D)
Pam is your wife. Garrett, your boyWEBSTER
(announcer voice)
--was so ugly when he was born his
momma carried him around upside
down for a week, thought he only
had one eye!

Laugh line. But no one laughs.
STRZELCZYK
(squeezes Webster’s hands)
Mike. My knees are shot. I retired.
I’m done. I just wanted you to
know.
(then; afraid)
What happens when Mike Webster
falls asleep?
WEBSTER
He remembers.
STRZELCZYK
I’m starting to forget things,
Webby. I’m hearing myself say this
stupid crap to my kids. I almost
pushed Keana into a wall, man. I
never touched a girl like that.
Webster looks at him. Then getting back into the truck-WEBSTER
Don’t give up, son!
(Strzelczyk leaves a roll
of hundreds, walks)
Finish the game and we’ll all be
winners!
(Strzelczyk gets on his
bike and--)
A28

EXT. STRZELCZYK HOME - PITTSBURGH SUBURBS - DUSK
Big rangy house of a pro athlete. Strzelczyk playing guitar
on his porch, some mournful melody. Soft voice incongruous
with his giantness. Flanked by his SON, 9, DAUGHTER, 6.
Car pulls up. Wife, KEANA -- 30, thin, angular face, the
opposite of Strzelczyk -- crosses to him with groceries.
KEANA STRZELCZYK
He really sell his rings?
(he stops playing--)
STRZELCZYK
That wasn’t Webby. Webby’s gone. I
don’t know who that was.

INT. CHEVY PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY
The plastic bags taped to the windows breathing in and out
like a bellows.
Webster failing at sleep. Stretches across the trash. Then
fetal. Now sits up. Everything hurts. The mosquitoes rage.
Can’t find stillness. He grips his head. Searing hot pain.
He reaches for a Taser. Charges it. The prongs jack up. A
loud crack, like a gunshot. Primed and ready.
He’s sweaty. Desperate for sleep now. Pushes down his pants.
Thigh flesh already burnt. Charred in places.
Brings the Taser to his own meat -- doesn’t even flinch -triggers -- CRACK! -- blue flash. And Webster’s bulk is ragdolled onto the floor of the truck, and we cut to black-OVER BLACK, in PRE-LAP -- RAP RAP RAP -- the crack of metal
on window glass, then--

30

INT./EXT. CHEVY PICK-UP/PARKING LOT - HOSPITAL - MORNING
Webster - hideously unclean, mouth a cesspool - wakes in an
entirely different location. Forehead-down into the steering
wheel. Security Guard, 60, knocking at his window. He opens-SECURITY GUARD
Mike Webster, right? Iron Mike?
Webster isn’t entirely sure. Of that, or how he got here.
Looks up to see he’s parked in front of medical offices.
The guard thrusts his electric bill at him.
SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
Can you sign this? My wife’s gonna.
Freak. Out.
Some part of Webster remembers what to do. He scribbles
something. Then--

31

INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
TIGHT ON A SURGEON peering through magnifiers into the
sheeted window into an open skull. Fingers probe, snip,
suture with the precision of a watch repair. The brain a
living breathing seeping organism. Now surgeon’s done. And
slips down his mask, and we’ve met DR. JULIAN BAILES, 46.
A NURSE - “Dr. Bailes” - whispers in his ear, and--

INT. OFFICE OF CHAIRMAN, DEPT OF NEUROSURGERY - CONTINUOUS
Bailes - still in scrubs - following his ASSISTANT to his
door. Louisiana Methodist. Wrapped tight. Big gold watch.
Steelers Superbowl ring on his hand.
Office draped in family, God and football: bible; framed
photos of southern-belle WIFE, five KIDS; Bailes as college
linebacker; shelf full of helmets: Steelers, Cardinals.
Everything else is Steelers: framed photo of LYNN SWANN midair. Others of Bailes on game-time sidelines. With the
Lombardi Trophy. Under the same post-game confetti as
Webster.
To find Webster pacing in his manic shambles-WEBSTER
What do I do I am freakin
overwhelmed-BAILES
We’re going to get you some
help. What are you taking?

WEBSTER (CONT'D)
Ritalin.

BAILES
What about Dexedrine? The
Prozac? Klonopin? Still
taking all that?

WEBSTER (CONT'D)
Superglue.

BAILES
Call Pam. Tell her we found him.
Tell her he’s worse.
WEBSTER
You -- you were my doctor--

BAILES (CONT'D)
Team doctor, Mike. I was
everybody’s doctor.

Webster punching the side of his head. Bangs his fists
against his prodigious chest.
WEBSTER
Fix it! In here! In here! I’m dying
in here!
Bailes’ Assistant is in with a loaded syringe -- “Haldol 50
cc’s” -- Webster sweaty -- waving his arms. Bailes injects.
As the giant body pours into a chair-BAILES
What am I missing?

Tumor?

INT. COURT ROOM - PITTSBURGH - DAY
The gallery standing room only. The accused, THOMAS KIMBLE
40, hulkish in his orange jumpsuit.
CROCKETT
(to the court)
The state has asked, after a
lengthy trial, a death sentence,
and two appeals, why would we learn
something new about this case from
you?
(then)
Dr. Omalu. Do you have a medical
degree?
BENNET
Yes. From the University of
Nigeria, in Enugu, Nigeria.
(and then)
I did my residency at the Columbia
University Medical School in New
York. I have masters degrees in
Public Health and Epidemiology. In
addition, I am a certified
physician executive, and a
specialist in Emergency medicine.
And I am of course board certified
in Forensic Pathology, Clinical
Pathology and Anatomic Pathology.
My specialty is Neuro-pathology,
the examination of the brain-Crockett about to move in-BENNET (CONT’D)

America, a masters in Theory of
Music from the Royal School of
Music in London.
(big easy smile incongruous
to where he sits, then)
To answer your question, my
specialty is the science of death.
I think more about why people die
than I do about the way people
live.
(room quiet, awestruck)
I very carefully re-studied the
interviews with the defendant, Mr.
Kimble. And of course the autopsy
reports on the victim, who was
killed quite brutally with bare
hands.
Reaches for a stack of blown-up photos. Top photo: hands
shredded, bone-crushed. Grey with death.
BENNET (CONT’D)
Hands of the deceased. Broken
nails. Blood under the nails. Bite
marks. Contusions. The hands of a
woman who fought wildly for her
life - and lost.
Now a set of male hands. Splashed in blood.
CROCKETT
Are these hands not Mr. Kimble’s?
BENNET
They are indeed Mr. Kimble’s.
CROCKETT
Doesn’t that suggest that the state
has the right man?
BENNET
I thought so. Until I heard hour
two-hundred seventeen of Mr.
Kimble’s police interview. He was
speaking quietly, and off-mic, but
I clearly heard him say(reads from notes)
“I don’t like blood. When I was a
kid I had a tooth pulled and I
wouldn’t stop bleeding. My parents
wouldn’t let me play outside
somtimes--”

And we REVERSE on the Prosecutor. On the cusp of realization-BENNET (CONT’D)
I saw no reference to this in any
trial transcript. I got curious.
CROCKETT
What about?
Hands.

BENNET

Bennet holds up the victim’s hands alongside Kimble’s hands.
BENNET (CONT’D)
Mr. Kimble’s hands had the victim’s
blood on them. But no bruising, or
bites, or scratches.
(--)
I started to wonder if these two
pairs of hands could have been in
the same fight.
(--)
So my mind went somewhere new.
(--)
If Mr. Kimble’s family had a
history of hemophilia. His father
said no, and medical records
support that. But there is a strain
of hemophilia -- hemophilia A -that is not hereditary, and almost
unheard of, so never tested for. I
couldn’t think of any other
explanation. I ordered the test.
(and)
Mr. Kimble tested positive for
hemophilia A.
Prosecutor again. The humiliation upon him.
BENNET (CONT’D)
If his hands were the murder
weapon, he would have bled
profusely for a long period of
time. He might have even bled to
death.
(and now)
Mr. Kimble’s hands may have touched
the victim, to aid her, as he
claims, but there is no scenario in
which they killed her.

Heavy Nigerian. Weary, perhaps with the time difference.
BENNET

BENNET
Collect knowledge. I need

A clinic requires a physician.
BENNET
I am a physician, papa.

You bury the dead.

I help families understand why

His mother wrapped in loud blazing colors.
Bennet carefully folds a clipping from the Pittsburgh PostGazette: “Saved From Execution”, and a photo of himself.
Slips it into an envelope: “Chief John Donatus Omalu, 90

Breakfast awaits. Local fare from “back there”. Chapati.
Ugali. He stops. Because-The microscope has been moved. From table to counter.

Unclear to him how much he likes any of this.
He eats reading a business school text. Stealing glances at

Bennet’s Mercedes finds a spot on the edges of the media

Where he finds Sullivan and Annie arriving. Sullivan wearing
his “Webster/52” Steelers jersey. Gracie’s wearing Steelers
gold&black strung ribbon through her hair today. In Webster’s
honor. As they converge-BENNET

That brown stuff is tau. It’s a

tangles strangle the neurons from

Think of it like pouring wet

Bennet glancing only at the SOUND of helmets crashing.
Prema studying the game, the strategy. The quarterbacks
scrambling for their lives, slipping from the clutches of

BENNET’S POV/WHAT HE’S SEEING
An ANIMATION OF the deceleration of a football head. Helmet
colliding with a knee. Head halted abruptly. But the brain,
floating in fluid, keeps going, smashing into the inner
skull, as a rubber ball might when smashed by a racquet.
And our animated head - 4-walled - morphs in Bennet’s POV
into the armored and caged head of Mike Webster. He’s bent
over. The other 20 players vanish, and it’s just him and
Bradshaw. Endless repetitions. Hut-snap. Hut-snap. It’s a
kind of clinic. This is how it’s done. The two of them a
single organism, and BAM! And now-It’s game time, and the field is full, the stands are full,
and Webster is nut-cracked between two defensive linemen. And
there’s Webster’s rubber-ball brain boing-boinging off the
skull, skull off helmet, helmet off other helmet. And we

Clock says 4AM. We’re DOLLYING SLOW THROUGH the autopsy
chamber. Silhouettes of fresh bodies on the slabs.
Light spills out of the lab. We follow it to Bennet at a
significantly bigger microscope than he has. Rubbing the back
of his neck.
Prema has put a couple chairs together and is asleep under a
blanket, between Bennet and the corpses. Keeping guard.
Against everything. Her really astounding beauty.
Now TILT UP to Bennet standing over her. Really seeing her
for the first time. Prema stirs. Eyes open huge dark almonds
right up into Bennet’s face. He is clear-headed, suddenly.
As if she’s heard something. Her eyes shift to a cadaver. Its
perfect stillness.

Diving birds hit the sea at 200
MPH, generating 1,000 g-force at

produces a g-force of a thousand.

times over their lifetimes. Bighorned sheep-(DeKosky gives Hamilton an
impatient look)
Bennet--

HAMILTON

BENNET
All these animals have shock
absorbers built into their bodies.
The woodpecker’s tongue comes out
the back of the mouth through the
nostril and goes around the top of
its head. Basically, it’s one big
safety belt for the brain.
(then)
Humans? Not one piece of our
anatomy protects us from those
kinds of collisions. A human being
will get concussed at 80 g’s. The
average head-to-head contact on a

not intend for us to play football.

DEKOSKY
Do you even watch football?
BENNET
Not at all-(back to the board)
But I studied Mike Webster’s
position. The one int he middle.
The most violent on the field. The
slaps and the choking, the head as
a weapon on every play of every
game, of every practice. From the
time he was a boy, then a college
man, through a professional career.
The thousands and thousands of hits
that weren’t concussions.
Now circles the wide-outs, running backs and safeties-BENNET (CONT’D)
But these? They are the fastest.
BENNET (CONT’D)
Their speed multiplied by the speed
of the men who hit them, and the
trajectories at which they hit
them, the g-force created - the
same as getting hit on the head
with a sledgehammer -HAMILTON
Slow down. The brain. Get to the
brain part-BENNET
(distinctly not slowing)
Mike Webster played eighteen years
of professional football. 90thousand blows to the head during
just his professional career, by my
calculation.
(and now--)
All this triggered a cascading
series of neurological events that
unleashed killer protein upon Mike
Webster’s brain. The tangles
invading and then strangling his
mind from the inside out. Leaving
him unrecognizable, even to
himself.

46.
BENNET (CONT'D)
Why it is not the same is
that when a boxer receives
this kind of blow, it is once
in a very long while. Because
he goes down and he often
does not get up, and the
fight is over. It is not over
and over and over every day
of every week, week in week
out, practice or game.

BENNET (CONT’D)
I don’t know the game. I have never
played the game. But I am convinced
playing football killed him.
(and)
And there have to be others.
DEKOSKY
How can you know that?
BENNET
Common sense. But they’re dead. Or
lost. Like Mike Webster was lost.
DEKOSKY
I’m not interested in common sense.
The only thing that interests me is
science, and science is knowing.
BENNET
I know from these men’s records
their doctors think they have early
Alzheimer’s. Which is statistically
impossible. Because it isn’t
Alzheimer’s. It’s this.
Dekosky sits.
DEKOSKY
Holy Christ.
HAMILTON

PELLMAN/TV
From nowhere. Let’s be honest.
Whatever this Omalu wants his
science to say, NFL players are the
biggest, strongest, toughest men in
the world. They have evolved to a
state where their brains are
actually less susceptible to
injury. I actually send veterans
back in more quickly than rookies.
They know how to unscramble their
brains a little faster. A rookie
won't know what's happened to him
and will be a little panicky. The
veterans expect the hits. They want
the hits.
Bennet can’t believe what he just heard, maybe smiles a
little, notes LUNCHERS paying attention to all that. On their
faces: pensive appreciation, agreement. Bennet sobers. Pushes
away his untouched meal. Then-As we start to HEAR a phone RINGING in PRE-LAP, we’re-105

chairman of the neurosurgery

“fallacious reasoning.”
(and looks to the phone,

“To go back and say Long was
depressed from playing in the NFL

Bailes comes out on the porch, waiting for him. Coming from a
distance, we sense in him a hostility held in reserve.
As Bennet stops, reaches for the sleeve of medical slides-BENNET
Is this a good idea?

You tell me.

INT. HOME OFFICE - BAILES’ HOME - DAY
Bennet with Bailes sitting around a work table. Coffee and
sandwiches. Bailes at his microscope. The sleeve of slides
open. Then backs away.
Then goes to his desk. Pulls out a folder of lab reports.
Photos. Illustrations. Graphs.
BAILES
The NFL has known about the
concussion issue for years-CLOSE ON THE REPORTS.
BAILES (CONT’D)
What you’re looking at is the
research that formed the basis for
the League’s concussion guidelines.
In this study, some academics put
helmets on monkeys and shook them
real hard. Threw dogs and pigs and
human cadavers down elevator
shafts.
(picks up another one)
Helmets on crash test dummies and
bashed them together. Conclusion?
(reading--)
“No striking player experienced
neck injury or concussion.”
Concussions are as dangerous as a
hang-nail.
Bennet waits for more, then, disbelief-BENNET
And that was it?
BAILES
No. Then the NFL did what every big
organization does.

Pellman’s Mild Traumatic Brain
Injury committee.
BENNET
Mild - before they knew. Conclusion
first.
(then)
It’s the opposite of science.
(and Bailes looks at him,
Exactly)
BAILES
Know who else is on that committee?
BENNET
Dr. Maroon?
BAILES
Joe, yeah, he’s on there. Plus
other team doctors. An equipment
manager.
(and)
And two trainers - guys who tape
knees for a living.
(then)
I was more interested in studying
actual human football players, who
could talk about their pain.
After a moment.
BENNET
Why did you really want to see me,
Dr. Bailes?
BAILES
Do you have any idea how many
Pittsburgh Steelers - just Steelers
- died in the last few years? I’m
not talking about older guys. I’m
talking about players I knew. And
just the ones I know about.

Overlooking a wide expanse of yard, lawn, pool, designer

Bennet studies Bailes. This is a man in pain. Bennet relaxes-BAILES
I know them. I was them. You’re
doing this wrong.
BENNET
As long as the NFL denies the
truth, nothing changes.
BAILES
(that’s right--)
If they say it’s not true, it’s not
true. They have to say it out loud.
BENNET
I need to look the Commissioner in
the eyes. Get me a meeting. Face-toface, man-to-man. I cannot lose.
Pause. Bailes looks to Bennet. At his innocence. Then-BAILES
He doesn’t want to talk to you.
Football doesn’t want to talk to
you.
(because--)
Like my daddy - a Louisiana judge always said-(holds up two fingers; and,
in an exaggerated
aristocratic southern
drawl)
‘Son, God is number one’(now just one finger)
‘And football is number two’.

You’re not even American. You’re

And if they don’t get this reinedin, everything they have,
everything they are, is vulnerable.
(then)
What’s happening now, what you
think they’re doing to you? Is
nothing. You have no idea how bad
this could get for you.
A long pause.
BENNET
I did my own research on the NFL’s
brain injury committee. You know
what Dr. Elliot Pellman is? He’s a
rheumatologist. He’s a specialist
in arthritis and joint pain. Can
you tell me what a rheumatologist
knows about the brain and brain
disease?
(and)
Corporate men like this, in this
country, come from Harvard and
Yale. But Pellman went to medical
school in Guadalajara.
BAILES
Mexico? I didn’t know that. That’s
beautiful.
And looks at him - “I like you” BAILES (CONT’D)
It’s unlikely I could get you in
front of them. But two cases aren’t
going to be enough. You have to
keep going.
BENNET
Just so you understand. This
doesn’t show up on a CT scan. There
is no diagnosis before death. For
me to keep going more have to die.
BAILES
Unfortunately, I no longer see a

already happening.

I’m going to read you something.

“...There isn’t a day that goes by
that I don’t thank God for blessing
me with you as my mom. Happy

His signing bonus, he bought me
this house. He bought all his

we were planets.
Bennet’s eyes closed, nodding, feeling Andre’s presence.
WATERS’ MOTHER (CONT’D)
After he gave me this card, he
said, “Ma, I’m ready to go.” He
knew people started thinking he was
crazy.
BENNET
Not crazy. He’d already become
someone else-And she looks at him. Her eyes welling up. Anger.
WATERS’ MOTHER
Suicide. He took it out of
God’s hands.

BENNET (CONT'D)

bodies are waiting. As if he’s heard something. He mumbles,
“I’m sorry,” moves closer to the others, gives the angry
corpses room. (We see all this. And Wecht does. Bailes
doesn’t. Because he doesn’t know to.)

I just kept sending him back out

You have to be part of all that.

Tires. Oil. You’re a mechanic

They’ve been sitting for a couple hours. Bailes looks to his

He wanted to do this two hours ago.
And now a reflection in the window turns Bennet. Joe Maroon
is crossing toward them. Hesitates at the table, takes a

This is an important day in the
National Football League. We’ve had
some very good dialogue, which will
help us improve the care for our
players.
REPORTER 1
What do you think when you hear
about former NFL players who are
suffering from symptoms that have
only been seen in boxers or people
over 80-years old? What does that
say about the effect of concussions
on players?
GOODELL
I’m not a doctor here. But you have
to look at their entire medical
history. From my standpoint, not
being a doctor, that just makes
logical sense. You’re seeing some
great scientists and doctors, who
have done terrific work in this
area, sharing information. They
don’t all agree. The NFL has had a
committee of expert doctors and
scientists going on this for 14
years. This is an evolving science
and that’s okay.

While I agree with the
Commissioner, as I was discussing
with other NFL medical personal, no
empirically determined proof was
presented today. Because there
simply isn’t any. The truth is and we will be delivering this
directive to our players - that
current research with professional
athletes has not shown that having
more than one or two concussions
leads to permanent problems, if
each injury is managed properly.
Bennet starts to back away, as-REPORTER 2

Bennet enters amidst the bouquets. “Your friends at the

BENNET
I wish I never met Mike Webster.
PREMA
Your work was beautiful. You are

Splinters. And as he swings-We PULL outside the house, TRACKING IN REVERSE, house
RECEDING IN FRAME, the perfect windows, the perfect yard, the
baby foliage. GLIMPSES of Bennet in the window, swinging at
the guts of the house. Then stopping. Slipping to his knees,
weeping seething with rage-As we keep going back. Rising, PULLING high and far from the
cul-de-sac, the subdivision. Everything in front of us - the

Something seriously wrong with my

And photos of an ex-wife. Children. Parents.
A portrait of himself in a Chicago Bears uniform.

Bennet slips out of bed away from a sleeping Prema. Takes the

BAILES
He shot himself in the chest,
Bennet. In the heart.
BENNET
Oh my god-BAILES
He left a note. He said he was
thinking about all NFL players. He
wanted his brain donated. To be
examined. He said we were right.
BENNET
He said that?
Bennet has gone to stand at a window looking out on his
humble little street.
BAILES
Bennet? You there?
BENNET
For the brain’s last act to not
just die, but preserve itself in
the act of killing, to give an
instruction to shoot into the chest

that.

With a terrace letting out on the Atlantic. A Louis XVI bed.
Murals. A fountain. Bennet left alone to dust off. Standing
in the center of the obscene room-Chooses to iron his suit in his underwear. And shave.
Scraping his face, a tension surfaces. Eyes to hands. PUSH IN
CLOSE on his hands. Blade bowing against his cheek. Until
slicing himself.
He watches in the mirror the blood zag down his face. Then

INT. GRAND BALLROOM - BREAKERS HOTEL
Bennet approaches the podium. And turns to 500 faces. Mostly
players, former players, their families. But there is Jones
and Pellman. NFL lawyers. Team doctors, player reps.
And the wives. We know who they are. Because they’re in their
40’s and 50’s. And because they are alone, no men beside
them. Among them, Keana Strzelczyk. And her kids.
We find Bailes. He nods at Bennet, smallest nod of
accomplishment.
Behind all that, toward the back: Mike Webster. Waiting,
listening with intent.
Bennet takes out his speech. Glances at the pages. Then up at
the audience. At Webster. In the suffocating silence.
He grips and leans into the podium. STARES out there,
weighing the costs of what he’d like to say against what he
might say. Capable now of anything-BENNET
I don’t hate football. My wife has
started watching it. I see the

And now Bennet simply stops and walks off. Every face in the
room turned his way. Here and there people have stood up.
Players. Wives. As he exits.
Not Webster. As Bennet turns for the exit, he spots him
sitting where he sat. We’re SLO-MO. Pulling away but hanging
onto Webster. His hands on knees. Head down. Alone.
As Keana Strzelczyk, behind him, is weeping in silence. Her
children, teenagers, cocooning her in their arms. They’re
letting it go. Letting it all go. Bennet leaves all of them.

* Bennet Omalu turned down the Washington job offer. He
remains in Lodi, California, with Prema and his two children.
* Shortly after Hall of Fame linebacker, Junior Seau, shot
himself in the heart, more than 4,500 retired NFL players
sued the NFL for concealing the dangers of concussions.
* The NFL proposed a settlement in which former NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Dr. Elliot Pellman would
never be questioned under oath, and the League would never
have to disclose what it knew about concussion-related brain
problems, or when it knew it.

* Last September, actuaries hired by the NFL concluded that
33% of all retired professional football players will suffer
“serious cognitive impairment”, including CTE, in their
lifetime.

dropped.
