EXT. ALIA’S COMPOUND - EASTLEIGH - NAIROBI - DAWN

Black. Then the faint glow of hot embers.
ON SCREEN: EASTLEIGH, NAIROBI, KENYA - 06h00
A scraping sound as the door of a small brick oven opens.
FATIMA MO’ALLIM, early 30's, slender, Somali, reaches in and
places loaves of unbaked bread into the wood-fire oven.
A worn blue headscarf - a hijab - is wrapped around her head
to cover her hair but still reveals her beautiful face.
FATIMA runs a small home bakery business within the walls of
the family compound.
The bakery opens onto a sandy courtyard that surrounds a
small rough brick home with a corrugated sheet metal roof and
a separate, small roughly constructed bicycle workshop.
There are bicycles and bits of bicycles everywhere.
FATIMA’S husband, MUSA (30's) sits on a crate amidst the
bicycles he repairs putting the finishing touches onto a home
made “hula hoop” made of black PVC tubing.
His young daughter, ALIA, 10, watches with impatient
excitement as he inserts a plastic connector into the tube to
join the two ends in a hoop.
ALIA
Is it done, Papa?!

ALIA (CONT’D)
Weli ma dhameyn miyaa Aabe?!
(Welli mah dah-main meeyah Ahbe?!)

MUSA
Patience, Alia...

MUSA (CONT’D)
Dulgaado, Alia...
(Dul-gaar-doh, Alia...)

She fidgets with anticipation.
ALIA
Do you like the colors I
used?

ALIA (CONT’D)
Maka heshay kalarka aan
isticmaalayo?
(Maka heh-shay kalarka aan
iss-tih-maa-la-yo?)

The tubing has been decorated with bright twists of
electrical tape that form rings of colorful patterns.
MUSA
Very pretty...

MUSA (CONT’D)
Aad iyo Aad La'Jacleey...
(Aad iyo aad lah-gel-lay...)

Scattered around the yard are half a dozen discarded hoops of
different sizes and colors.
ALIA
This is my best one ever!

ALIA (CONT’D)
Kani waa midka aan weligeyga
Jeelaandoono!
(Kani waa midka aan weli-gayist-ti-male-donno!)

MUSA smiles, and hands her the hoop. ALIA takes it. She
swings it over her body and around her waist - and SPINS it.
She swings her hips, making the hoop swirl around her body.
Look, Mama!

ALIA

ALIA (CONT’D)
Hooyo, Fiiri!
(Hoy-yo Fee-ree!)

FATIMA looks out into the yard at her and smiles.
As ALIA continues to spin the hoop, the CAMERA RISES UP over
her and continues to rise, higher and higher, until we are
seeing:
A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW of the compound within the surrounding
neighbourhood setting.
Their home is in a Somali Militia controlled neighbourhood of
Nairobi. The sun has just risen, but people are already on
the move.
Beyond the safety and privacy of the walled family compound,
militia hang out on street corners and guard unofficial
checkpoint barriers on neighbourhood entrances, making it a
no-go area for the Kenyan police.
Within this no-go area they stop cars and search anyone they
suspect of being a Kenyan security police collaborator.
Four YOUNG MEN drive past Alia’s compound in a pickup truck
with a machine gun bolted on to the back. They set the
neighbourhood tone.
As we rise higher we reveal that the whole area is a rabbitwarren of streets, shops and market stalls.
We FADE IN our TITLE:

Over this we become faintly aware of the low pulse of deep
bass music...

COLONEL KATHERINE POWELL lies awake in bed. Her husband SIMON
sleeps beside her in an eye mask.
ON SCREEN:

SURREY, ENGLAND - 03h15

The thud of music is coming from another room: Quiet, but
loud enough to be irritating once one becomes aware of it.
POWELL has become aware of it and it is now irritating her.
She gets up.

POWELL, in her pyjamas, exits her bedroom, crosses the

INT. POWELL’S GARDEN OFFICE - SURREY - NIGHT

POWELL withdraws a secure dongle from a pocket in her gown
and plugs it into a USB port in a computer on a desk.
Jesse knows the routine: he has a basket in here too and he
lies down in it.
The office is full of military books, files, mementoes and
photographs: her entire military career is in this room - and
we immediately understand that this is where she lives out
her life. The house is just where she sleeps.
While her computer boots up, POWELL glances at a large pin
board on a wall beside her desk:
It is covered in hand-written notes and SURVEILLANCE
PHOTOGRAPHS taken in various foreign locations of WANTED
HVI’s - High Value Individuals.
The faces are mostly Somali, but we also notice a young
British Muslim student named RASHEED HAMUD, and a young
American named MUHAMMAD ABDISALAAM. (Note: It does not matter
whether we know their nationality at this point, but their
dress is clearly western.)
One photograph in particular stands out from the rest:
A WHITE WOMAN wearing a deep blue head scarf (a hijab) which
covers her hair. The name SUSAN HELEN DANFORD appears beneath
the picture, as well as the name “AYESHA AL-HADY.”
Another picture shows Danford without her hijab. She’s an
attractive woman in her early thirties.
In yet another she is with a man named ABDULLAH AL-HADY - who
we will learn is her husband.
Still other pictures of her show her in various foreign
locations. A few copies of different PASSPORTS show her image
with different names: ALLISON WEST, REBECCA SUTTON.
Below the images of Danford and Al-Hady are dozens of other
YOUNG FACES - some Western dressed, some local Somali
fighters with weapons.
Some have been inked out in red.
POWELL stares at the image of Danford for a moment.
Then her computer BLEEPS and she turns to check her in-box.
An email message comes up with A PICTURE OF A YOUNG ARMY
CORPORAL in a wheelchair wearing PROSTHETIC LEGS. We read:

Dear Colonel Powell
The new legs are good. I can walk to the shops, but I don’t
see the point in doing that, or in doing anything.
Captain Kirby has suggested...
She scrolls to the end:
... to be honest, I wish I had died.
Corporal Shane Allen.
Powell sits staring blankly at the picture of the crippled
soldier. She is, for a moment, lost. Then she begins to type
a reply.
Dear Corporal Allen
Do not lose hope. Once you recover, I promise to assist in
reassigning you...
As she types, an INCOMING EMAIL ALERT pops up on her screen.
Subject: “More news on Ben.”
Powell stops writing her reply to the first email.
She hesitates, then opens the new one.
We READ:
This was posted an hour ago.
http://www.al-news.org/watch_now/
Still can’t believe we lost him.
Good luck this morning.
Talk later.

POWELL steels herself. Then reluctantly clicks on the link in
the email.
A NEWS VIDEO CLIP opens.
It shows HAND HELD FOOTAGE of A YOUNG, DEAD, AFRICAN MAN in
plain clothes lying in filth in an alley. He has been shot in
the back of the head. Blood pools around his shoulders.

The VOICE of a REPORTER plays over the footage, which cuts to
various images of Al-Shabaab Militants chanting with weapons
raised, and graphics of the geographical area described.
REPORTER’S VOICE
Somali Al-Shabaab militants have
posted this picture of an unnamed
man they say they have executed in
Nairobi. The group claims he was
working for British military
intelligence attempting to
infiltrate their international
recruitment networks. Al-Shabaab
want to impose their strict version
of Sharia law across the horn of
Africa. They bitterly resent the
role of Britain and the Kenyan
military in propping up the UN
backed Somali government in
Mogadishu. The Ministry of Defense
has declined to comment, but
denounced the execution as
“sickening.”
Affected, but stoic, POWELL watches in icy silence.

A sleeping body is dimly visible with covers over its head.
The clock clicks to 20h45 and the radio comes on: Indie rock.
STEVE WATTS, 25, reluctantly moves the covers aside and flips
on a side lamp.
He lies staring at the ceiling for a moment, listening to his
music, still half asleep, not wanting to get up just yet.
The room is sparsely decorated. On his bedroom wall is a
single, large framed aviation art painting by Randy Green of
“The Boys from Richmond” fighter jets against a striking sky.

POWELL, now in Wellington boots and a weatherproof jacket,
walks with Jesse. There is a weariness about her. A profound
sadness lurking just beneath her tough exterior.
She tosses a stick for her dog. There’s an edge of
aggression, of unexpressed anger in the throw.
Jesse chases it, happy.

JAMES
On behalf of the British
government, I am proud to introduce
Integrated Battlefield Solutions, a
UK company leading the field in the
production of life-saving,
lightweight military clothing.
Protecting our soldiers in the
field of battle is at the core of
my government’s commitment to our
armed forces. Soldier safety first
is why we are in partnership.
IBS director, NIGEL ADLER, beside him, nods vigorously.
JAMES (CONT’D)
And so I am very pleased to
introduce you to IBS managing
director, Mister Nigel Adler.
A ripple of applause from the BRITISH REPS - but most of the
people watching are invited FOREIGN BUYERS and they wait in
silence for ADLER to speak.
Also watching are KATE BARNES (25), PR to the Foreign
Secretary, and TOM BELLAMY (28), his aide.
ADLER
Thank you very much, Foreign
Secretary. We feel extremely
honoured that you have taken time
out of your hectic schedule to open
our stand this afternoon. Thank
you.
JAMES smiles bravely - but he is struggling with what turns
out to be food poisoning.
KATE
(a whisper to Tom)
He’s going to throw up.
TOM
I told him not to eat the prawns.
ADLER
Today we are introducing three new
ranges: the Adamant Assault Body
Armour System, the Personal
Camouflage System and our light,
fast-wicking underclothing range...
JAMES is struggling to keep his insides under control.

Among them is SERGEANT MIKE GLEESON, 28, an OPS WATCHKEEPER
and SERGEANT MUSHTAQ SADDIQ, 27, a targeteer.
They hold permanent positions here and so have a few personal

children’s drawings.
POWELL’S workspace is temporary - so there is nothing
personal here.
There are whiteboards with flip-charts and large TV screens
suspended from the ceiling.
On these screens are various high angled surveillance images
and graphics. We do not focus on any details yet.
SERGEANT MUSHTAQ hands POWELL a report.

A DANCER, “SHELLEY,” approaches STEVE - and gently pushes him
backwards. Steve falls into a chair.
SAMMY (CONT’D)

he looks anything but normal.
He’s relieved to see a driver (DRIVER TWO) holding up a

She puts down her basket of bread, takes out a cloth and
begins to carefully lay it on the rickety table.
SHE HEARS RAISED VOICES - and looks up to see a POOR WOMAN
being questioned by THREE MILITIA MEN about her attire, which
does not cover her wrists.
MILITIA LEADER
You need to cover yourself

Humiliated the WOMAN walks away.

Well, using the Reaper, we have the

LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
Ma’am, she is a member of AlShabaab and number four on our East
African most wanted list...
ANGELA
I don’t care about your “list”
General. I came here to witness a
capture, not a targeted
assassination!
BENSON eyes her coldly. WOODALE looks to GEORGE, the Attorney
General, for advice, putting him on the spot.
George?

WOODALE

GEORGE
Frank, I’m sorry, but I agree with
Angela. The idea was to capture
Danford, not kill her. That is the
mission approved by the P.M. And as
Attorney General, that is what I
came here to witness. We want her
brought back to this country to
stand trial.

COLONEL POWELL
We need to put a Hellfire through

We cut between the two:
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
I told you, they came to witness a
capture, not a kill. Give me a
capture option.
COLONEL POWELL
I no longer have a capture option.
Any action on the ground will lead
to an armed confrontation we will
not be able to contain.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
They’re watching. Even with the
vests, we will need their approval
for a strike.
COLONEL POWELL
Tell them we have Danford in our
sights. That alone should be enough
to justify using the hellfire. The
vests are a bonus.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
Danford is a British citizen. They
want her alive.
COLONEL POWELL
They cannot have her alive. Six
years I’ve tracked her, Frank. We
need to expand our rules of
engagement right now if we want to
protect the civilian population. A

most effective option.

HAROLD
A missile from the Reaper?
Yes.

COLONEL POWELL

HAROLD
So this is no longer a capture
situation?

No. We have two suicide vests with
explosives inside that house. Can
you clear me a higher CDE?
HAROLD looks anxious and needs a moment to think.

YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT

COLONEL POWELL (CONT’D)
This is a time sensitive target. Do
I have authority to strike?
HAROLD
The Rules of Engagement you are
operating under only allow for a
low CDE.
COLONEL POWELL
Yes, and my weapons only invoke a
low CDE. It’s the explosives inside
the house that bring it to a
potentially high CDE.
HAROLD
And since you know the explosives
are there, it is incumbent upon you
to take account of them. I can see
a potential legal objection.
COLONEL POWELL
Jesus, we have two suicide bombers
and three very High Value
Individuals inside that house!
HAROLD
And you want them off your list, I
understand that. But the Rules of
Engagement you are operating under
envisaged a capture not a kill
scenario... I think it would be
wise to refer up.
COLONEL POWELL
Are you telling me that, or just
debating with me?
HAROLD
To refer up? Yes. I am telling you
that. For your own protection. Just
to be on the safe side.

ANGELA
Legally we may be safe, but
politically, we are walking into a
minefield. Especially with an
American citizen involved.
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
Do I have permission, Minister?
They again all turn to WOODALE. He sweats:
WOODALE
Well, given the situation - that it
is a change of mission - that it is
now a missile attack on a British
subject - in fact two British
subjects, and an American, and in a
friendly country - I think it is
right and proper for me to refer up
to the Foreign Secretary.
BENSON can’t believe WOODALE is passing the buck.

With respect, Minister, you have

GEORGE
And the rules of engagement mean
that the Prime Minister has already
approved it - and therefore the
Foreign Secretary’s input should
not be relevant...
WOODALE

No, the point is, I have not been a

MUSHTAQ (CONT’D)
If the men stay in this room - and
this here is the target area - we
would expect a one hundred per cent
mortality rate in the room, an
eighty-five to ninety-five per cent
mortality rate within this area and
anything outside the building this area here in the street - a
sixty-five to seventy-five per cent
rate. That is just the Hellfire. If
we factor in the explosives in the
vests... We are looking at even
more extensive damage - way out to
this area here - but I can’t
accurately estimate that payload.
COLONEL POWELL
But we would be containing that
payload in the vests within those
walls, right? Far less collateral
damage than them going off in a
crowded shopping mall.

Yes... Of course.

LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D)
Go ahead, Colonel.
COLONEL POWELL
Sir, our lawyer says the girl’s
presence has not necessarily
altered the legitimacy of our
operation, but he needs that
confirmed.
POWELL is still keeping an eye on all her screens.
GEORGE
Do we have an assessment of what
might happen to her?
COLONEL POWELL
The targeteer assesses a 65 to 75
percent chance of fatal injury
should we proceed. But he has also
assessed a projected loss of life
of between thirty and eighty men,
women and children if the vests are
detonated in an urban area. It’s a
guess of course. But we should
assume they intend to target a
crowded location.
No one knows quite what to say. On the Beetle screen, ABADE’S

GEORGE (CONT'D)
It is one thing to release a
missile doing everything in one’s
power to minimise collateral
damage: In other words to release
a missile whilst the street is
clear, but in the hope that it
will remain so... It is quite
another thing to release a
missile knowing that this girl
will, at worst, be fatally
injured and, at best, severely
injured. So, I disagree with the
assessment of your lawyer at
Northwood.
Agreed...

I would be uneasy if we did not

Sir, if we wait and they leave, we

COLONEL POWELL
Secretary, this is an ethical
argument we cannot get into at this

ANGELA
Colonel, perhaps you should address
that comment to the little girl
selling her bread! The ethical
argument is precisely what we must
“get into.”
BENSON
Ma’am, I hope the fact that she is
a sweet “little girl” is not
clouding your judgement. Dozens of
other “little girls” lives are at
stake if these men leave.
Before Angela can respond, JACK’S laptop bleeps.
JACK

I’m sorry, a Ms. Jillian Goldman

GOLDMAN’s face comes up on the VTC screen. Her image is on

GOLDMAN
Good afternoon and thank you for
allowing me to comment.
WOODALE
Thank you for joining us.

YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT

12 September 2014

GOLDMAN
Our point of view here at the
White House is that we should
attack this target immediately.
As the military members of your
committee know, we have a points
system that takes into account
collateral damage to deduce what
is, and what is not, a legal
strike. And let me tell you,
categorically, that the existence
of this new circumstance does not
push us beyond a legitimate
military action. We are way off
what we would consider a dispute in
this matter.
GEORGE
Ms. Goldman, we have a somewhat
different approach to the
question of collateral damage...
GOLDMAN
(interrupting)
Sir, you must act NOW. You have two
men about to embark on a suicide
mission; you have number two, four
and five on the President’s East
Africa kill list in your sights and you are putting the whole
operation at risk because of one
collateral damage issue?! I realize
this mission is your call, but
there will be some mighty angry
people here in the White House, and
at the Pentagon, and out there in
the world, if you allow these
people to leave and blow a shopping
mall to kingdom come.
JACK
I’m sorry, we have the Foreign
Secretary wanting to join.

Right... We appreciate your
thoughts, Ms. Goldman. Thank you.
Thank you.

Yes there is, but, conversely, it

releasing the weapon now.
JAMES
Forgive me, I’m not sure that helps
me.
GEORGE
(awkward)
James, given the developing
situation... there is a very
persuasive argument that the
decision to act now could be
construed as legitimate.
JAMES
Is that “Yes”?
GEORGE hesitates. Tense, BENSON steps in:
LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON
Foreign Secretary, there is a
military necessity for acting now.
In our view they will be making a
move from the house at any moment.
JAMES
Gentlemen, what action is being
legally recommended to me?!

WOODALE
(to James, with real

James... My recommendation is that
we do not delay in proceeding with

JAMES still hesitates.
COLONEL POWELL
Sir, if we do not act now we risk
losing the lives of up to eighty
people. Many will be children.
ANGELA
With respect, you can only assume
those deaths - but what is certain
is that, if we do act now, this one

Angela, is it you or me who will be

to explain why we knew of the
attack on a mall that killed eighty
people but chose to do nothing to
stop it?
ANGELA
(quietly, respectfully)
You, James... But frankly...
politically... I’d rather point to
Al-Shabaab as murderers of eighty
people shopping than have to defend
a drone attack by our forces that
kills an innocent child.
A beat. Everyone is wrestling with the dilemma. GEORGE shifts
awkwardly, perhaps persuaded by Angela’s new argument.
GEORGE
James, Angela makes a compelling
point. If Al-Shabaab kill eighty
people, we win the propaganda war.
If we kill one girl, they do.
JAMES
So we don’t do it?

Alia’s table has been blown thirty yards away.
She has been blown over by the force of the blast.
She is bleeding and has internal injuries.
She doesn’t know what has happened or what is going on. She
has entered another world: she knows nothing but an instinct
to try and move away.
She gets up to move but her body - her legs - won’t propel
her, they just won’t go with her.
She keeps trying to crawl forward - but no part of her body
is actually able to achieve it so she rocks forwards and
backwards, going nowhere.
