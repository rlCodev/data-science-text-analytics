OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...
FADE IN:
EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK
The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
water runs down its face and body.
TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:
He is strong.

MIDWIFE

The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.
to the new MOTHER:

He is then gently held out

AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:
... hello.

AMANDA

CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:
YOUNGER MIDWIFE
The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
MIDWIFE
(a beat; then)
She is human.
A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.
Sarek arrives.

MIDWIFE (CONT’D)

The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
a moment, clearly disquieted.

EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]

15B

A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.
A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK

15C

SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
looks at the child -- his child -- and says:
Well done.

SAREK

She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
enough rancor:
Thanks.
He regards her.

AMANDA

Knows he’s in TROUBLE --

SAREK
Your tone suggests disappointment. The
Science Council required my presence for
a session regarding-Don't do that.
here.

AMANDA
You knew I wanted you

The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
clinically:
SAREK
As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
traditionally not present at the moment
of delivery.
AMANDA
Well traditionally, I'm not the one
giving birth.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
I moved here -- to another planet -- to
be with you. I needed you to be with me
today. Holding my hand and telling me
I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
breathing the best I can.

Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:
SAREK
You are correct. I should have been
here. I am sorry.
And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
him. And the two look at the baby.
SAREK (CONT’D)
I had a thought. That we might name the
child after one of our respected early
society-builders. His name was "Spock".
She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.
SAREK (CONT’D)
Your silence does not suggest enormous
enthusiasm.
AMANDA
No... Spock.
(smiles, touches his
face)
... Spock.
She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.
SAREK
The child has your eyes.
She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.
gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

She

AMANDA
... and your ears.
And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
-- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and
OFFICER PITTS:
CAPTAIN ROBAU
-- our sensors haven't made
sense of the anomaly?
-- how far are we from the
Klingon Neutral Zone?

OFFICER PITTS
-- no sir, it looked like a
lightning storm in the middle
of space --- 150,000 kilometers, but the
vessel is not Klingon, Sir,
its registry doesn't match any
recorded profile --

SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:
Report.

CAPTAIN ROBAU

-- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:
FIRST OFFICER
Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.
CAPTAIN ROBAU
Are they transmitting on any
frequency?

FIRST OFFICER
Negative, Captain -- all
communications appear to be
shut down.

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Hail the ship. What's the
closest match on registry?

FIRST OFFICER
Nothing even close, Sir.

Robau moves to Pitts:
Any response?

CAPTAIN ROBAU

OFFICER PITTS
No Sir -- hails met with silence.
CAPTAIN ROBAU
Maybe they're incapable -- any
identifiable damage?
OFFICER PITTS
Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem
confused--

CAPTAIN ROBAU

OFFICER PITTS
-- not only is the ship unregistered -but even its construction materials seem
unrecognizable.
Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA -ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:
CAPTAIN ROBAU
... oh my God...
(to himself, boggled)
A lightning storm... then this...

Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.
Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).
AYEL
Are you familiar with this craft?
Robau regards it.

Then:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Who is your commander?
(silence, then re: Nero)
Is it him?
AYEL
You will speak only to me.
CAPTAIN ROBAU
Then ask your commander what right he has
to attack a Federation vessel.
AYEL
That was hardly an attack. My commander
will easily destroy your ship. If you do
not respond to the question.
Robau considers the hologram again.

I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

Are you familiar with -- or better, know

Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

CLOSE ON a young VULCAN BOY. 11 years old. SPOCK. He's
standing in an abstract space -- IMAGES PROJECTED and HOVERING -questions -- that he's answering as they appear, then disappear:
COMPUTER VOICE

-- Correct. What is the
central assumption of Quantum
Cosmology?
-- Correct. Identify the 20th
century earth composers of the
following musical progression:
-- Correct

SPOCK
-- one-thousand-five-hunderedforty-eight --- everything that can happen
does happen, in equal and
parallel universes --- Paul McCartney and John
Lennon.

And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these
odd spaces -- until we PULL BACK WIDE to reveal a large Vulcan
LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,
where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
mass "mental martial arts" test.
We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND
THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who
gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY

Your score is one-hundred percent.
Congratulations. Spock.
Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.
YOUNG SPOCK
I presume you've prepared new insults for
today.
VULCAN BULLY #1
Your mother lies with many men.
Spock just NODS.

Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.

YOUNG SPOCK
I have no such information.
VULCAN BULLY #2
You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
therefore, have no place in the universe.
YOUNG SPOCK
(swallowing that too)
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
elicit an emotional response from me.
Logic dictates you would cease by now.
VULCAN BULLY #1
Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
don't they?
VULCAN BULLY #2
Perhaps an emotional response requires
physical stimuli.
And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
into one of the bowls. He looks up as:
VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT’D)
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her.
Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable -AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They

VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
ARGUE at a distance down the hall:
AMANDA
-- where I'm from, when
someone hits you, you hit back- how is that not logical?
-- They pick on him -- they
tease him -- every day.
-- I want him to embrace
Vulcan, you know that... but
he has to be himself-- which
means, occasionally, being
human.
-- When Vulcans get disgusted
with each other, they never
just walk away, do they?
-- Well humans do.

SAREK
-- Spock had no reasonable
expectation of being
physically injured --- Which is precisely when
reason must guide his actions
above all.
-- His "humanity" is very the
source of his ostracism.
-- No.

And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns -sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

Emotions run deep within our race. In
many ways, more deeply than in humans.

Never, my son. But you may choose the

feelings... so that they do not control
you.
YOUNG SPOCK
They called you a traitor.
(then)
You suggest that I should be completely
Vulcan... and yet you married a human...
why?
Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.

But he holds steady:

SAREK
As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
observe and understand human behavior.
Marrying your mother... was logical.
(Spock seems disquieted)
Spock. You are fully capable of choosing
your own destiny. The question you are
faced with... is which path you will
take. This is something only you can
decide.

YOUNG KIRK
Where are you going?

Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC -YOUNG KIRK
Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!
George hits it away:
GEORGE JR.
This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.
I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no
idea what he's like when she's not here-d'you hear him talking like he's our
dad?! And that's not even his car you're
washing! That was Dad's car! You know
why you're washing it? Because he's
gonna sell it!
JIM
Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom
when she gets back from Africa.
GEORGE JR.
She's gone for five more months, by then
I'll be in a different system.

You're gonna be okay. You always are.
Always doing everything right -- good
grades and obeying every stupid order...

And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors. Your final record is
flawless. With one exception. I see you
have applied to Starfleet as well.
SPOCK
It was logical to cultivate multiple
options.
SCIENCE MINISTER
Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
A distinction all the more significant
given that you will be its first halfhuman pupil. It is truly remarkable,
Spock. That you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
the Academy.
They all start to rise.

But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life -SPOCK

Everyone STOPS.

I must decline.

Confused looks turn cold:

commitment to honor the Vulcan

At the moment, Father, I can
think of no greater way to
honor our race than to attend
Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

SCIENCE MINISTER
Why did you come before this council
today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
need to rebel?
SPOCK
I came with the intention of enrolling,
as my father wished. However, your
"insight" has convinced me otherwise.
Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
convey is gratitude. Thank you,

Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but

The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semiconscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and
Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.
PIKE
I couldn't believe when the bartender
told me who you are.
KIRK
... and who am I, Captain Pike?
PIKE
Your father's son.
(then, smiles)
For my dissertation, I was assigned the
U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
scenarios.
KIRK
He sure learned his lesson.
PIKE
Depends on how you define winning.
You're here, aren't you?
(off Kirk's look)
That instinct to leap without looking-that was his nature, too. And in my
opinion it's something Starfleet has
lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
overly-disciplined.
(beat)
Those cadets you took on, they'll make
competent officers -- but you can bet
your ass they'll run home to momma the
minute they're looking down the barrel of
a Klingon phaser cannon.
KIRK
-- why are you talking to me?
PIKE
I looked up your file while you were
drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
tests were off the charts-- what is it,
d'you like being the only Genius Level
repeat-offender in the midwest?
KIRK
Maybe I love it.

So your daddy dies... you can settle for

Or do you feel like you're meant for
something better? Something special?

And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absentmindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.
KIRK
Come to think of it, I do want to feel
special. You know what? I'm gonna go
start a book club-PIKE
Enlist in Starfleet.
KIRK
Enlist. You must be way down on your
recruiting quota for the month-PIKE
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
be an officer in four years, have your
own ship in eight.

grabs his jacket, stands -KIRK
We're even, right?

I can go.

PIKE

recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a

approaches:
SHUTTLE PILOT
Waiting for something, Cap?
... No.

PIKE
Guess not.

He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard -PIKE (CONT’D)
Hold her a second...
Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
the clothes on his back.
SHIPYARD WORKER
Nice ride, man.
Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard -Live it up.

KIRK

Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.
Four years?

KIRK (CONT’D)
I'm gonna do it in three.

Pike grins as Kirk passes him.
Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some

MAN'S VOICE
Are you people deaf? I told you I don't

Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:
FLIGHT OFFICER
-- you need to find a seat --- Sir, for your own safety,

MAN

Darlin', with no windows --- I suffer from Aviaphobia,

They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:
MAN

KIRK
I think these things're pretty safe-MAN

I got into a debate with my instructor on
the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
to think that the range of transporting
say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
I could not only beam a bird from one
planet to an adjacent planet in the same
system -- which is no big deal anyway -but if I were so inclined I could
actually do it with a lifeform! So I

Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.
Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly -SPOCK
Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
hereby relinquish my command on the
grounds that I have been... emotionally
compromised. Please note the time and

Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,
I've projected that Nero will travel past
Saturn. If we could drop out of warp
behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
the magnetic distortion from the planet's
rings will make us invisible to Nero's
sensors. We could follow him to Earth by
staying in his blind spot.

Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our

us.

you and Kirk -- that often made the

SPOCK
... it was a test?
SPOCK PRIME
(no: his heart heavy)
I'm in no position to pass judgment...
my actions have robbed you of much. I
could not also deprive you the revelation
of all you can accomplish together... of
a friendship that will define you both in
ways you cannot yet realize.

There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.
SPOCK
How did you persuade him to keep your
secret?
SPOCK PRIME
I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
would ensue should he break his promise.
You lied.
I implied.
