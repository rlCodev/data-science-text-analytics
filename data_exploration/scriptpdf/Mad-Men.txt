TITLE CARD "MAD MEN"

1

Images and sounds from late 1950's and early 60's
advertising: Doctors selling cigarettes. Athletes selling
liquor. Bathing suit models with vacuum cleaners.
And most importantly, proud Dads with their perfect wives and
children driving their cars to some green suburban utopia.
We get a sense of the time and its ideals.

INT. KNICK KNACK BAR

Vinyl upholstery and mirrored walls, but brand new. It's
after work, but the women have their hair done and each man's
tie is pushed to the top of his collar. Highballs and
martinis clink under quiet music and everywhere are the
sights and sounds of smoking.
Alone in a red corner booth is DON DRAPER, early 30's,
handsome, conservative, and despite his third old fashioned,
he is apparently sober. He is doodling on a cocktail napkin.
He crosses something out, puts down his fountain pen, and
taps a cigarette out of a pack of "Lucky Strike".
The BUSBOY, a middle-aged black man, too old for his tight
uniform, approaches.
BUSBOY
Finished, sir?
Yeah.

DON
Got a light?

The busboy pulls out a pack of matches from the back of his
'Old Gold’s' and lights Don's cigarette.

The apartment has a huge glass view of Manhattan and is
decorated in Swedish modern: chrome, teak, and white. In the
center of the room, under a large mobile, is a queen-size bed
on a platform.
Midge walks to her drafting table where she is working.

MIDGE
Well, you're lucky I'm still up

DON
How's it going?
MIDGE
They invented something called
"Grandmother's Day". It ought to
keep me busy drawing puppies for a
few months.
She holds up a few of the greeting cards that she has been
working on.
DON
Can I run a few ideas past you?
Midge smiles and heads to the bar to fix a couple of drinks.
MIDGE
Does that mean what I think it
means? Because I'm familiar with
most of your ideas.
Don starts leafing through his pockets, pulling out napkins.

I have this situation with my

MIDGE

Wow, you really are here to talk.
DON
The Trade Commission is cracking
down on all of our health claims.
MIDGE
I get "Reader's Digest".
(handing him a drink)
This is the same scare you had five
years ago. You dealt with it. I
know I slept easier knowing that
doctors smoke.
DON
But that's the problem. The whole
"safer cigarette" thing is over.
No more doctors, no more
testimonials, no more cough-free,
soothes your t-zone, low-tar, lownicotine, filter-tipped, nothing.
It's over. All that's left is a
crush-proof box and "Four Out of
Five Dead People Smoked Your
Brand."
Don drains his drink. Midge puts on a record. She sits
behind him on the bed, starts rubbing his neck.
MIDGE
Is this the part where I say, "Don
Draper is the greatest ad-man ever
and his big strong brain will find
a way to lead the sheep to the
slaughterhouse"?

Don grabs her hands over his shoulders, pulls her over and

That's a pretty picture.

What's your secret?

Nine different ways to say, "I love

Don is laying on Midge's chest. Midge smokes a cigarette.
Don looks off towards the skyline.
DON
We should get married.
MIDGE
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?
Don sits up and grabs a cigarette off the end table.
DON
I'm serious. You have your own
business and you don't care when I
come over. What size Cadillac do
you take?
Midge lays on the bed completely naked, staring at Don.
MIDGE
You know the rules. I don't make

INT. ELEVATOR

A middle-aged black man mans the controls of the crowded
elevator. Three young execs, KEN, DICK, and HARRY, in
apparently identical suits take off their hats and crowd to
the back of the elevator.
DICK
Twenty-three.
HARRY
Oh, but not right away.
An attractive YOUNG SECRETARY, holding her purse to her
chest, steps on the elevator and turns her back to them. The
three men look her over and nod to each other approvingly.
KEN
(to the operator)
Pal, can you take the long way up?
I’m really enjoying the view here.
The secretary looks down. The operator says nothing. Dick
slouches against the back wall.

DICK
What did you do that for? She'll

KEN
Then she'll know what she's in for.
Besides, you have to let them know
what kind of guy you are. Then
they'll know what kind of girl to

HARRY

I have a feeling we won't be going

KEN
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a boy scout.
They walk past an attractive secretary, HILDY, who stands up
as if to stop them.
HILDY
Excuse me, is he expecting you?

He's not expecting anything.

and on the phone.
PETE

Oh, honey, don't worry, I'll get
home safely. I have an important
appointment right now, so why don't
you go shopping or something? Take
your mother to lunch, tell her it
was my idea.
DICK
(to Ken)
Wow, he's good.
The three guys, Ken, Dick, and Harry, settle into different
places around the office. A few of them light cigarettes.
PETE
(to phone)
It's just a bachelor party. ...
No, I really don't know what they
have planned, but judging from the
creative brainpower around here,
we'll probably end up seeing "My
Fair Lady".
Ken looks offended and takes a card out of his pocket with a
drawing of a stripper, on it is written "The Slipper Room".
He holds it up for Pete.
PETE (CONT'D)
(still on phone)
I'll tell you what. I'll stop by
your place on my way home. Your
mother can check under my
fingernails. ... Of course I love
you. I'm giving up my life to be
with you, aren't I?
He laughs and hangs up the phone and picks up her picture
from his desk.
PETE (CONT'D)
What a great gal. I'll tell you
guys, she stole my heart.

Walking down a wide corridor with open offices on either side
is JOAN, mid-twenties, an incredibly put together office
manager. A half step behind her, carrying a cardboard box
with supplies is PEGGY OLSON, who at 20 seems far younger.
JOAN
Now this is the Executive floor.
It should be organized but it's
not, so you'll find Account
Executives and Creative
Executives, all mixed together.
(laughing)
Please don't ask me the difference.
Great.

PEGGY

JOAN
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,
you can avoid some of the mistakes
I made here.
Ken and Dick pass in the hallway.
DICK
(as he passes)
Hello, Joan.
JOAN
(to Peggy, re: Dick)
Like that one. So, how many trains
did it take you?
PEGGY
Only one, but I got up very early.
JOAN
In a couple of years, with the
right moves, you'll be in the city
with the rest of us. Of course, if
you really make the right moves,
you'll be out in the country and
you won't be going to work at all.
They push through a couple of double doors to another set of
offices with secretarial desks in front of them. Joan points
to an empty desk.

JOAN (CONT'D)
I don't know what your goals are,
but don't over-do it with the
perfume. Keep a fifth of something
in your desk. Mr. Draper drinks
rye. Also, invest in some aspirin,
some band-aids, and a needle and
thread.
Peggy whips out a steno-pad and starts writing.
PEGGY
Rye is Canadian, right?
JOAN
You better find out. He may act
like he wants a secretary, but most
of the time they're looking for
something between a mother and a
waitress. The rest of the time,
well -(confidentially)
Go home, take a paper bag, cut
eyeholes out of it. Put it over
your head, get undressed and look
at yourself in the mirror. Really
evaluate where your strengths and
weaknesses are. And be honest.
Peggy looks up at her, a little stunned.
PEGGY
I always try to be honest.
JOAN
Good for you.
As Peggy places her gleaming stapler on the desk, she stares
at the two button intercom, the rotary telephone, and the
electric typewriter.

Joan starts to head away, then turns back.

Down the hallway comes a slightly disheveled Don Draper
followed by ROGER STERLING, an elegant WASP with an
incredible head of grey hair. Roger is the Sterling in
"Sterling Cooper Advertising".
As they whisk by, Joan straightens up and sticks her chest
out. She motions for Peggy to stand up as well.
JOAN (CONT'D)

white shirts still wrapped from the laundry. He takes one
out and changes into it while they talk.
ROGER
No, if I was worried, I'd ask you
what you have. But I'm not. So
I'm just going to assume that you
have something. Which means you
should be worried.
Don folds down his collar and starts tying his tie.
DON
So you came by because you wanted
to watch me get dressed?

No, I wanted make sure you were

Don drops a couple of Alka-Seltzer into a glass.

Of course, as a doctor, one would

in this situation, it's not going

Peggy winces as he inserts the speculum.

I'll warn you now, I will take you
off this medicine if you abuse it.
Peggy looks towards him but is blinded by the light on his

It's really for your own good, but
the fact is, even in our modern

Don leans back in his chair eyes closed for a moment then
slaps his face to alert himself. He opens a desk drawer,
pulling out a chest exerciser which is just a few springs and
some handles. As he does a small black leather box drops to
the floor, popping open. He puts the exerciser on the desk
and returns the contents to the box-- we see it’s a US ARMY
purple heart medal. He flips the lid closed, “LIEUT. DONALD
FRANCIS DRAPER” in gold on the outside. He regards it a
moment and puts it back in the drawer. He then taps a
cigarette out, lights it and begins to exercise as he smokes.
SALVATORE ROMANO, transparently gay--although in 1960, no one
seems to know it--stands in the doorway with a hand on his
hip like Marlene Dietrich.
SALVATORE
Aw look at you, Gidget. Still
trying to fill out that bikini?
DON
It's worth a try.
Salvatore puts a couple of trace paper sketches on the desk.

Without the medical claims all we

Dr. Guttman, psychology is terrific

Strike". Suggesting our customers

If Greta's research was any good, I

DON
Have a great night, Pete.
Congratulations.
He shakes Pete's hand. Pete simmers and walks away. Don
goes back to his desk and looks through his notes. Peggy
stands next to him.
PEGGY
I heard you were amazing in the
meeting.
DON
Fear really stimulates my
imagination.
PEGGY
I just wanted to thank you for a
great first day. And for, you
know, standing up for me with Mr.
Campbell.
She puts her hand on top of his.
DON
First of all, Peggy, I'm your boss,
not your boyfriend.

And second of all, you let Pete
Campbell go through my trash again,
and you won't be able to get a job
selling sandwiches at Penn Station.
PEGGY

He said he left his fountain pen in

don't think I'm the kind of girl-DON
Of course not... Now go home, put

fresh again tomorrow.
Peggy starts to head out.

Oh, and Peggy, I need you to place

INT. THE SLIPPER ROOM

27

Live jazz sizzles in the background. A buxom blonde STRIPPER
is onstage. She unzips her dress in the back and slowly
shakes it to the floor.
Through the smoke-filled air we see Ken, Dick, Harry,
Salvatore, and Pete sitting at a corner booth. They are
drinking and laughing, but Pete is in no mood to participate.
Ken hands a scantily clad WAITRESS ten dollars.
KEN
(to waitress)
I want to see you here every
fifteen minutes, whether you have
drinks or not.
As she puts the drinks down, she shows them her cleavage.
HARRY
Every five minutes.
The waitress smiles and crosses off.

They all watch her.

DICK
Let's live here.
SALVATORE
(to Pete)
You better do more than look,
tonight.
PETE
You have a girlfriend, Salvatore?
SALVATORE
(proud)
Come on, I'm Italian.
Just then, three beautiful young women in cocktail dresses
and pearls approach the table. WANDA, a brunette with too
much hairspray, sits down next to Pete.
WANDA
Is there some kind of party here?
Pete turns to Ken.
PETE
You shouldn't have.
Pete turns to Ken as the women chat with Salvatore.

DICK

He pressed a button, and they came
out.
The girls squeeze into the booth. CLEO, a red-head with fake
eyelashes, puts her arm around Salvatore and holds a
cigarette to her lips. Salvatore lights it.
CLEO
I hope we're not interrupting
anything.
HARRY
Definitely not.
CAMILLE, a platinum blonde in a Chinese dress squeezes in
between Ken and Harry.

Cleo looks at Salvatore curiously.
Wanda leans over and grabs Pete's hand with the drink in it
and pulls it to her lips. She takes a sip, then reacts like
a little girl.

brusquely pushes him away.

Hey! I said stop it.

Wanda rubs her arm and sits down on the other side of the
table. The waitress comes over. Pete throws some money.
PETE (CONT'D)
Get the girls whatever they want.
Wanda stares at Pete and then links arms with Dick.
WANDA
(to Dick)
So what do you fellows do?
HARRY
You're looking at the finest ad-men
in New York. Hell, the world.

As Wanda throws her head back laughing, we see Pete sullenly
staring off at the stripper. Her bra explodes off of her,
revealing two sequined pasties on her gigantic breasts. As
the applause begins, the spot light blacks out.

INT. ZEBRA LOUNGE - LATER

28

A white-coated OLD WAITER weaves through the more formal,
lounge room of the bar, as well-dressed couples have intimate
drinks by candlelight. He arrives at a booth where Don and
Rachel sit across from each other.
OLD WAITER
For the lady, a special mai-tai.
He puts down a large fruit and umbrella covered glass.
OLD WAITER (CONT'D)
And one whiskey, neat.
Rachel takes a sip through a long straw. She is stunning,
her diamond earrings sparkling in the darkness.
RACHEL
So you're going to ply me with
drinks and convince me what a
terrible mistake I'm making?

RACHEL

DON
I shouldn't have lost my temper,
and I certainly shouldn't have
treated you like anything less than
a client.
RACHEL
Apology accepted.
Don smiles and offers her a cigarette.

She takes one.

DON
So you understand.
RACHEL
Now I do. It was refreshing
really, I mean, actually hearing
all the things I always assumed
people were thinking.
DON
I'm really not as bad as all that.
I was under a lot of pressure.
Another account. It doesn't really
matter.
RACHEL
No, it doesn't.
DON
So without making things worse, can
I ask you a personal question?
RACHEL
Don't you want to get a second
drink in me first?
DON
Why aren't you married?
RACHEL
Are you asking what's wrong with
me?
DON
It's just you're a beautiful,
educated woman.

DON (CONT'D)
Don't you think getting married and
having a family would make you a
lot happier than all the headaches
that go with fighting people like
me?

RACHEL
If I weren't a woman, I would be
allowed to ask you the same
question. And I suppose if I
weren't a woman I wouldn't have to
choose between putting on an apron
and the thrill of making my
father's store what I always
thought it should be.
DON
So that's it? You won't get
married because you think business
is a thrill?
RACHEL
(smiling)
That, and I have never been in
love.
DON
"She won't get married because
she's never been in love." I think
I wrote that. It was to sell
nylons.
RACHEL
For a lot of people, love isn't
just a slogan.
DON
Oh, "love". You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart, where
you can't eat, can't work, so you
run off and get married and make
babies.
He looks at Rachel and smiles.

She doesn't smile back.

DON (CONT'D)
The reason you haven't felt it is
because it doesn't exist. What you
call "love" was invented by guys
like me to sell nylons.
RACHEL
Is that right?

I'm pretty sure about it. You're

world just drops a bunch of rules
on top of you to make you forget
those facts. But I never forget.

I'm living like there's no
tomorrow, because there isn't one.
Rachel just stares at him with a long, forgiving look.

I don't think I realized it until
this moment, but it must be hard

Mr. Draper, I don't know what it is

what it feels like to be out of
place. To be disconnected. To see
the world laid out in front of you
the way other people live it. And
there is something about you that
tells me you know it too.
Don nervously reaches for another cigarette and lights it.
DON
I don't know if that's true.

You want another drink?
RACHEL
No. But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.
She stands up and turns her back to Don.

Pete in his top coat stands in front of an apartment door,
leaning his head against the wall. He is obviously drunk and
knocks on the door.
A young woman, MARJORIE, in a pink housecoat opens the door,
holding a toothbrush.
MARJORIE
We're not buying anything.

Nothing. Sitting in my room

tomorrow.

I'm getting married on Sunday.
PEGGY
I heard that.
PETE
You must think I'm a creep.
PEGGY

Why are you here?
Pete looks down and takes a step toward her. He leans in
very close to her. His lips are almost on her forehead. He
talks over her head.
PETE
I wanted to see you tonight.

his two children.
