INT. MARTA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
MARTA CABRERA wakes with a cry.
Plain, modern, cramped. Marta, in her late twenties, takes
a moment to catch her breath. Opens a window.
EXT. SOUTH BOSTON HOUSING PROJECT - MORNING
A tiny window in a cheap apartment building opens, Marta's
face appears breathing deep.

Alice.

They're talking about murder

throat open she doesn't need

let's be sensitive!

Mom standing yelling, Alice slams the iPad cover closed.
Marta puts her head in her hand. Looks at her mom, who
looks back at her with protective sympathy. Marta starts
laughing at the absurdity of it, but the laugh turns into
crying.
MARTA
Alice you can keep watching your show
it's alright.
ALICE
No, I guessed who did it anyway.

Alice hugs her sister. Marta's phone rings. WALT THROMBEY.

Hi, Walt.

Her face shifts in confusion.

MARTA (cont'd)

EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - LATE MORNING
A long narrow private road leading to the Thrombey estate.
Marta's shitty SUBCOMPACT car buzzes by, towards the house.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
Several cars, including a police cruiser with a few
uniformed officers by it. Marta pulls up. An officer eyes

Thank you.

MARTA

INT. FOYER
Thrombey's eldest daughter Linda opens the door for Marta.
LINDA
How you doing kiddo.
Linda is 60ish, well put together, sharp and steely eyed.
She dresses and speaks with just a little more sharpness
than any situation she's in requires.
Hi Linda.

MARTA
How are you?

LINDA
Ueuh. The funeral helped. I guess.
Just seeing him. I thought you
should have been there. I was out
voted.
Linda's husband Richard walks in, on the phone. Same age as
Linda, gruff and confident, will put his feet up on
anything.
RICHARD (ON PHONE)
I'm not the cop so I don't know.
Alright fine, don't come, get
arrested. Die up your own ass all I
care.
(hangs up)
He's not coming.

RICHARD (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
(to Marta)
Ransom. Little shit. Missed the
funeral.
STATE TROOPER WAGNER, fresh faced in his 30s, pokes his head
in through a door.
TROOPER WAGNER
Excuse me, we're ready for you now,
we'd like to see you one at a time.
LINDA
Alright I'll go first. I'm assuming
this will all be wrapped up before
the memorial tonight.
TROOPER WAGNER
We'll do our best ma'am.
Linda exits with Wagner, leaving Richard and Marta.
So.

RICHARD
How you doing kiddo.

INT. LIBRARY
Mystery and horror memorabilia scattered on the shelves.
Linda sits opposite three men: LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT, in his
30s, in a working suit. Very good at his job. The young
Trooper Wagner stands behind him.
Sitting back behind both of them, almost blending into the
background, is a slight man in a linen suit. Legs and arms
fold sharply, like a paper crane. Silent, listening.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
We are just going to reintroduce
ourselves as a formality, I'm
Detective Lieutenant Elliott, and
this is Trooper Wagner. Now, I'm
going to record, just makes it
easier.
(squints at his phone)
Alright, we're with Linda Drysdale,
nee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's
eldest daughter, in discussing the
events the night of his demise, one
week ago, November 8th.
TROOPER WAGNER
We're sorry for your loss.

6.
LINDA
(dry as chalk)
Thank you that means a lot.
Elliott checks his notes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So we understand that night the
family had gathered to celebrate your
father's eighty fifth birthday.
Yes.

LINDA
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
How was that?
The party?

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Warmly lit, classic rock playing, food laid out. Linda and
Richard mingle happily with the rest of the family (who
we'll meet shortly.)
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Did anyone besides the family show
face?
LINDA (V.O.)
Uh. There was Fran, the
housekeeper. Marta, Harlan's
caregiver, good girl, hard worker.
Family's from Ecuador. And Wanetta Greatnana, Harlan's mom.
At the snack table wearing a dozen coats, a woman who might
be three hundred years old. She pounds down chips and dip
like a machine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
(wow)
His mom? How old is she?
LINDA (V.O.)
We have no idea.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Okay, Your son Ransom, was he there
as well?

7.
LINDA (V.O.)
Yes but he left early.
RANSOM DRYSDALE, roguishly handsome in his early 30s,
breezes out the side door, past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom, are you leaving?
INT. LIBRARY
The strange man in the linen suit taps a piano key, as if
reminding to ask him something.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Right, did all three of you show up
at around the same time?
LINDA
N...o, Richard came early to help the
caterers set up.
She raises a questioning finger to ask about the man but
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Okay and you and your husband Richard
work for a real estate firm in
Boston?
LINDA
(sharp)
It's my company.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(checks notes)
Sorry. Right.
LINDA
I built my business from the ground
up.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just like your dad. You two were very
close?
LINDA
We had our own secret way of
communicating. You had to find that
with dad. You had to find a game to
play with him. And if you did that,
and played by his rules...

8.
CUT TO: Richard in the chair Linda was in, giving his
statement.
RICHARD
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I don't know, do they?
RICHARD
Very much not, don't know why I said
that. But Linda does.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Harlan Thrombey, surrounded by his family, Richard and Linda
flanking him, a birthday cake with candles. All smiles.
RICHARD (V.O.)
Harlan started with a rusty SmithCorona, built himself into one of the
bestselling mystery writers of all
time.
INT. LIBRARY
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Seems like all his kids are self made
overachievers.
Richard makes a "...sure" face.
Sure.

RICHARD
CUT TO:
WALT THROMBEY now sits in the questioning chair. Late 40s,
softly obsequious in a sweater and loafers. His leg is in a
cast.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
For the record, I'm speaking to Walt
Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest
son.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (cont'd)
So you run your father's publishing
company?

9.
WALT
Yeah. It's my - it's our, it's the
family's publishing company, dad
trusts me to run it. 30 languages,
over 80 million copies sold. A real
legacy. You guys fans?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I don't do much fiction -

BIG fan.

TROOPER WAGNER
Big.

TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
His plots, like something like "A
Thousand Knives," with the - I don't
want to spoil it but - the cow and
the shotgun, like where do you come
up with that?
WALT
Dad said the plots just popped into
his head fully formed, that was the
easy part for him TAP from the linen suit man's finger.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You live in town, right? You guys
probably arrived at around the same
time?
Walt looks at Linen suit, thrown.
Uh.

WALT
We all got here around 8.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt laughing and mingling with his nervous wife DONNA.
WALT (V.O.)
My wife Donna, she's my rock.
Richard backs up into Donna, who YELPS in fear and throws
her martini in the air. Richard jumps, but Walt doesn't
even register it.
Jeeesus!

RICHARD
Donna, you alright?

WALT (V.O.)
And my son Jacob, he's sixteen.
politically active.

Very

His angry looking son JACOB, who is always on his phone.
INT. LIBRARY
Quick cuts, each in the chair:
RICHARD
The boy's literally a Nazi
MEG
He's an alt-right troll dipshit
WALT
Kids today, with the internet,
amazing.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So the night went well?
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The exact same moment we saw with Richard and Linda of
Harlan in front of the birthday cake - but now it's Walt,
Donna and Jacob next to Harlan.
WALT (V.O.)
I mean. We're all gutted but I'm
happy we got that night with him. To
be by his side, to think about our
books and what we've accomplished
with them, it's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.
INT. LIBRARY
WALT
Passing the torch.
Cut to: JONI THROMBEY in the chair. A striking woman, tall
and boho chic in chunky jewelry and a flowy dress.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So we are with Joni Thrombey, Harlan
Thrombey's... daughter in law?
JONI
Mm. I was married to his son Neil,
We had one daughter, Meg, and then
Neil passed on fifteen years ago.

11.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And you remained close to the
Thrombeys.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Joni dances with various family members, free and flowing.
JONI (V.O.)
Oh they're my family. I feel
simultaneously freed by and supported
by them, that balance of opposites is
the nugget of Flam.
INT. LIBRARY - PRESENT
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Sorry, the Nugget of?
Flam.

JONI
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ah! Yeah Flam, right, your skin care
company. Sorry.
JONI
I forgive you, yes, it's skin care
but it promotes a total lifestyle.
Self sufficiency with an
acknowledgment of human need. That's
Flam, but it's also Harlan. He got
me and Meg through some tough times.
Meg in the chair.
MEG
Granddad gives my mom a yearly
allowance, and he's never missed
wiring a tuition payment to my
schools. He's a genuinely selfless
man.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You left his party early?
MEG
To see some friends at Smith.

12.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Meg trots out.

Linda, pissed, to Richard so Joni can hear:

LINDA
you know, Dad's paying for her

feminist poetry theory whatever
major, she could have stuck around
for the cake.
INT. LIBRARY
JONI
I think Linda was upset.
understood.

But Harlan

Tap.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Right. You two arrived together to
the party at the same time?
Joni looks at the linen suit man.
JONI
If I could - pause - because I, who
is that guy? And why are we doing
all this? Again?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just some follow up questions, just
being thorough, in order to determine
the manner of death.
Cut back to Walt in the chair.
WALT
(almost laughing)
So by "manner of death" you mean if
he was killed. If one of us killed
him. One of his family?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
None of us think that, this is pro
forma, all of it.
CUT TO:

Richard in the chair.
Ok.

He doesn't buy it.

RICHARD
So who the fuck is that?

13.
He points at linen suit.

Elliott takes a breath.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
This is Benoit Blanc.
RICHARD
(the hell?)
Benoit Blanc?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private
investigator of great renown.
Joni in the chair.
JONI
Wait a minute - I read a tweet about
a New Yorker article about you. The
last of the gentlemen sleuths? You
solved that case with the tennis
champ - you're famous!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Blanc is not with the police
department, he is not officially
involved with the case but he has
offered to consult. I happily obliged
and I can vouch for him.
Linda in the chair.
LINDA
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are, I
read your New Yorker profile. It was
delightful. I just buried my eighty
five year old father who committed
suicide. Why are you here?
Elliott and Wagner turn back to Blanc, who leans forward
slightly and speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have
ever heard in your life.
BLANC
I am here at the behest of a client.
Who?

LINDA
BLANC
I cannot say, but let me assure you
this: my presence will be
ornamental.

Fine.

She

RICHARD
Are we getting there?

BLANC
Nearly. Harlan's nurse. She was at
the party in a professional capacity?
Blanc begins idly playing with a silver dollar.
Marta?

RICHARD

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family is engaged in an animated discussion, Marta
standing on the outskirts.
RICHARD (V.O.)
I guess. Harlan hired her to be
around, take care of whatever medical
needs pop up, but really she's like
part of the family.
Richard beckons with his cake, calls Marta into the
discussion, into the circle of the family.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
Good kid, been a good friend to
Harlan. Her family's from Paraguay.
Linda really likes her work ethic.
INT. LIBRARY
RICHARD
"Immigrants - we get the job done."
From Hamilton.
Wagner gives him a smile to show he got the reference.
Oh Hamilton!

TROOPER WAGNER
RICHARD
I saw it at the public.

15.
Cut to Linda back in the chair.
BLANC
May I just - and then I'll recede,
but as a self made man myself I have
to express my admiration for how
you've followed in your father's
footsteps.
Thank you.

LINDA
BLANC
Just marvelous. The whole family too.
Joni with her things, Walt with his
publishing empire.
Well.
Blanc pauses.

LINDA
Doesn't push anything.

Just waits a moment.

LINDA (cont'd)
Yes. I mean. Walt, yeah. He's done
well with what dad's given him.
Walt - not like it matters but he was
sort of adrift, dad gave him the job,
but really dad hands him a book twice
a year and Walt publishes it, I
mean... it's just not the same.
BLANC
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising, adaptations, film and
television rights...
Linda squints, narrowing her eyes on Blanc.

Softly:

LINDA
Are you baiting me, Detective? You
know he doesn't, and you think I'm
dumb enough to be baited into talking
family business, into shit talking my
brother in front of a police
detective and a state trooper Richard in the chair.
RICHARD
Walt doesn't run shit! There are no
film or TV rights, Harlan's never
allowed any adaptations of his books.
Hates the idea.

16.

No!

BLANC
RICHARD
Oh yeah! Drives Walt nuts, cause
that's where the real money's at.
When he gets a little Irish courage
in him he'll get into it with Harlan.
BLANC
Did he get "into it" at the party?
Oh my god.

RICHARD

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt with a drink in his hand has cornered Harlan. Richard
watches across the room as Walt goes from arguing to
pleading.
RICHARD (V.O.)
He wouldn't leave him alone, poor
guy. Harlan had to give him the
hook.
Harlan has had enough, he takes Walt's arm and leads him
into the drawing room for a private talk.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
I didn't hear what he said but he
must have really handed him his
lunch, Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.
INT. LIBRARY
Walt in the chair, indignant.
WALT
What? Richard said what?
Jesus. No, we didn't get
"into it."

BLANC
I'm just trying to get an
accurate impression - Harlan
took you aside at the party,
when you returned you were
chastened, what did Harlan
say to you?

Walt starts to open his mouth, hesitates.

going to last and you should

HARLAN

Walt.
Walt.

WALT
Dad you put me in charge of our books
let me be in charge, let me do this!
Please.
HARLAN
They're not our books, son. They're
my books. And this is not how I
wanted to have this conversation but,
you're right, it's unfair of me to
keep you tethered to something that
isn't yours to control.
What?

WALT
HARLAN
I've done you a grave disservice all
these years, I've kept you from
building something of your own,
that's yours. You're not going to
run the publishing house anymore. You
are free of it.
Dad.

WALT
Are you firing me?

HARLAN
We'll talk about details tomorrow.
But my mind's made up. Good boy.
Harlan pats his face, then leaves him shell shocked.

The briefest of moments has

WALT
We talked, we had a business
discussion, about e-books, Jesus, it
was nothing. You want to talk about
an argument, hell Ransom had an
argument with him.
BLANC
Ransom, Richard and Linda's son?
WALT
Look we love Ransom, he is a good
kid, we love him.
...but

BLANC
WALT
But he's always been the black sheep
of the family, and I'm not, I, I keep
stuff like this in the family, but
with Ransom, he's never had a job.
But dad for some unknown reason has
always supported him, they've got
this love hate bond. They fight.
But that night, god. They had a blow
out.
About what?

BLANC

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family having a conversation, everyone but Harlan, Jacob
and Ransom. It grinds to a halt as through the door to
Harlan's study indistinct shouting booms.
WALT (V.O.)
We couldn't make it out, but it was
huge. And it was strange they went
in another room to do it - they
usually love stoking up drama in
front of the whole family.
Ransom bursts out of the doors and storms out of the party,
past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom are you leaving?

INT. LIBRARY
Richard in the chair.
BLANC
Speaking of getting into it, you were
at the house early to help the
caterer set up. Did you converse
with Harlan at that time?
RICHARD
He was there, we must have spoke.
BLANC
In his study?
RICHARD
I don't think so.
BLANC
You see, I spoke with the caterer
this morning. She didn't see you
helping her staff, but she did hear
Harlan in a screaming match with
someone that afternoon. In his study.
RICHARD
I don't, a screaming match? No.
Joni was here too, she was early,
maybe it was her, ask her.
BLANC
These were two male voices.

For a just a split second, Richard considers what he is
going to say. In the second, we FLASH BACK:
INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan showing Richard photos on a laptop. Long lens
photos, of Richard kissing a woman who is not Linda.
Richard glares at it, Harlan turns an old baseball over in
his hands.
RICHARD
That's none of your business, Harlan.
Stay out of my marriage.
Harlan holds up a sealed small envelope with flowery
embroidery, "L" written on the front.
HARLAN
I know my daughter. She'd want to
know. I've put it all in this letter
to her, tomorrow she gets it.
RICHARD
I'm warning you once, don't
do this like hell -

HARLAN
She deserves to know, you're
going to tell her!

Harlan slams the baseball down on the desk.
HARLAN (cont'd)
You tell her or I will!
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Richard.

He grins, snaps his fingers.

RICHARD
Yes. I know - yes, ha. So. Harlan
decided to finally put his mom in a
nursing home. Which Linda always
opposed. And I was going to wait
till we were back home in Boston to
tell her, so there wouldn't be a
whole scene, but Harlan wanted me to
tell her then. That was it. Sorry.
Forgot.

She's about to

BLANC
What were you seeing Harlan about?
JONI
It was just a mix up with the payment
for Meg's tuition.
BLANC
I'm sorry to press, what kind of mix
up?
Joni hesitates, we FLASH BACK:
INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan at his desk, toying with the same old baseball. This
is a thing he does at his desk. Joni standing, arms crossed.
JONI
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it
HARLAN
Alan didn't mail it because he caught
a discrepancy. Alan's office has
been wiring tuition directly to the
school, as per your request. But
Phyllis's office that handles your
yearly allowance has been wiring the
tuition money directly to you as
well. As per your request. You've
been double dipping Meg's tuition,
stealing from me. A hundred thousand
dollars a year. For the past four
years.

22.
Harlan shows Joni a letter from his business manager, with
transaction receipts attached.
JONI
Harlan. I don't know how this mix up
happened but
Harlan opens his ledger, hand writes a check.
HARLAN
I'm writing this tuition check, then
that is the last money you or Meg
will get from me.
JONI
Please you don't understand
HARLAN
I know it'll hurt but it's for the
best.
Joni's speechless, her face frozen. Harlan puts the
baseball down and detaches the check, holds it out to her.
HARLAN (cont'd)
My mind's made up.
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Joni.

She shakes her head.
JONI
Just a money wiring issue. With the
office at the school. So I had to
ask Harlan to cut a check for this
semester. No big deal.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Why don't we take a breather.

Joni comes out into the foyer from the library, obviously
rattled. She pulls it together quick when Linda comes down

LINDA (O.S.)
Richard!
Alone, Richard waits very still for Linda's footsteps to
walk away, then when he knows she's not coming in he
furtively rifles through desk drawers, finding various
ridiculous ephemera. He finds a small locked drawer,
jimmies it open with a letter opener.
Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him with
in his flashback. He rips it open, pulls out the card
inside.
It is blank.
Richard almost laughs.

Drops it onto the desk.

Son of a bitch.

EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
Blanc, Elliott and Wagner stroll long the wide lawn beside
the house. Blanc ignites a long thin cigar.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Maybe I'm a victim of my own
expectations. But when the great
Benoit Blanc knocks on my door, I
expect it's going to be for
something... if not extraordinary,
at least interesting. This is an
open and shut case of suicide.

Marta sits alone, across from a portrait of Harlan. Muffled
voices out on the patio. Cigar smoke drifts by outside.
She creeps over to the glass door.

Puts her ear to it.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.)
You ask me to drag all these good
people back for questioning, go over
it all again, I don't get it. This
is a pleasant family with the usual
quarrels but no possible motives for
murder - where are you going?
At that moment, BLANC's face appears right next to Marta's
staring right at her through the distorted glass. She yelps
and falls back.
EXT. PATIO
Blanc opens the glass door. Marta steps back sheepishly,
but with a warm nod Blanc beckons for her to join them.
BLANC
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...
...Cabrera

MARTA
BLANC
Marta Cabrera.
TROOPER WAGNER
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait
inside - we'll be with you soon.
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, I been doing a little
poking, you're hired on a part time
basis as a registered nurse, yes?

25.
MARTA
Yeah, I don't work for a VNA.
hired me directly.

Harlan

BLANC
You're paid a flat rate for how many
hours a week?
MARTA
I started at 15, but slowly he...
needed more help.
BLANC
Medical help?
MARTA
He needed a friend.
Blanc smiles at the girl, genuinely touched.
BLANC
Does having a kind heart make you a
good nurse?
Blanc.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
BLANC
Yes. Marta we were just discussing
possible motives in the family. I
suspect Harlan has told you much
unfiltered truth about each of them,
and a little bird has told me, how
shall I put this delicately? You have
a regurgitive reaction to
mistruthin'.
MARTA
Who told you that?
Is it true?

BLANC
MARTA
Yes. It's something that I have had
as a kid. It's a physically thing
that I - I - Just the thought of
lying, yeah, it makes me puke.
BLANC
Really? Is Richard having an affair?
Marta is stunned.

She FLASHES BACK TO:

26.
EXT. PATIO - DAY - FLASHBACK
She reads, Harlan sits at his laptop, heavy with sadness.
HARLAN
Why do men instinctively pull at
loose threads on their parachutes?
MARTA
What?
Harlan spins his laptop towards her - the Richard photos.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Back to our scene.

Marta looks queasy, tries to stall.

MARTA
Heh - Richard? - affair?

Heh.

BLANC
A yes or no will do.
She struggles, her jaw clenched, face working hard, then
attempts .....no

MARTA
And immediately VOMITS into a nearby planter.
Whoa!

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT

TROOPER WAGNER
Oh my god!

They all rush to her, Blanc brings water, awfully concerned.
BLANC
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
were speaking figuratively.
Blanc takes the shortest acceptable beat of concern before
turning to Elliott.
BLANC (cont'd)
Quite something. But I was obviously
right, Richard is having an affair,
his father in law found out and
confronted him. "You tell her. Or I
will."
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Even if it's true... you ok?

27.
Marta gives a weak thumbs up, recovering
ELLIOTT
Even if that was right, protecting
his marriage is weak sauce as a
motive.
Well.
Joni?

BLANC
And then there is... Joni.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Joni?!

TROOPER WAGNER

TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
Lifestyle guru Joni? No. Harlan was
supporting her and her daughter, she
had the opposite of a motive.
Marta tries to quietly slip back into the house
BLANC
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please
MARTA
I'm just going to go get some Scope
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, was Harlan planning on
cutting off Joni's allowance?
Off Marta's "oh god no" face:
INT. STUDY - DAY - FLASHBACK
Harlan looking at the letter from his business manager, with
the transaction receipts. He sighs heavily.
Oh, Joni.
What's up?

HARLAN
MARTA
He hands her the letter.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Marta's face works against impending nausea.

28.

I...

MARTA
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ok don't answer that if you're going
to puke. Please.
But Blanc presses.
BLANC
Meg said Harlan pays the school
directly, Joni says he sends the
money to her. Both were true, she
was pocketing the double payment,
Harlan found out and cut her off
without a cent. Yes?
Marta starts to shake her head no, but her throat convulses.
She nods. Blanc hands her a glass of water.
TROOPER WAGNER
And she bumps him off for the
inheritance? Come. On! Have you
seen her insta? She's an influencer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
An allowance as a motive, Blanc. She
has her business. More weak sauce.
Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck.
BLANC
Granted. But she lied.
three of them did.
Three?
Walter.

To me.

All

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
BLANC
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I see where you are going with this.
BLANC
But there was something else. Harlan
had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights, but that night
something Harlan said shook him. We
look at the pattern, Harlan was
cleaning house. I wonder...
(to Marta)
did he plan to fire Walter?

29.
MARTA
(honest & relieved)
Can I wait inside? I don't feel like
I should be here.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes, please just wait inside but stay
close.
She steps back in, grateful.

Blanc to Elliott:

BLANC
You've been very patient my friend,
and you are right, none of these weak
alibis and domestic squibbles answer
your question: why is Benoit Blanc
here? But now I will tell you why.
(beat)
I am here because this morning
someone dodged one very important
question.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Who?
Me.

BLANC
Linda asked who hired me.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So who hired you?
BLANC
I. Do. Not. Know. An envelope of
cash showed up at my apartment
yesterday, with the news clipping of
Thrombey's death.
An envelope?

TROOPER WAGNER
That worked?

BLANC
An envelope of cash.
Blanc indicates with his fingers - several inches thick.
BLANC (cont'd)
So somebody suspects foul play, but
goes through this ha cha dance of
hiring me, of staying anonymous. It
makes no damn sense. Compels me
though.
(MORE)

30.
BLANC (cont'd)
(beat)
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.
Elliott hesitates, but Blanc's got him hooked. He flips
open his notebook. Blanc leans back, closes his eyes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
We know, the party broke up at 11:30.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Marta and Harlan vanish up the stairs towards the third
floor, while Richard and Linda head into the bedroom right
next to the stairs. Down the hallway Joni waves, and ducks
into another bedroom.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Marta took Harlan upstairs to give
him his meds, Richard and Linda and
Joni went right to bed. Now we do
have this: the stairs leading up to
Harlan's bedroom and his attic office
creak horribly.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Richard sleeps deep, Linda sleeps lightly.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
And Linda is a light sleeper. So we
know every time someone took the
stairs that night.
INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni has decorated the room with colorful silks and candles.
She is in lotus position on her bed, meditating.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
The first was when Joni heard a kaTHUNK from somewhere above her in the
house.
Ka-THUNK!

Joni looks up at the ceiling.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni trots down the hall and up the creaky stairs.

31.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
She's concerned about Harlan, she
went up to investigate. Waking
Linda.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
CREAK CREAK CREAK! From outside.

Linda's eyes pop open.

INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni knocks on the door of Harlan's attic office. It opens,
and Harlan answers. In the room behind him we see Marta,
her back turned, preparing a hypo needle.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Harlan was in his attic office with
Marta. He explained that they had
just knocked the GO board over - that
game with the grid and stones, they
play it every night, and he was fine,
go to bed. So she does.
The spilled GO board on the floor. Joni kisses Harlan on
the cheek, goes. He shuts the door.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Linda has just gotten back to sleep.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Ten minutes later, Linda is woken a
second time, by Marta leaving.
CREAK CREAK CREAK!
Walt!

Linda wakes, supremely annoyed.
MARTA (O.S.)
I'm leaving!

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt and Jacob sit on the porch, Walt with a cigar, Jacob
with his phone. Marta trots through, saying goodbye.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Walt was smoking a cigar on the porch
with his son. He saw her leave and
drive off, and noted the time midnight.

32.
Walt glances at his watch.

Midnight.

INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Linda with a pillow over her head.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Fifteen minutes later, Linda is woken
for the third and final time. By
someone coming down the stairs.
CREAK CREAK CREAK! Linda wakes. You've gotta be kidding me.
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt, still smoking with Jacob, spots Harlan through the
glazed glass, coming down the stairs in the foyer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Harlan. Who came down for midnight
snacks, which Walt tried to
discourage.
WALT
Dad, go to bed!
Through the glazed glass, Harlan goes back up the stairs.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Based on this, the medical examiner
determined time of death to be
between 12:15 and 2am. As Walt was
finishing his cigar, about 12:30, Meg
came home. She went straight to bed.
Walt and Jacob turned in shortly
after that.
Meg pulls up, trots past Walt and Jacob and inside.
INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Meg stirs, wakes.

Joni is asleep.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Sometime later that night,
undetermined but possibly near 3am,
Meg woke up because the dogs were
barking outside. She used the
bathroom and went back to bed.

33.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Elliott snaps the notebook closed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And that's it. Everyone's stories
matched, every movement accounted
for.
BLANC
There is no other staircase up to
Harlan's room?
Blanc scratches that same spot on the side of his neck.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just the creaky one.

No.

Blanc seems intrigued by this.
Interesting.

BLANC
TROOPER WAGNER
So I guess we can rule out Ransom, he
wasn't there. And Marta, Harlan was
alive after she left. But Meg got
home during the time of death window.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Except it was a suicide. Harlan hit
both carotids, we saw from the blood
blood splat patterns that they were
uninterrupted. Meaning, It's almost
impossible for anyone to have been
around him at the time. He's the one
that cut his own throat. I don't know
why we keep going over this.
BLANC
Physical evidence can tell a clear
story with a forked tongue.
What?

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
BLANC
And as we've seen this morning,
everyone can lie. Well. Almost
everyone.

34.
INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Marta in the chair.

She shifts, uncomfortable.

Blanc, Elliott and Wagner in their normal places.
BLANC
Ms. Cabrera, we've kept you waiting
all afternoon because I wanted to
hear from you last. I wanted to have
the entire picture of the evening in
my head. Your piece of it is at its
very center. So please, take your
time. You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs
at 11:30. And left at midnight.
Think very carefully. And with as
much detail as possible, tell us what
happened in that half hour.
Marta is very still. A moment of silence.
silver dollar into the air.

Blanc flips his

She does not say a word, but in that moment while the coin
hangs in the air we FLASH BACK with her to:
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
The night of the party. A clock on a nightstand: 11:32.
Off screen we hear Marta leading Harlan up the creaky
stairs.
MARTA
Up up up up - you got it?

I got it.

HARLAN
Up up up I got

Marta enters the room, and behind her we see Harlan keep
climbing up the narrow stairs to his office.
MARTA
Up up nooooo no not tonight, no
straight to bed tonight it is soooo
late c'mon. Harlan. Harlan!
She grabs a med kit from the bedroom and follows him,
exasperated.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Harlan sits, setting up a GO board.

Marta enters.

35.
MARTA
It's late, I had champagne
no no no

HARLAN
It's my birthday, we are You had one glass - we're
not breaking tradition on my
birthday.

Marta puts two vials and a pill box on the GO board.
pulls out two plastic wrapped hypodermics.

She

MARTA
Take your goddamn medicine and go to
bed.
HARLAN
If you're going to put that vile shit
in me you will have to earn it. On
my birthday.
(playing it up)
Eighty fifth. So old. Soo olddd
MARTA
Alright old man. 8x8 game. You
ready?
She sits and they start clacking white and black stones on
the board.
HARLAN
Why can't I beat you at this
game?
Oh uh huh.

MARTA
Because I'm not playing to
beat you, I'm playing to
build a beautiful pattern.

They play fast, and Marta is obviously winning.
Elder abuse.

HARLAN
I'm calling the AARP.

MARTA
Don't make me get the belt.
HARLAN
It's basically over. My only hope is
that an earthquake will strike. But
what are the chances Harlan starts shaking the table with his knee. He looks
around, startled. Marta just stares at him, deadpan.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Get under a door frame!

36.
He tips the whole table and the GO board and med vials and
syringe and med kit fall to the soft rug. Things spill out
of the kit. A mess. Marta just shakes her head.
MARTA
Meds then beds.
Fair.

HARLAN
She retrieves the vials and loads a syringe from one of
them. Harlan rolls up his sleeve revealing a pre-inserted
catheter. He crosses to close the room's only small window.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Ugh, Walt's smoking a cigar on the
porch. Nasty things.
MARTA
How was tonight?
She hooks the syringe up to the catheter and slowly injects
him bit by bit while he talks.
HARLAN
Tonight was... good.
MARTA
Because I know you weren't looking
forward to it.
HARLAN
No. But I did it. Cut the line on
all four of them. It was not easy.
This goddamn fortune. Sometimes I
think, everything I've given my
family, I've done, maybe without
knowing it, maybe, to keep them
beneath me. I should have what...
maybe, I don't know. Encouraged Walt
to write his own stories, not just be
a caretaker of mine. Like you said I
should. Been a father, not just a
provider, to Joni. Like you've also
said. I should have been kinder to
Linda. And Ransom.
Harlan takes a curved ornamental dagger from a display
mount, turns it over in his hands.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Jesus there's so much me in that kid.
Confident, stupid, I dunno.
(MORE)

37.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Protected. Playing life like a game
without consequence, till you can't
tell the difference between a stage
prop and a real knife.
He stabs it into the desk, sharp and real.

Leaves it there.

HARLAN (cont'd)
I don't fear death. But god I'd like
to fix some of this before I go.
Close the book with a flourish. I
guess we'll see.
MARTA
I guess we will. Hey. Old man.
You've had a long day. Wanna do
drugs.
She loads the second syringe from the second vial.
HARLAN
you mean the good stuff?
MARTA
Yeah but just a tiny bit.
HARLAN
Send me to lala land. Why did I wait
till my mid eighties to become a
morphine user, what a schmuck, what a
nud-nig, this stuff's the best.
She pulls the needle from the second vial... then sees the
label. Freezes. Blinks at it.
Oh my god.

MARTA
She snatches up the first vial she just injected him from.
Compares the label to the one she just picked up. They're
similar but not the same.
HARLAN
Is there a problem?
MARTA
This is what I just gave you 100
milligrams of. But I messed up.
HARLAN
You gave me 100 milligrams of the
good stuff.

38.
She immediately pulls an EMERGENCY KIT from a nearby shelf,
starts calmly but quickly going through its contents.
HARLAN (cont'd)
What's the good stuff dosage supposed
to be?
MARTA
Lets not call it that right now three milligrams.
HARLAN
That's much less. So what happens?
MARTA
I give you an emergency shot of
Naloxone, so that you don't die in
ten minutes.
HARLAN
Well no pressure. You know that's an
interesting, efficient method for
murder, I need to write that down.
He gets a little notebook and scribbles while she checks and
rechecks the kit contents with increasing urgency.
HARLAN (cont'd)
So if someone switched the meds on
purpose I'd be dead in ten minutes,
like stone cold dead?
MARTA
You'll feel symptoms in five. Sweats,
disorientation. Then yeah, that big
a dose, injected, within ten your
respiratory - your - yes ten minutes.
HARLAN
From the time of injection, so
eightish now. And even if the victim
called an ambulance when he first
felt symptoms, if he was at a country
home like this one... where the
ambulance takes fifteen minutes to
arrive, it would be too late. If the
victim didn't have this emergency
Naxostuff.
He watches her. She's now digging around the carpet,
looking under the couch. She dumps the entire contents of
the kit out and is now frantically going through it. A bead
of sweat rolls down Harlan's brow.

39.

Marta.

HARLAN (cont'd)
Do you have Naxostuff?

MARTA
Yes! Naloxone yes it comes with the
emergency kit - it should be here,
it's - fuck. No Harlan it's not
here. It's not. Oh my god.
They look at each other for a second.

She's panicked.

He's

MARTA (cont'd)
Where's my phone? Shit She picks up a landline phone on the table, dials 911 with
shaking hands Before it can even ring, the line goes dead.
She looks, unbelieving: Harlan's finger is on the cradle.
His eyes are locked with hers, serious and certain.
MARTA (cont'd)
Harlan what are you doing?
HARLAN
Marta, listen to me.
MARTA
Harlan we need to - are you
crazy, we need to call, they
need to get here I need to -

HARLAN
Stop. Stop stop, Marta
listen there isn't time stop
now stop

She goes for her cell phone across the room and Harlan stops
her - they trip and fall to the ground with a KA-THUNK.
MARTA
What are you doing are you
nuts?

HARLAN
Marta it's too late it is
over, it's too late I am
dead listen. LISTEN.

He actually puts his hand over her mouth.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Listen. If what you said is true I
am gone, there's no saving me, we
have six minutes. There is one last
thing I need to do in this world, and
only you can help me do it. But you
need to trust me and do everything I
say.

40.
MARTA
What do you want to do?
HARLAN
Get you out of this. Think of your
mom - please trust me, we have to
make this look ironclad like it can't
have been your fault. You. Can't.
Have done this.
My mom...?

MARTA
CREAK on the stairs outside.
Get up.

HARLAN
A knock on the door.
Harlan?

JONI (O.S.)
Marta? Everything alright?

Harlan and Marta stand. She's dazed, deer in the
headlights, but he's focused and sharp. He turns her away
from the door.
HARLAN
Stand here, keep your back to me,
don't say a word.
Harlan opens the door. While he gets rid of Joni we stick
with Marta, who stands stock still, tears running down her
face, eyes wild - what does she do?
Joni.

HARLAN (cont'd)
JONI
I - hi - I heard something, is
everything ok?
HARLAN
Oh yes we just, I just knocked over
the GO board, sorry about that.
JONI
Everything's alright?
HARLAN
Yes yes all fine, go to bed Joni.

41.
JONI
Ok. And maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the, uh, the thing with
HARLAN
Tomorrow.

Yes.

Love you,

JONI
Night.

Night night.

HARLAN
Harlan shuts the door. Looks at the knife still sticking in
the desk. Then takes Marta's shoulders, looks in her eyes.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Pay attention now, your mom is still
undocumented, if this is your fault
she'll be found out and at best
deported, your family will be broken.
A new kind of fear in Marta's eyes.
Oh god

MARTA

She's terrified.

HARLAN
But we're not going to let
that happen. I have a plan,
it's not going to be easy
but you have to do exactly
what I tell you. Will you
do this Marta? This last
thing. For me, and for your
family.
But she nods.

MARTA
What do you want me to do?
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Walt smoking and Jacob.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
say goodbye loudly.
Walt!

MARTA (O.S.)
I'm leaving!

Marta exits quickly, down to her car.

42.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Call attention to the time if you
can.
MARTA
God it's midnight already.
Walt checks his watch.
INT. MARTA'S CAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
She drives out the guard gate and down the private road.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive out the gate, then to avoid the
security cameras, pull off the road
BEFORE the carved elephant.
Up ahead - a weathered wood carved elephant statue.
MARTA
Wait... was it before or after?
HARLAN (V.O.)
AFTER the carved elephant.
MARTA
No, he said - before?

Was it?

HARLAN (V.O.)
BEAFTERFORE the carved elephant.
Shit...

MARTA
She yanks the wheel and pulls off BEFORE the statue.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta trudges away from the parked car, tree branches
catching her hair.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Park and come back on foot up to the
house,

43.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE GATE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
A waist-high stone wall with a little pedestrian gate. The
house up ahead. Marta goes through the gate and up towards
the house.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Take the side yard path, through that
little gate.
The DOGS sprint down the moonlit yard from the house towards
Marta.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
The dogs will know you, they
shouldn't bark.
The dogs stop at Marta and lick her hand.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta looks up the side of the looming house. A sturdy
trellis on the wall, and high above a third story window.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You've got to get up to the third
floor without being seen, and the
only way is to climb the side trellis
and come in through the trick hall
window.
MARTA
You've gotta be kidding me.
I am not.

HARLAN (V.O.)
Do it.

Cut to: moments later, Marta climbing the trellis. It's
easy going until a piece BREAKS under her foot, and she
swings for a second by one hand.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
And for godssakes don't make any
noise.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
What appears to be a dead end hallway, with a painting at
the end. BUT suddenly the end wall swings away like a door,
revealing a WINDOW behind it. Marta heaves her way in
through it, and steps lightly into Harlan's bedroom.

44.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Once you're inside, this is the
tricky part.
MARTA (V.O.)
THIS is the tricky part?
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN (V.O.)
Get my robe and cap from my bedroom.
And put them on.
She picks them up from the bed.

Stops.

A moment of doubt.

INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Back to the scene with Harlan.

Marta stops him.

MARTA
Harlan this is - I - this is crazy HARLAN
We need to make this so airtight your
average cop will entirely dismiss you
as a suspect. This seems crazy but
it will work.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta in the robe, pulling the cap on, tucking her hair
under it.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Marta, in Harlan's robe and cap, creeps down the creaky
stairs, then keeps going down.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Walt and Jacob are smoking outside.
They'll see you...
INT. FOYER - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Marta come down the stairs, and sees the outline of Walt and
Jacob outside through the glazed window windows.

45.
HARLAN (V.O.)
...through the glazed window.
She holds her breath, a deer in the headlights.
WALT
Dad, go to bed.
Marta heads right back up the stairs.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You were seen leaving, the security
cameras show you driving off, and
twenty minutes later I am seen alive
and well by my son.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
Marta climbs the creaky stairs.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You've gone from suspect number one
to an impossibility.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Marta ducks in, ditching the robe and cap on the bed.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT
Marta shimmies down the last of the trellis.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Leave the way you came. And don't.

She hops to the ground, then FREEZES and almost shouts.
She's facing a darkened first floor window. Wide open.
inside it, staring RIGHT AT her, is Greatnana.
Marta is frozen. Greatnana isn't moving either.

After what seems like forever, Greatnana cocks her head
slightly and asks...

Marta breathes. And backs away.
quickly, down across the lawn.

Then turns and goes,

HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive home. Sometime in the next few
days the police will question you.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Back to Harlan and Marta.
MARTA
Harlan I can't lie I'll puke
HARLAN
Don't lie. Tell fragments of the
truth. In this exact order:
INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Blanc catches his coin. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper
Wagner look up at Marta, expectant. Just a brief moment has
passed since we left them.
MARTA
I took him upstairs. We played our
nightly game of GO, at some point he
knocked the board over and Joni came
up to check on us. Then I gave him
pain medication, he pulled his
shoulder last week, and left him in
his study. At midnight. Said bye to
Walt, went home.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What medication did he get?
Marta chooses her words very carefully:
MARTA
Since his injury I've been giving him
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol, a
non narcotic analgesic. And to help
him sleep, 3 milligrams of morphine.

Anything unusual about his demeanor?
Uh oh.

Marta keeps it solid. Superhuman effort.

No.

Then across the

INT. HALF BATH
Marta walks in, closes the door behind her, locks it, turns
on both the taps, and PUKES into the toilet.
INT. LINDA'S ROOM
Linda stands in her childhood room, by the window in the
ebbing light. From a shelf she pulls a stack of PINK
NOTECARDS, identical to the one Harlan showed Richard in his
office. But these are covered in writing, sweet little
notes, a father to his daughter.
WALT (O.S.)
Hey sis. People are going to start
getting here for the memorial pretty
soon. Are you- Are you alright?
She looks up. Walt in the doorway.
indicates the notes.

She wipes her eyes,

LINDA
I was just thinking about Dad's
games. This all feels like one, it
feels like something he'd write, not
do. I keep waiting for a big reveal,
where it all makes sense. How nice
would that be?
Her little brother hugs her.

His eyes tired and dark.

48.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
HARLAN THROMBEY - his portrait, with an ambiguous look on
his face.
Marta. Soda water in hand at the reception that night.
Staring shell shocked at Harlan.
The reception for friends of the family. Tables of food.
Twenty or thirty people milling, in dark tasteful clothes,
with the whole Thrombey family.
A tearful Fran has cornered Marta, talks through sobs:
FRAN
I don't think he killed himself I
don't. I don't. There's this
Hallmark movie Deadly By Surprise
where Danica McKellar plays a wife
who gets poisoned by her husband but
bit by bit so she thinks she's going
crazy and she ends up killing
herself, and my cousin who's the
receptionist at the medical examiners
office says that kind of thing can
totally happen, she says it's not
even like 3% as crazy as stuff she's
seen come through the As Fran's talking, Marta looks at the room of family
members, gathered around talking. She FLASHES BACK to:
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Harlan and Ransom go off together to have a private talk,
leaving the family having a heated conversation in the
living room.
RICHARD
I don't like him no he's an
asshole but maybe an
asshole's what we needed
oh uh huh yeah there you go
Marta stays on the outskirts.
champagne flutes:

JONI
Oh god. Yeah an asshole's
what Germany needed in
nineteen thirty ever
Fran, with a tray of

FRAN
Jesus. I'm gonna disappear until the
politics talk is done. You want some
champers?
MARTA
No I'm technically working.

Thanks.

Marta checks her watch. Meanwhile Donna, who's had a few, is
tearing into the family fight.
DONNA
We're losing our way of life
and our culture, there's
millions of Mexicans coming
and this isn't Joni don't
make this a race thing, I'd
say the same thing if they
were European immigrants we allow them in and they
think they own what's ours

RICHARD
Nobody's saying that isn't
bad, but I blame the parents

JONI

Oh god really - yeah it's
not a race thing yeah
Oh yeah, if the Swiss were
clogging in the streets They're putting. Children.
In cages. I mean these are
camps.
JONI
For wanting a better life
for their kids, isn't that
what America

RICHARD
For breaking the law. You're going
to hate hearing this but it's true,
America is for Americans. Marta, come
here.
Richard beckons her over, waving his cake plate. We've seen
this moment before, silent, during Richard's questioning.
LINDA
Oh god don't.
Marta is drawn over next to Richard, very uncomfortable.
RICHARD
No, Marta your family came from
Uruguay but you did it right, she did
it legally, I'm saying. You work
hard, and you'll earn your share from
the ground up just like dad and all
of us did - Marta I bet you agree
with me.

50.
LINDA
Leave the poor girl alone.
RICHARD
No Marta do you agree, I'd like you
to answer - you wanna become an
American, there are legal ways to do
it, but if you break the law it
doesn't matter if you have a good
heart, you gotta face the
consequences.
At that moment booming shouts begin behind the study door Harlan and Ransom going at it. Ransom bursts out.
Marta takes the opportunity to slip into the hallway, alone.
She breathes hard. Takes a champagne flute from the tray.
Drinks it in one gulp.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
END FLASHBACK. Marta in the same spot, Fran still talking
her ear off. The room sways. Marta sucks in breath, sways,
and braces herself against the wall.
FRAN
Oh my god Marta, what?
Meg runs over, rubs her back.
MEG
Whoa hey, c'mere, hey. What do you,
you want water? Breathe. Hey. Fran
have you still got your stash?
INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
Empty and dark, fireplace blazing. Above the fireplace is
an ornate mantle clock. Fran uses a key to unlock one of
several tiny drawers hidden in its face, takes out a joint
and hands it to Meg.
FRAN
Take em whenever you need em they're just drying out since you
gave me that Juul.
Thanks Fran.
Fran leaves them alone.

MEG

51.
MARTA
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
sorry

MEG
Stop saying you're sorry
Jesus

Meg lights the joint.
MARTA
God my heart won't stop, I can't it's just everything, no, thank you
she refuses the joint, then realizes where it came from.
MARTA (cont'd)
That's where Fran keeps her stash?
MEG
Who's going to open a clock?
INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt yells at a non responsive, bored Greatnana.
WALT
DO YOU WANT DINNER, NANA?
DINNER? TO EAT? EAT?

LINDA
Walt she's fine, she ate the
whole salmon spread already.

Meg grabs Walt, pulls him to Marta.
MEG
Did you tell Marta yet?
talked about?
WALT
No, not yet, is now a good
time?

What we all

MEG
Yes a very good time.
now.

WALT
We've talked it over, and
(wait)
Have you been smoking grass?
Marta.

No.

MEG
WALT
We talked it over and the whole
family, we want to take care of you.
MARTA
What does that mean?

Right

52.
MEG
We all think you deserve something.
WALT
Financially, we want to help you out.
You were never anything but good to
dad. Because of that, you can count
on us.
Walt embraces her, Meg puts a hand on her back.
Over Walt's shoulder, Marta sees Harlan's portrait again.
Has its expression changed? It looks like it has a slight
conspiratorial smile. Marta breathes - maybe this is all
going to be ok.
WALT (cont'd)
I thought you should have been at the
funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.
EXT. SIDE PORCH - NIGHT
Later.

Marta comes out to get some air.

Exhales deeply.

And then jumps - she's not alone. Benoit Blanc sits in a
wicker chair in the dark, smoking a long thin cigar.
MARTA
Wah ha. Detective. You're still here?
Mm.
Silence.

BLANC
Blanc smokes and stares at Marta.

Marta shifts.

MARTA
Did you know Harlan?
BLANC
He knew my father who was a police
detective. Years ago. My father
respected Harlan. That says quite a
lot.
MARTA
So that's why you're here?
BLANC
Here now here? No. I stayed hoping
to speak to you a little more.

53.

Uh?

MARTA
BLANC
Something is afoot with this whole
affair. I know it, and I believe you
know it.
MARTA
So you're... going to keep digging.
BLANC
Harlan's detectives they dig, they
rifle and root, truffle pigs. I
anticipate the terminus of gravity's
rainbow.
MARTA
Gravity's Rainbow.
BLANC
It's a novel.
I know.

MARTA
I haven't read it.

BLANC
Neither have I. Nobody has. But I
like the title. It describes the
path of a projectile, determined by
natural law. Voila, my method. I
observe the facts without biases of
the head or heart, I determine the
arc's path, stroll leisurely to its
terminus, and the truth falls at my
feet.
(beat)
The medical examiner was ready to
rule this a suicide, but Elliott
agreed to keep it pending for forty
eight hours. Tomorrow morning I
search the grounds and the house,
begin my investigation. I want you
to be by my side for it. My
confidant, my eyes and ears.
MARTA
What but - why me?

54.
BLANC
I trust your kind heart. Also you
are the only one who had nothing to
gain from Harlan's death. So.
Watson.
Blank puts out his cigar, stands.
MARTA
You want my insight into this family?
None of them are murderers. That's
my insight.
BLANC
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,
this machine unerringly arrives at
the truth. That's what it does.
Always?

MARTA
He does a little bow.
BLANC
Tomorrow at eight.
Marta watches him go.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marta gets home. Her mom is on the couch, zoning out in
front of the TV, still in a cleaning uniform. Without a
word Marta sits next to her. Stares at the TV.
Off her eyes, we FLASH BACK with her:
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN
I know I missed something... there's
going to be something I missed. But
I know you can beat it. Without
losing your soul you have to do what
you have to do to beat this, and win.
I can't.

MARTA
HARLAN
You can and you have to.
Right now.

For me.

55.
She's out the door and he shuts it.
INT. OUTSIDE HARLAN'S ATTIC OFFICE DOOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta stands frozen. Soft voices of Walt and Jacob float up
from downstairs. She turns back to the door.
Silence.
No.

Moments going by.

Shit.

Can she do this?

Shit.

She turns and pushes back into the office -

INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
MARTA
Harlan I have to get you help Harlan reclines on the couch in the middle of the room,
ornate dagger against his throat. Marta's eyes go wide.
HARLAN
Do what I say and everything's going
to be ok, Marta. I promise.
She makes a move to stop him and with one quick motion he
DRAWS THE DAGGER across his throat. Blood sprays.
She leaps back, hands to her mouth, spins and leaves the
room, closing the door behind her.
EXT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Breathing hard, silent crying. Then her breathing slows.
Her brain taking over. Resolve settling. The dice are
thrown. She wipes her eyes. Then bounds down the stairs,
out of frame.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
Back to Marta and her mom on the couch.

56.
They go back to watching TV.

But Marta's mind is buzzing.

On her white sneaker, we see but she does not - one single
drop of blood.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE GUARD GATE - MORNING
The gate is open, Marta's car pulls up just inside it. The
small Guard house next to the gate, Blanc, Elliott and
Wagner outside it. Blanc waves to her.
INT. GUARD HOUSE
Thrombey's security man, MR PROOFROC, guides them into the
cramped dusty space. Proofroc is old and salty. He shows
them old photos of the house, stuck to a steel fridge with
big brightly colored fruit magnets.
MR PROOFROC
Fifty years I worked this estate, you
know security back then meant making
the rounds with a 94, keeping your
ears open. Before all this modern
technology.
Nothing in the room is newer than 1988. An 8 inch CRT
monitor shows a phosphorescent live feed of the road outside
the gate, and a top loaded VHS VCR sits next to it.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
Well the video here, I saved the tape
from that night, usually I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser, but I
thought better save that one. Cause,
security. That's the live feed
there.
Marta notices something with alarm - the video feed shows
the road outside, and at the top edge you can just barely
see the carved elephant that marks the gardener's utility
road. She realizes Harlan said
HARLAN (V.O.)
...to avoid the security cameras,
pull off the road AFTER the carved
elephant.
Marta keeps a poker face, but.. shit.

57.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(to Proofroc)
Can we see the actual TAPE?
Oh sure.

MR PROOFROC
CLACK! The tape loads into the mechanical VCR. An
impossibly grainy, smeared night vision view of the road
outside the gate. Time stamp: 10:02pm.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's like a Japanese horror movie.
MR PROOFROC
(proud)
I record it SSLP, gets eight hours
per tape. Nine pm to five am.
BLANC
Can we (to Marta)
Can we scan forward?

MARTA
(to Proofroc)
Can we scan forward?

MR PROOFROC
Hold the play button down and press
the FF down halfway till you feel it
grind.
Wagner does, the machine makes horrible noises and the
picture frizzles and frazzles. Then stops and ejects.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
And hold the tape down or it'll
eject.
BLANC
Can your guys digitize it so we can
scan it properly?
TROOPER WAGNER
I'm sure we can.
I got it.

MARTA
Marta grabs the tape from the VCR.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
They all hack through the overgrown gardener's path.

58.
TROOPER WAGNER
You know all these statues that you
see around here - they are all
straight out of his series the
"menagerie tragedy series", pretty
cool.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
(dry)
Awesome. Blanc the grounds are
lovely but you think what, someone
broke into the house? To kill
Harlan? Is that why we're out here?
BLANC
I think it's an unlikely but if they
did, there will be traces.
TROOPER WAGNER
I'll take that, thanks ma'am.
Marta hands Wagner the VHS tape. Then she discretely
pockets something she had held in her hand next to it - a
few of the bright fruit MAGNETS from Proofroc's fridge.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
The group hikes up out of the woods, towards the low wall
with a small pedestrian gate that leads to the east lawn.
Marta is out in front. During the following, she notices
something: The earth around and under the gate is soft and
bare. And clear as day: HER FOOTPRINTS from the other
night, the only ones from women's shoes. The same ones she
has on now. Her breath catches. SHIT.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Any luck with - whatshisname?
TROOPER WAGNER
Ransom. No, but we have an address.
Ten Kenoak street.
BLANC
Ten Kenoak. That's a pleasant thing
to say. kenoak. I awoke amid
Kenoak.
TROOPER WAGNER
Ugh this mud, my boots are going to
stink.

59.
BLANC
Mud - has it rained the past week?
No - Nobody move! Freeze! Everyone!
These footprints must not be
disturbed!
(sees)
Marta!
Marta has already walked through the pedestrian gate and up
onto the lawn, stepping in her pre-existing prints. She
turns back, playing dumb.
What?

MARTA
BLANC
Don't - stop there, don't MARTA
I can't hear you, what?
She trots back to them through the gate, stepping into her
returning prints.
BLANC
No no no no don't - don't step on
the, ok, alright. Aughhhhh ok.
What?

MARTA
Blanc sidesteps up to the gate, not stepping in the mud.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Alright, Wagner let's get the boys on
it, check the prints, tape off this
area, keep it clear.
The dogs come running down the lawn, barking at the men.
They tear through the gate, further messing up the mud.
MARTA
Hey boys, easy. Hey.

Hey.

She pets them and they quiet down.
BLANC
Best judge of character is a dog.
I've found that to be true.
The dogs start BARKING and bolt towards the house, where
Richard and Linda are pulling up in their lux SUV.

60.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
They're doing the will reading at
ten, whole family will be here soon.
Elliott heads up towards the house.
lawn, and Marta follows.

Blanc meanders up the

MARTA
I've never been to a will reading.
BLANC
You think it'll be like a game show.
No. Imagine a community theater
performance of a tax return.
They approach the side of the house.
meandering study of the layout.

Blanc does a gentle,

Marta steals a look at the trellis she climbed.
Oh no. A piece of the white lattice trellis that broke off
when she was climbing - about eight inches long - lies in
the grass beneath it. Her eyes dart up - yup, there's the
broken spot. Shit.
SWEET BEANS

BLANC (cont'd)
Marta starts - did he spot it? No - he's come face to face
with Greatnana, standing stock still on the porch. She
stares at him like a bird.
BLANC (cont'd)
Good morning Mrs. Thrombey.
He approaches her, slowly. When his back is fully turned
Marta takes her shot and KICKS the piece of trellis under
some thick bushes at the base of the house.
Blanc and Greatnana stare at each other. Blanc gets very
close to her, great sympathy in his eyes. Greatnana stares
back. It's almost like they're communicating. This goes on
for a little too long. Then Blanc breaks from the trance,
and turns to Marta.
BLANC (cont'd)
Do you think you could handle the
study?

61.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY
The blood is now only a subtle dark stain, but other than
that the room has been left intact from the night of the
party. Marta and Wagner observe as Blanc paces the room.
BLANC
(to Marta)
Where's your medical bag?
MARTA
I... don't know - I left it here, I
always leave it with Harlan at night.
TROOPER WAGNER
They must have taken it in as
evidence. I'll check on it.
Blanc picks up the GO board and sets it on the table.
Examines its grid idly.
BLANC
How'd the GO board get knocked over?
MARTA
We were just goofing around.
(beat)
What are you thinking?
Blanc sighs gently, turns the baseball over in his hands.
Looks like this was a bust.
Blanc tips the GO board over, and it lands on the carpet
with a nearly inaudible WHOMPH. He stares at it.
But his concentration is broken by sharp barking outside.
They go to the tiny window and look out. A DASHING MAN in
his early 30s climbs out of a vintage Porsche. The dogs go
NUTS, biting at his pant legs.
BLANC
Let me guess.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
The man kicks off the dogs and limps toward the house,
cursing. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner step out
onto the porch.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hugh Drysdale?

62.
RANSOM
Ransom. Call me Ransom, my middle
name. The help call me Hugh.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I'm Lieutenant Elliott, this is
officer Wagner, we'd like to ask you
a few questions about the night of
Uh huh.

RANSOM
He blows past them and into the house.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt, Donna and Jacob (nose in his phone) sit around the
room. Linda and Richard stand, on their phones. Ransom
breezes in, bumping Donna who YELPS, startled.
Elliott and Wagner follow.
TROOPER WAGNER
Sir excuse me, we are officers of the
law.
RANSOM
You gonna run me in? I don't feel
like talking. I'm distraught.
Ransom disappears into the kitchen, comes out eating a
sleeve of pinwheel cookies.
Blanc and Marta slip in.

Elliott nods to Blanc.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc, anything you need to ask him?
RANSOM
The hell anyway is this arrangement?
Mr. Drysdale

BLANC
Ransom sizes up Blanc with a grin.
CSI KFC?

RANSOM
Ransom grabs Fran the housekeeper's sleeve as she walks by.

RANSOM (cont'd)
Hey Frannie can you get me a glass of
cold milk?
Meg and Joni have just entered, and Meg heard this.
Hey asshole.

MEG
Not her name, not her

Fran walks off with a scorching look at Ransom.
Meg.

RANSOM
How's your SJW degree coming?

MEG
Trust fund prick.

Alright.

JONI
Guys.

ALAN STEVENS, the family's attorney, knocks and enters with
an assistant, SALLY, who juggles several attache cases.
ALAN
Hey everyone. Hey. I'm just going
to set up in the other room, be ready
in ten minutes.
They go off to the library, leaving the family all together
in tense silence.
WALT
Funny Ransom, you skipped the funeral
but you're early for the will
reading.
JONI
Ok, people grieve in different ways,
let's not
WALT
(to Ransom)
It's funny you're here at all. Why
are you even bothering, that's what I
want to know.
RICHARD
What's that supposed to mean?
WALT
He knows what it means.
Walt, what?

LINDA

64.
WALT
Jacob was in that bathroom the night
of the party.
JONI
Is that where you were all night?
RICHARD
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?
Nothing.

JACOB
MEG
Swatting Syrian refugees.
No.

JACOB
MEG
Alt right troll.
JACOB
Liberal snowflake.
WALT
I don't know what any of that means
RICHARD
It means your son's a little creep.
WALT
Oh MY son's a creep?
Guys!

JONI
Walt he was in the bathroom...

WALT
He was in the bathroom
RICHARD
Joylessly masturbating to pictures of
dead deer.
WALT
Ok you wanna go?
They go at each other and do some half-hearted slap-fighting
before Linda and Joni break them apart. Ransom's loving
this.

65.
RANSOM
We gotta do this more often.
LINDA
Alright! Enough. Jacob, we get
where this is going. The bathroom's
next to Harlan's office, where he had
the big fight with Ransom. You heard
something. Spill it.
JACOB
I just heard two things.
INT. HALF BATH - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Jacob on the toilet, hearing non distinct yelling through a
vent high in the wall. But two words poke through:
...my will!

HARLAN (O.S.)

INT. LIVING ROOM
JACOB
And then there was more shouting, but
I also heard Ransom say "I'm warning
you."
Walt raises his arms, triumphant.
Ransom?

LINDA
What's this mean?

He just eats cookies, silent.
WALT
It means dad finally came to his
senses and cut this worthless lazy
brat out of the will.
(to Ransom)
And you better sell your little
Beamer and you better give your
notice at that country club and kick
whatever fashion drugs you're on
cause if you think after the bridges
you've burned, the shit you've said
and what you've put this family
through for the past ten years that
any of us are going to support you,
are going to give you like dad used
to say a single red dime you're nuts.

66.
Ransom looks around the room.
Son.

Cold faces.

RICHARD
RANSOM
(mock gravity)
Father?
RICHARD
Did Harlan tell you he was cutting
you out of the will?
Yes.

RANSOM
RICHARD
Then he's done what we weren't strong
enough to do - this might finally
make you grow up.
Ransom is really slapped by this but he doesn't let it show.
LINDA
I think it might be the best thing
that could happen to you.
RANSOM
Thanks - my mother, folks.
JONI
It won't be easy for you but it'll be
good. Nothing good is ever easy.
RANSOM
Up your ass Joni, you've got
your teeth bit into this
family tit so hard

MEG
Oh 'up your ass' very nice
you homophobic privileged -

RANSOM
(going down the line)
As a matter of fact - Eat shit, hows
that? In fact eat shit, eat shit eat shit - Definitely eat shit. Eat
shit.
And now everyone is shouting at each other.
Blanc has heard enough. He sets the baseball down on a side
table, and drifts out. Marta follows him.

EXT. FRONT PORCH
Blanc breathes in the air. Marta joins him.

From inside

MARTA
What was that about will readings

BLANC
Exception that proves the rule.
Fran bursts out of the living room, muttering
Asshole.

FRAN
She storms off around the house.

A beat of thought.

BLANC
I'm warning you. Ransom said.

Then:

One of the dogs bounds up the steps to Blanc.
MARTA
You heard Ransom in there, it's the
kind of thing he says.
When Blanc goes to pet him, the dog drops something to his
feet with a clatter. Marta freezes.
MARTA (cont'd)
What's he got there? Hey boy. You
find a stick? He's always bringing
junk into the house It's the piece of broken trellis. Blanc picks it up,
examines it, and suddenly his eyes go sharp.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
Holding the piece up as he studies the trellis that runs up
the side of the house. Marta runs up beside him.
BLANC
This looks like a relatively fresh
break - yes. Right there.
He's spotted the broken spot on the trellis.

BLANC (cont'd)
Wait - that doesn't make sense,
where's that window?
INT. LIVING ROOM
The whole family in a screaming match, but Blanc and Marta
walk through and up the stairs. Three people notice:
Elliott and Wagner (who follow) and Ransom (who doesn't.)
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING
Blanc looks down the "dead end" hallway.
out of breath.

Marta joins him,

BLANC
Show me, but don't step on the
carpet.
It's a runner rug, and Marta delicately steps on the wood
siding as she goes to the wall with the painting. And swings
it open, revealing the window.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's the trick window! From "A Kill
For All Seasons!"
Elliott and Wagner at the top of the stairs, and Blanc
motions them not to approach.
BLANC
Off the carpet!
He drops down to his knees, removes a loupe from his jacket,
and holds it in his eye. Then, his face inches from the
carpet, he scans it. All the way to the window. Then
stops.
BLANC (cont'd)
Traces of dried mud. I suspect they
go the length of the hallway.
Footprints?

MARTA
BLANC
No, just traces.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Depending on when it was last
cleaned, it could be from anytime

69.
BLANC
But that would not explain this.
He motions to the base of the window sill - obvious scuffs
of dried mud. Marta winces.
Blanc tosses the piece of trellis to Elliott.
BLANC (cont'd)
Analyze this mud. It will match these
traces, and you will find similar
samples leading up the trellis on the
side of the house.
(beat)
On the night of the party, somebody
who did not want to be heard climbing
the steps went to a great deal of
trouble to break into Harlan
Thrombey's rooms. The game is afoot,
eh Watson?
INT. LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER
The whole family assembled. Marta stands in the back, with
Blanc, Elliott and Trooper Wagner.
Alan Stevens, Harlan's attorney, sits at a table with papers
in front of him, assistant Sally beside him.
ALAN
Well. Thank you all for getting
together like this, it isn't legally
necessary but I thought because
you're all in town and some of you
are leaving soon, it would be best BLANC
Excuse me Mr. Stevens. As to that,
ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to

Nobody move until we figure this out.
Nobody likes this.
What?

JONI
Can we ask why? Has something
changed?
No.

BLANC
JONI
No it hasn't changed or no we can't
ask?
BLANC
Mr. Stevens, please continue.
ALAN
Right. Well the other reason I
thought this gathering would be, uh,
beneficial is that as I told Walt,
Harlan altered his will one week ago.
He sealed it and asked me not to
submit it to the courts for probate
until after his death. So in case
there's any confusion about anything
we're all together, we can talk. I
can't imagine any of it will be that
complicated, Harlan's assets included
um
...the house

SALLY
ALAN
the house which he owned outright, um
SALLY
sixty million
ALAN
right in various cash accounts and
investments, yes and of course the
real assets are sole ownership of um

publishing company. Ok.
Walt's wife puts her hand on his knee.
smiled tightly.

He squeezes it,

71.
ALAN (cont'd)
Um, he did write up a statement when
he made the recent changes, he wanted
it read first, so:
(reads)
"Some of you may be surprised by the
choice I've made here. No pleasure
was taken in the exclusion, and its
purpose was not to sow greater
discord in the family, quite the
opposite. Please accept it with
grace and without bitterness. But do
accept it. It's for the best."
Gently condescending eyes shift to Ransom. Linda sees this,
puts her hand on her son's hand, and he immediately gets up
and moves to a chair in the corner.
Alan's assistant hands him an envelope and he removes a
single sheet of paper with one short typed paragraph.
ALAN (cont'd)
Ok. So - oh wow, yeah, not complex
at all. This'll be quick. "I Harlan
Thrombey, being of sound mind and
body, yada yada, my assets both

We're his family, Alan he
obviously wasn't,

what but something wasn't
right here

RICHARD

Are there safeguards against
this?

And from the back of the room, slowly rising above the din
of confusion and cursing, slowly drawing even Marta's deer
in the headlights attention... Ransom. LAUGHING. Loud and
weirdly sincerely, tears down his cheeks, laughing his head
off.
JONI
Alan there's a mistake
MEG
Mom if it's what granddad
wanted

JONI
No this is a mistake, this
is ours.

LINDA
Alan take that piece of paper and
shove it up your ass and get out.
And you cops, out!
They don't but Ransom slips out, his child-like laughter
trailing after him.

LINDA
No, we need to talk and we need to
fight this thing and we're not going
anywhere. GET OUT! We're the
Thrombeys goddammit! This is still

A beat of silence. Then all eyes go to Alan. Who looks
down at the will. His assistant Sally points helpfully.
ALAN
Sorry, there's, uh. "Likewise the
house at two Deerborn Drive and all
belongings therein I leave to Marta

Linda goes for Marta.

JONI
Linda please - Marta, you need to
tell us though,
WALT
Yes Marta, did dad discuss
this with you?

JONI
You need to tell us
everything you know about
this and we need to talk
about this,

WALT
This isn't what dad wanted,
this isn't fair but we can
work this out

RICHARD
Jesus don't mob the girl,
let's talk about this

The whole family is coming towards her like zombies. Blanc
takes her by the arm and steers her towards the door.
BLANC
I think heads have to cool a little,
and in the meanwhile I'd maybe run.

74.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
Marta stumbles out of the house in a daze. Behind her, the
entirety of the family floods out after her, shouting
reassurances and questions and accusations and a general din
of confusion.
MARTA
I - I have no idea why he - I just
need to think - I'll call you or have
him call me or do something I don't
know
She gets in her car and slams the door, and it's instantly
like A Hard Day's Night - the family gathered around trying
to talk through the window and rapping to get her attention.
Marta keys the ignition - chug chug chug. Nothing.
not now - chug chug chug. It won't turn over.

Oh god,

Richard opens the door, she pulls it closed again and locks
it, this is like a horror movie. Blanc is trying to get the
family to back off but no dice.
Marta puts her head in her hands, all of it swirling and
echoing and horrifying, she has no idea what to do.
HONK!
She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and
through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche,
waving "get in." With no other options she pushes out of
her car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him.
As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back
at the family with a wave
RANSOM
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!
And they're gone.

The family keeps shouting at each other.

Blanc watches the Porsche recede, his expression unreadable.
DING! His phone buzzing. He checks it. His expression
darkens.
INT. RANSOM'S PORSCHE
Tearing down the private road, away from the house. He's
still laughing, she's still shell shocked. Slowly, his
laughter eases to a stop. A moment of silence.

RANSOM
Ok seriously though, what the hell?
She shakes her head, looks at him.

What the hell indeed.

RANSOM

Could we get an extra bowl please?

You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten all day? Eat.
She joylessly shovels food in her mouth, starving.
MARTA
This is a nightmare.
Uh huh.
Why

RANSOM
So why.
MARTA

RANSOM
Why. Hey, this is everything. There
has to be a bigger reason why and you
know it.
MARTA
Well Ransom how about it had more to
do with you guys than with me.

Yeah.

RANSOM
(agrees)
(beat)
Yeah that's the only thing that makes
sense.

76.
Marta is unexpectedly effected by this. The waitress
breezes by, sets an empty bowl on the table.
MARTA
Did he tell you anything?
RANSOM
Just I wasn't getting a cent.
MARTA
He wanted you to build
something from the ground
up, like your parents

RANSOM
something from the ground
up, like my parents

RANSOM (cont'd)
yeah. My mom built her business from
the ground up with a million dollar
loan from granddad. My dad owns none
of it, and mom made him sign a
prenup. He lives in fear.
I know that's what granddad wanted to
protect me from by doing this, and I
know I shouldn't say this out loud
but when he told me, Jesus Christ I
coulda killed him.

Dusk settles heavy.

Warm light from the windows.

There have to be options here.
ALAN (O.S.)
No. I don't know how many times I
can repeat the same two simple pieces
of information.
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Lit by a fire in the fireplace, the whole family pacing
around, Alan the lawyer looking very tired seated at a table
in the center of the room.
ALAN
If Harlan was of sound mind when he
made the changes, and we've all
confirmed he was
RICHARD
Would a sound person do
this! Sound how?

LINDA
The very action speaks to
unsoundness!

ALAN
not legally no, you not liking what
they did does not speak to
testamentary capacity.

JACOB
What about undue influence?
Yes!

WALT
Undue influence!

ALAN
(weary)
Did you just google that?
WALT
If Marta was manipulating dad
somehow, if we found out that she had
LINDA
Gotten her hooks into him

WALT
Somehow or something

ALAN
You need a strong case for that.
You've got nothing. "She endeared
herself to him through hard work and
good humor" won't cut the salami.
JONI
What about the slayer rule?
All eyes turn to her.

Her face is lit by her phone.

JONI (cont'd)
I did just google that.
ALAN
The slayer rule obviously does not
apply here.
RICHARD
What the hell is the slayer rule?
JONI
It's if someone is convicted of
killing the person they can't get
their inheritance.
ALAN
Not even convicted, even if they're
held responsible for their death in
civil court
Like OJ

WALT

ALAN
Like OJ, yes. But Harlan
committed suicide.

79.
All eyes turn to Blanc, who this whole time has been sitting
in a chair by the fire, lost in thought.
JONI
Detective Blank. You said that the
investigation is continuing. You
made a point of that. Do you suspect
foul play?
BLANC
Mister Blanc. If you please.
(beat)
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.
The eruption you would expect breaks out.
Marta?

RICHARD
BLANC
I have eliminated no suspects.
RICHARD
You're full of shit, I don't trust
this guy in the tweed suit, and Alan
god bless you you're useless.
Thank you.

ALAN
Alan takes that as an excuse to leave.
RICHARD
There's one answer to this:
renounce the inheritance.
WALT
She knows it's what she
should do, it's the right
thing to do.

she can
LINDA

We've gotta make her do the
right thing.

Meg rounds on her mom, speaks quietly, in tears.
MEG
Mom. If Granddad wanted Marta to
have everything, that's what he
wanted.
JONI
No, this was not him. He loved us,
he wanted us taken care of. He
wanted you to have an education.

JONI (cont'd)
Meg. You think I can pay for your
school?
This leaves Meg shaken.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Beer bottles now stacked up in front of Ransom. Marta has
just told Ransom everything. He stares into space, and
makes the slightest hint of a laugh which I'll write as:
Heuh.

RANSOM
MARTA
I know, just saying it it sounds
insane but it's all true. I think
Blanc's been on to me from the
start - I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom... my sister, we can't Nothing but silence from Ransom. Maybe he's deep in
thought. A strange glint in his eye.
MARTA (cont'd)
You going to say something?
RANSOM
I always thought I was the only one
who could beat Granddad at GO. I
always thought that meant something.
MARTA
I know you did.
RANSOM
At the party, that night, my last
conversation with him, our last
fight, that's what he told me, about
you. That you beat him nearly every
time. More than me. And I thought
what a strange thing to tell me. But
I think I get it now. I think it did
mean something.
(beat)
I'm not telling the family shit.
You're not going to jail. That
detective is not going to catch you.
And you're not giving up the family
fortune.
(MORE)

81.
RANSOM (cont'd)
Think about what Granddad did to see
this through, this was what he wanted
not just for you but for his family,
and for him. And yes for you.
You've come this far. Let me help you
go all the way.
Marta looks at him hard.
MARTA
This isn't you. You could turn me in
right now and get your cut of the
inheritance. Why?
RANSOM
Because fuck my family. They don't
deserve any of this. I can help you
and we can fool them all and get away
with it... and then you will give me
my cut of the inheritance. The
perfect ending, we all win. You, me
and Harlan. Deal?
Silence. Broken by Marta's phone ringing.

Marta takes a breath, looks at Ransom.

And picks it up.

Yeah are you?
MEG (ON PHONE)
I'm fine, I mean everyone's nuts,

know what I wanted, I wanted to say
sorry for how everyone was.
No...

ask...

Well the... with the, will.
you going to do?
Marta looks at Ransom.

What are

What indeed.

MARTA
What do you think I should do?
MEG (ON PHONE)
You should do what you think is...
right. I think you should give it
back to us. Granddad always took
care of us, we're his family, I know
he was like family to you but we're
his actual family. Marta you know
this isn't fair, we've always been
good to you and we're going to take
care of you, everyone loves you and
you're like family and we'll take
care of you but you have to make
things right, you know what's right.
Marta, keeping eye contact with Ransom. Then, her voice
quavering, Meg drops what is for her the big bomb:
MEG (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
Marta, mom's broke, she says I'll
have to drop out of school.
MARTA
No, no. I won't let that happen.
(beat)
Whatever money you need Meg, I'll
help you. I don't want you to worry.

Meg on the phone. Her face horrified, mortified, barely
comprehending what she's just heard.

Meg hangs up, lets the phone drop from her ear. Tears in
her eyes. She turns to her whole family gathered behind
her, silent and expectant.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Marta realizes the connection's dead, holds the phone in her
hand like something delicate she just broke.
RANSOM
Ok then. Did the detective find
anything suspicious at the house?
MARTA
(in a daze)
Mud. Tracks upstairs - where I broke
in through the window.
Ransom winces.
RANSOM
Identifiable prints?
No.

MARTA

BLANC
Good Morning Mrs. Thrombey.
A long pause as he thinks of exactly the right word.
BLANC (cont'd)
Why is grief the providence of youth?
I don't know. But I'd imagine that
age deepens all feelings. Including
grief. This was a long walk to
offering condolences for the loss of
your son. And asking you if it isn't
presumptuous of me to not think too
harshly of your family, if I am as I
suspect the first to console you.
They're young aren't they.
Blanc sits.
BLANC (cont'd)
One thing I do assume of age is
weariness. Damned if I don't get
more tired every day. Tired of what
I do. Following arcs, like lobbed
rocks. The inevitability of truth.
But the complexity and the gray lies
not in the truth but what you do with
the truth once you have it.
Greatnana's eyes move slightly.
BLANC (cont'd)
I think you have something you want
to tell me. I think you're very
perceptive and very capable of
telling me what you saw the night of
your son's party. But I'll happily
wait. I'm in no rush. I find it
quite pleasant. Sitting here with

Marta flips through the envelopes, squinting.
WALT
it isn't from us. Maybe just local
lawyers and accountants who saw the
news and want to jump on it, I'd be
careful of it all.
One envelope sticks out - a blank plain letter sized
envelope, no postage, no return address.

We can protect you from that
happening, or if it happens.
MARTA
You're saying even if it came to
light, with the family's resources
you could help me fix it.

Yes. The right lawyers, none of

The building is a charred brick husk. Black smoke, debris.
It's been gutted with an explosion and a blazing fire.

The whine of the engine, Ransom puts on his seat belt. In
the rear view, siren lights as cop cars pour out of the

Are you flooring it?

Her phone rings - Blanc again. She looks over - cop cars
are RIGHT ALONGSIDE them. Blank holds his phone up, looks
at her quizzically. Points to the phone.
RANSOM (cont'd)
This is going well.
MARTA
This is stupid, I'm pulling over
RANSOM
If you miss your shot at getting that

MARTA
Aaauuuuuawwwaaagghhhh
She hits the brakes.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta's car PEELS TO A STOP and the two COP CARS on either
side blaze by, hitting their brakes.
She pulls off onto a SIDE STREET and into narrower city
streets, down narrow alleys, using her small car to nimbly
dart though small spaces.
The cops can't follow, and she loses them.
She pulls to a stop in a secluded little back lot.
INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta, breathing hard.

Ransom is shocked.

94.
MARTA
Ok. I'm all just pure
adrenaline now it's like I
swallowed bees. What's the
the whatsitcalled address
ok. And I just - I mean
whatever they want, I just
say yes right, just to get
that report back.
And destroy it. Ransom.
Thank you. I couldn't do
this without you.
He smiles slightly.
Then:

RANSOM

1209 Columbus road.

And destroy it.

A quick moment of silence between them.

RAP RAP RAP on Ransom's car window.

Blanc. Standing right outside. Marta looks in her rear
view - the cop car has pulled up silently behind them.
Another pulls up in front.
EXT. PARKING LOT
Ransom and Marta step out of the car, hands raised for some
reason.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
That was the dumbest car chase of all
time. Put your hands down.
BLANC
(to Marta)
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana. The night of the party
she saw someone climb the trellis to
the third floor.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Drysdale, come with us please.
Elliott leads Ransom off by the elbow. Ransom throws a look
back at Marta - he has no idea what's going on.
MARTA
What's going on?
BLANC
"Ransom came back" she said. I don't
know what he came back to do, but
we'll find out.

95.
Marta looks at Ransom - oh no. Senile Greatnana thought she
was him. This is a mistake. But... she glances at her
watch - 9:51.
BLANC (cont'd)
Did he ask you to drive when he saw
me coming?
Ransom's being led to the police car.
Yes.

Marta decides:

Marta gets back in her car. She pretends to take a sip from
an empty soda cup, but actually SPITS UP a little into it.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.)
Blanc. Coming with us?
BLANC (O.S.)
(to Elliott)
I'll drive with Marta.
To Marta's horror Blanc opens her passenger door.
BLANC
Let's go to the police station, I
want a full run down of everything he
said to you, and I can catch you up
on where we're at.

Strange case from the start. A case

I'm just talking through my process

Marta's arms are locked, her eyes steal a glance at the
clock - 9:58.
BLANC (cont'd)
I feel the noose tightening - the
family are truly desperate.

BLANC (cont'd)
Desperate motives, the mystery of who

A donut! One central piece, and if it
reveals itself the fog would lift,

Marta runs into a bustling hair salon.

Marta ducks out the back door of the salon, goes two doors

INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
Dark, empty retail space. Lit only by the painted-over

Hello?

MARTA
Her foot hits something on the dirty concrete floor.

97.
HER MEDICAL BAG.
She kneels, picks it up gently.
Next to where it was lying, she finds something else
curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper. Only a
charred corner remains.
She turns her attention back to the room.

Creeps forward.

MARTA (cont'd)
Hello?
Ahead - a silhouette. A person. Seated in a chair, in the
center of the room. Silent, facing her.
MARTA (cont'd)
Listen I don't know what you want.
Whatever you want we can work it out,
but we have to figure it out right

that report.
A beat of silence.

Nothing.

Hello?

Something's not right here.

A SPIDER crawls across Fran's face.

Marta STIFLES A SCREAM

A moment of stillness. Her phone BUZZES - Blanc calling.
Marta ignores the call, frozen.
Her eyes go to: A white letter sized ENVELOPE in Fran's
hand, resting on her lap.
Marta swallows. Leans in, carefully and quietly for some
reason, and SLIPS the envelope from the lifeless fingers.
Unsealed. She opens it.
It is empty.

98.
Before this can even sink in, a rattling, grating DRAW OF
BREATH - from Fran.
Marta starts - oh my god - and goes to her, checking a
pulse, checking her eyes, lays her on her back. Fran sucks
in thin breath, her eyes finding Marta in the glare of the
dropped phone flashlight.
MARTA (cont'd)

EMT's run into the abandoned storefront.

Marta looks at him.

MARTA
But why did Fran take my morphine?
Obviously she had swiped my bag from
the house, but she didn't seem like a
user to me, unless that's why she
needed money...
(beat)
I dunno, doesn't matter. I should
tell the Thrombeys myself, I feel
like I owe that to them.
BLANC
I don't think that's a good idea
MARTA
No, I need to do it. I won't do any
of this if I can't do that. I really
need to. I gave the doctors my
number, they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.
BLANC
We'll round up the Thrombeys at the
house, along with a police escort.
MARTA
For the arrest after.
BLANC
You can tell me your whole story on

surprises.
Marta stands, a dead man walking, resigned.

I know where the tox report is.

Marta jimmies the clock drawer open with a letter opener.
She pulls a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from inside, blows loose

She practically told me where it was.
Anyway this'll tie everything up.

To be fair you're a pretty lousy

He firmly guides Marta out by the elbow.

shouting come from the other room.

then Blanc.

Wagner enters.

Please keep the family out of this
room and get them out of the house if
you can. But stand by with your
additional officer.
TROOPER WAGNER
Get the family out?
BLANC
Yes but not all of them.
Blanc whispers something to Wagner, who nods and exits.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc c'mon, what's all this Drama.
Indulge me.
Marta sits.

BLANC
Elliott remains standing.
MARTA
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
you, I'm telling you now - it is an
immovable fact that I killed Harlan.
BLANC
Yes you did, yes he did, yes you are,
but. But.
(MORE)

105.
BLANC (cont'd)
I spoke in the car about the hole at
the center of this donut. And yes,
what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance to fill
that hole perfectly. A donut hole in
the donut's hole. But we must look a
little closer. And when we do, we
see that the donut hole has a hole in
its center - it is not a donut hole
at all but a smaller donut with its
own hole, and our donut is not whole
at all!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc I understand that this is
amusing for you BLANC
Why. Was. I. Hired? Why would
someone hire me?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Someone fishing for any crime that
could help reverse the will.
BLANC
I was hired before the sealed will
was read. Yes, the person must have
known the contents of the will. But
one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was
committed, and further, if the intent
was to reverse Marta's inheritance,
they must have known that Marta was
responsible.
(beat)
An intriguing combination of factors.
Someone who knew what Marta did,
wanted to expose it, but could not
reveal how they knew.
MARTA
Fran? She was blackmailing me, she
knew what I did
BLANC
But Fran wanted money, ergo she did
not want the crime exposed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Did someone in the family see Marta
doing something suspicious?

106.
BLANC
They would have had no reason to not
speak up. No. The answer is not so
simple.
Blanc sits, suddenly weary.
BLANC (cont'd)
Now with the entire solution in my
field of view, the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors. And Marta,
it will not be easy to hear. But
there is at least one truly guilty
party behind it all, guilty in the
true sense of acting with malice, and
committing a heinous crime with
selfish intent.
(calls)
Trooper Wagner.
MARTA
(stunned)
Trooper Wagner??
Blanc squints at her.

No.

A moment later Wagner leads Ransom in.
Marta softly, sadly.

Ransom looks at

everything, I figured it was all up.
I'm sorry.
MARTA
It's alright Ransom, I'm glad you
did.
BLANC
Not exactly everything though.
MARTA
Is this about what Greatnana told
you? She saw me that night, she
mistook me for Ransom
BLANC
We'll get to that. But first, Mr.
Hugh Ransom Drysdale, you might tell
us all why you hired me.
RANSOM
Why I hired you?

107.
BLANC
You're right, let's back up. To the
night of the party. Your argument
with Harlan. What were the overheard
words by the Nazi child masturbating
in the bathroom - "my will" and "I'm
warning you." You and Harlan were
"drama mamas," you shared a love of
twisting the knife into one another.
I don't believe he would have slipped
it in halfway - no, I submit that
Harlan told you everything.

Push into a vent in the wall.

RANSOM
That is some heavy duty conjecture.
BLANC
Granted. But it's the only way what
comes next makes sense. So you storm
out, you drive off into the night.
You tell Marta later of what was it,
feeling an overwhelming sense of...

Clarity. That he has to make do for
himself from here on out.
Exactly.

EXT. NORFOLK ROADS - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom's Porsche SKIDS TO A STOP on the side of the empty
road. Sits idling.
BLANC (V.O.)
Marta. The will. Harlan. "You

A beat. Then the Porsche roars into a skidding U-TURN and
drives back the way it came.

EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom's Porsche kills its lights and drives slowly down the
private road, hooking a left at the CARVED ELEPHANT that
marks the utility road.
BLANC (V.O.)
You return, careful to avoid the

The Porsche parked, Ransom hacks his way through the woods.
BLANC (V.O.)
Then on foot up towards the house,
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY
The party is still going on inside. Ransom slips through
the side gate, up towards the house, and up the trellis.
BLANC (V.O.)
You sneak in, up the trellis so as
not to be seen by the rest of the
family, who are still having their
party downstairs.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
The painting wall swings aside, and Ransom climbs through,
leaving mud traces on the sill and the carpet. He heads
straight down the narrow hall and into Harlan's bedroom.
The party din from downstairs.
BLANC (V.O.)
What you need to do will take
moments. But it is essential you are
alone, and undetected.
Ransom disappears into the darkened doorway.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
You knew the medications Harlan took.
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.

BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
And you knew if Marta was responsible
for his death, even unintentionally,
the slayer rule would nullify the
changed will, and you would get your
share back.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM
Dark and still. Marta's medical bag, open. Ransom has
unwrapped two syringes and has the two vials out - the
Toradol and the morphine (the "good stuff.")
Using the syringes he extracts the liquid from both vials...
and then injects the liquids back into the opposite vials.
He SWITCHES THE MEDICATIONS.
BLANC (V.O.)
You use the syringes in the kit to
switch the liquids in the two
medication vials. And as a final
precaution, you take the Naloxone,
the life saving antidote.
Replacing the vials he takes an injection pen, closes the
bag up and leaves.
INT. LIBRARY
Marta is stunned, she can't even process this.
MARTA
No, no that's impossible.
BLANC
It is the truth. Hand me that vial
of morphine, I'll show you.
Blanc has placed two identical vials on the table behind
Marta. Her mind is still spinning, she glances at them,
takes one and absently hands it to him.
MARTA
If he did that, if the meds were
switched, then when I got them mixed
up...
(oh my god)
I accidentally switched them back.
But then I gave Harlan

111.
BLANC
The correct doses. Yes. But not
accidentally. I taped over the
labels of these two vials.
Blanc shows white tape over the one she just handed him.
Picks up the other vial, shows the same.
BLANC (cont'd)
The vials themselves are identical.
How did you know that this was the
morphine?
MARTA
I... just knew
BLANC
You knew because there is the
slightest, almost imperceptible
difference of tincture and viscosity
between the liquids. You knew
because you had done it a hundred
times. You gave him the correct
medication. Because you are a good
nurse.
MARTA
Then Harlan was...
BLANC
I'm sorry Marta. But yes.
was perfectly fine.

Harlan

He unfolds the tox report and hands it to her.
BLANC (cont'd)
His blood was normal. The cause of
death was truly, solely suicide, and
you are guilty of nothing but some
damage to the trellis and a few
amateur theatrics. In fact if he had
listened to you, he would be alive
today.
Marta is white as a ghost.
Hot damn.

She shudders, buckles over.

LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
BLANC
A twisted web, and we are not
finished untangling it. Not yet.

climbing down the trellis she said

GREATNANA
Are you back again already?

BLANC (V.O.)
Are you back again already, because
earlier that night CUT TO: the exact same scene but RANSOM hops down off the
trellis, and is startled by Greatnana staring at him.
GREATNANA
Ransom, you're back!
He puts his finger to his lips - shhh, and blows a kiss as
he walks off into the night.
INT. LIBRARY
Marta with her fingers on her temples, still unbelieving.
RANSOM
Marta c'mon.
(to Blanc)
This is stoopid with two o's and you
don't have a shred of evidence,
you're just spinning a fairy tale.
BLANC
Not a shred no, just as we have no
real proof of Marta's mixing up the
vials so it's your word against RANSOM
You have her confession!
The sharpness of this makes Marta look at Ransom for the
first time.
BLANC
Ah right, we do have that. If you'll
indulge me, I'd like to spin a little
further.

EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Moonlit, silent.

Much later that night you would have
to come back to the house, to break
back in and retrieve the
incriminating tampered vials.
A dark figure, Ransom, approaches the side gate. But when
he opens it, the two dogs come bounding across the lawn,
barking loudly.

However, this time the dogs were

A nervous Ransom tears a clipping from the local newspaper
about Harlan's death, stuffs in it an envelope with a huge
fold of cash, and addresses it to Blanc. The New Yorker
profile open on the couch.

Trooper Wagner quickly shushs Elliott, enthralled by every
word Blanc says.
BLANC
The body was discovered early the
next morning. The police, the
medical examiners, the family,
everyone swarms in,
(to Ransom)
and there is no possible way you can
get to Marta's medical bag to remove
the vials. You must wait for your
moment, when the investigation is
over and you know the house will be
empty. And that is why you missed
the funeral.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - AFTERNOON - FLASHBACK
Ransom bounds up the stairs, climbs under the POLICE TAPE
blocking Harlan's study, and enters.
BLANC (V.O.)
there is no one home to wonder why
you're going into Harlan's study. Or
so you think.
Fran comes around the corner, spots Ransom and is about to
say something, but doesn't.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
Poor Fran. She witnessed you
tampering with Harlan's medication in
the medical bag. She did not know
what you were doing. But she knew
you were up to no good. And so her
mind begins to turn.
Ransom pockets the two incriminating vials from the medical
bag and replaces the Naloxone pen. When he stands to go she
retreats.

BLANC
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom.
So the poor girl decides to test her
theory and make this asshole pay.
She gets a copy of the toxicology
report, I will be honest I have no
idea how
MARTA
She has a cousin - she told me, she
has a cousin who works as a
receptionist at the examiners office!
BLANC
Well voila. The numbers mean nothing
to her, but if Ransom is guilty its
existence is a threat, so she
photocopies the header and makes her
blackmail note.
MARTA
So why did she send it to me?
She did not.

BLANC
She sent it to Ransom.

INT. RANSOM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
Ransom walks in sorting mail - finds the blank envelope,
reads the blackmail note inside, and slowly grins.
BLANC (V.O.)
And when Ransom first gets it, what
is his reaction? Elation! He still
thinks Marta gave Harlan the tampered
drugs! A blood tox report will prove
Marta's guilt!

INT. LIBRARY - DAY - FLASHBACK
The will reading, the family assembled. Ransom sits in
back, a sly smile on his face as the will is read.
BLANC (V.O.)
He goes to the will reading in high
spirits, ready to see the family tear
themselves apart, secure in the
knowledge that it will all be undone
when the tox report comes to light.
And then...

Marta has just confessed.

Ransom's face

BLANC (V.O.)
Marta's confession. And everything
turns on its head. Now he realizes
that Marta has committed no crime,
and the tox report will prove her
innocence. The changed will is going
to stand. He has lost. Unless.

Blanc rounds on Ransom.
BLANC

She turns

FRAN
I knew it. I knew you were a no good
son of a bitch, I knew Harlan
wouldn't have just killed himself.
Yes,

RANSOM
you were right Fran.

Ransom sees the medical bag on the floor, kneels and pulls
something out of it.
FRAN
I knew you were guilty as shit. Now
you're gonna pay for it don't come
near me I'm warning you I But he's upon her, hand over her mouth, stifling her scream
as he pushes the syringe into her neck and PUSHES THE
PLUNGER.
MINUTES LATER - her inert body in the chair. He fishes
through her pockets, finds the envelope, and takes the TOX
REPORT from it, leaves the empty envelope in her hands.
On his way out: lights the tox report on fire, drops it
burning next to Marta's bag. We stay with it as it burns
away.
BLANC (V.O.)
Now the board is set. Marta will get
the blackmail note. You will put the
pieces together for her - the tox
report, her one chance at getting
away with it all. You'll guide her
to the rendezvous.

BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
You'll make an anonymous call to the
police, they will catch her there
with the body and the burned
evidence. Marta will be arrested for
killing Fran... and Harlan.

She said -

She didn't say "you did this," she
wasn't talking about me, she said

Exact same moment but this time we hear FRAN
Hugh... did this...
INT. LIBRARY
MARTA
Hugh did this. Cause you made the
help call you Hugh. Cause you're an
asshole.
BLANC
(to Ransom)
It would have worked. If we hadn't
brought you in for questioning, so
you could not make your anonymous
call. And if Fran had not stashed a
safety copy of the tox report.

INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - FLASHBACK
Marta turns away from the dying Fran.
BLANC (V.O.)
And if Marta had not outplayed you
once again.
Marta turns back, calls 911, gives mouth to mouth to Fran.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
By having a kind heart. By saving
Fran's life, though it meant her
losing the inheritance and going to
jail. She didn't play your game, she
saved Fran's life.
INT. LIBRARY
For the first time, Ransom looks afraid.
RANSOM
Fran's alive?
Marta's phone starts to ring.
it's the hospital.

They all see the caller id -

BLANC
(to Marta)
Oh yes. Fran, who will confirm this
fairy story or something close to it.
(to Ransom)
And will send you, Hugh, to jail.
She answers the call, puts the phone to her ear.
Yes.

MARTA
A long beat, then her face breaks in relief.
MARTA (cont'd)
Yes. Thank you doctor, that's great
news, we'll be there soon.
She hangs up.

And smiles with radiant joy.
MARTA (cont'd)
She's okay.
(to Blanc)
She's ready to talk.

121.
Ransom stares at Marta, his face a mask.
BLANC
Trooper Wagner, if you would keep Mr.
Drysdale in custody while Lieutenant
Elliott, Ms. Cabrera and myself go to
the hospital to take Fran's
statement.
Ransom stands. Steps to Marta, who's frozen, looking in his
eyes. His poker face breaks. And he grins.
RANSOM
I want to say this just to you, not
to a courtroom of cameras, just to
you because you know it's the truth:
we allowed you into our home. We
allowed you to take care of granddad,
to be part of our family and now you
think you can steal it from us? You
think I'm not going to fight for our
birthright, our home, our ancestral
family home?
BLANC
Harlan bought this house in the
eighties. From a Pakistani real
estate baron.
RANSOM
Oh shut up Blanc, shut up! Shut up
with that Kentucky fried fog horn
rag-horn drawl. Yeah I killed Fran
but I guess I didn't, so what do you
have on me. Nothing
What? attempted murder (to Blanc)
I get arson for the bombing, maybe a
few other charges, with a good lawyer
I'll be out before you know it.
Face to face, Ransom's face hateful, Marta's strong and set.
RANSOM (cont'd)
(to Marta)
And then you'll see just how much
hell I can wreak on your life, you
vicious little bitch.
But then... Marta's face starts to do things. Odd things.
Convulses. Her jaw clenches. Her cheeks bulge.
And the PROJECTILE VOMITS into Ransom's face.

122.

AUGH!

RANSOM (cont'd)
WHAT THE SHIT!

He falls back cursing, she drops to her knees, spitting.
Wagner, inappropriately excited:
TROOPER WAGNER
That means she was lying!
MARTA
That's right, Fran's dead.
(to Ransom)
And you just confessed to her murder.
Ransom takes this in.
Well.

Then he smirks.

In one fluid motion he spins to the ornamental WALL OF

Harlan's old baseball being set carefully back in

envelope on the desk. Picks it up, takes out the blank
note. Seems to recognize it, and smiles sadly.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - LATER
Linda comes outside and joins the family.
Several more police cars, and an ambulance.
Ransom is
loaded into the cop car. His family are held at bay by
officers, but they react in different ways Richard yelling at the cops. Walt sobbing, Donna collapsed
against him, Jacob on his phone.
Joni staring into space, ruined. Meg talking to Lieutenant
Elliott, crying. She's just learned about Fran.
Linda watches the circus, strangely disconnected, going to
light a cigarette. With a strange smirk, she uses the flame
to warm the blank note from the office, and HIDDEN WRITING
starts to appear - a note from her father. Their secret
communication. As the letters appear, her face changes.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Marta sits, a blanket over her shoulders. An officer who's
just taken her statement walks away. Blanc approaches.
MARTA
Can I ask. At what point did you
suspect I had something to do with
Harlan's death?

BLANC

The tiny, faded spot of blood.

Oh my god.

MARTA
BLANC
I want you to remember something very
important: you won not by playing
the game Harlan's way, but yours.
Through the window she sees the family outside.
MARTA
I should help them.

Right?

BLANC
I have my own opinion. But I have a
feeling you'll follow your heart.
He gives her a wink, and strolls off.
INT. FOYER - LATER
Marta shuffles to the front doorway. One last glance at
Harlan's portrait, its grin now gentle and content.
EXT. FRONT PORCH / BALCONY
She stands on the threshold. Sees Blanc get into the front
door of a cruiser, and it drives off - Ransom in the back.
He looks back at her through the window.
The family out on the lawn. Not sure where to go or what to
do. They all turn to see: Marta standing very small, but
somehow not, in the doorway of her house.
