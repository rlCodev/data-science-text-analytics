THE FAREWELL
by
Lulu Wang

INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM - DAY
A PAINTING displays an idyllic landscape, bathed in
institutional fluorescent lighting. Off-screen, we hear
sounds of a Chinese announcement amidst other bustling
hospital sounds.
A phone buzzes, answered by an authoritative female voice.
[Hello?]

NAI NAI (O.S.)

[*Note: All Chinese Mandarin dialogue in brackets. Other
languages will not be subtitled.]
NAI NAI (80) walks into frame holding a cell phone. A head of
neatly-permed white hair, this woman is the consummate
matriarch.
BILLI (O.S.)
[Nai Nai. Hi!]
Hearing her granddaughter’s cheerful voice, Nai Nai breaks
into a warm smile.
NAI NAI
[Billi! It’s the middle of the
night there, why aren’t you
sleeping?]
BILLI (O.S.)
[Middle of the night? It’s
seven...]
NAI NAI
[Seven at night?]
EXT. NYC - EVENING
Horns BLARE as BILLI WANG (30) walks quickly through the
kinetic streets of New York City. She’s in her element here.
Her movement is effortless, even as she switches between
speaking Mandarin and English.
WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEIR PHONE CONVERSATION.
BILLI
[Yea, it's always twelve hours time
difference! Isn’t it seven in the
morning in China?]
NAI NAI
[It’s almost seven thirty!]
(beat)
(MORE)

2.
NAI NAI (CONT'D)
[Is it cold there? Are you wearing
enough? Cold travels through the
head! Are you wearing a hat?]
BILLI
[I am.]
(she’s definitely not)
[Stop worrying about me!]
NAI NAI
[You have to be careful. I read
that in New York there are men who
steal your earrings. They rip them
out! And then you have to go to the
hospital to get your ears stitched
up!]
BILLI
[I’m not wearing earrings, Nai
Nai!]
NAI NAI
[Ah. So you heard too.]
A loud Chinese ANNOUNCEMENT blares through the phone.
BILLI
[Hey, what’s that sound? Nai Nai,
where are you?]
The announcement continues.
NAI NAI
[Me? I’m... I'm at your great
aunt’s house.]
Clearly in a hospital, Nai Nai tells this lie with total
ease.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[What are you doing?]
BILLI
[I’m heading to Mom and Dad’s for
dinner...]
Before Billi can finish, a STREET CANVASSER interrupts with
performative cheerfulness.
STREET CANVASSER
Hi! Do you have a minute to save
the polar bears?
Billi stares blankly, annoyed by the interruption.

3.
BILLI
I really wanna say something
snarky, but I used to have your
job.
STREET CANVASSER
(still smiling)
So you know how important it is to
support us!
BILLI
I know your job sucks.
Suddenly sympathetic, Billi stops.
BILLI (CONT’D)
(on phone)
[Hold on, Nai Nai...]
She pulls out her wallet. All she has is a dollar. She hands
it to the stranger, who eyes it cynically.
STREET CANVASSER
Lemme guess, you got fired?
BILLI
(feigns being offended)
I quit!
(beat, with a laugh)
Cuz I was about to get fired!
Billi and the canvasser share a laugh before Billi returns
her attention to Nai Nai.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[Sorry, Nai Nai.]
NAI NAI
[What was that?]
BILLI
[Nothing. Just um... a friend...]
Another announcement blares through the hospital speakers.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[Hey, Nai Nai, what is that? What’s
going on?]
NAI NAI
[It’s nothing. I’ll call you back
later, OK?]
Nai Nai’s abruptness catches Billi slightly off-guard.

4.

Uh, OK...

BILLI

NAI NAI
[I’ll call you back granddaughter!
I promise I’ll call you back!]
BILLI
OK. [Call me la...]
The line clicks before Billi can finish. It’s odd, but Billi
shrugs it off and descends into the subway station.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, CT SCAN MACHINE - DAY
The bed slides out of the machine. A RADIOLOGIST helps Nai
Nai sit up.
RADIOLOGIST
[You can get dressed.]
NAI NAI
[Where's my sister?]
RADIOLOGIST
[She’s with the doctor.]
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, DOCTOR WU'S OFFICE - DAY
Little Nai Nai sits alone across from DOCTOR WU. Though we
don’t hear their conversation, Little Nai Nai absorbs what is
clearly terrible news.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY
Little Nai Nai is overwhelmed with grief, but there’s no time
for this. Her mind races. Then, with a deep breath, she makes
her decision. Yes, it’s clear what she must do.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM - DAY
Little Nai Nai approaches her distressed sister in the
waiting room. She musters up a believable smile.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[OK, let's go.]
Her voice is light and bright.
NAI NAI
[Did you talk to the doctor?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Yep. You're in full health.]

5.
NAI NAI
[Really? What about the CT scan?
What about the spots they saw
before?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[It's all clear. Turned out to be
nothing. Just... benign shadows.]
NAI NAI
[Benign shadows? What's that mean?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
(shrugs nonchalantly)
[That's just what the doctor said.]
Nai Nai seems uncertain as she looks at her sister’s beaming
smile. Little Nai Nai helps her stand, still radiating with
optimism.
As they leave the hospital, Nai Nai seems sufficiently
convinced.
HAIYAN (O.S.)
(prelap)
... and one day the wife goes out
of town. When she returns, her
husband greets her right away, and
he says, 'honey your cat is dead.'
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, DINING ROOM (QUEENS, NYC) - NIGHT
HAIYAN WANG (late 50’s), also known as DAD, smiles with selfassurance as family and friends anticipate the rest of his
joke.
Billi watches her father adoringly, sipping brandy around the
remains of their dinner.
HAIYAN
The wife gets very upset, you know?
She says to her husband, how can
you be so insensitive? You just
tell me so abruptly like this?
Despite his slight Chinese accent, Haiyan's a natural
storyteller.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
Her husband is you know, confused!
He says to his wife... OK, how do
you want me to tell you in the
future? She says, “You have to not
be so direct. It’s too sudden.
(MORE)

6.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
You have to, you know, be more
gentle in delivering the news. For
example, ease me in with something
like ‘Listen, honey... your cat...
it got on the roof...’”
A few scattered chuckles from the table. JIAN LU, also known
as MOM (late 50's), enters with plates of cake.
KATHY
Oh my gosh, I’m stuffed. I don’t
know if I have room for dessert.
Haiyan is slightly irritated by the interruption.
HAIYAN
Come, sit down...
Come, Mom.

BILLI

HAIYAN
Where was I? Oh right... A few
months go by. The wife goes out of
town again. When she returns home,
her husband’s there to greet her
again. This time, he learned his
lesson. When his wife comes through
the door, he says, ”Listen, honey,
you know, your Mom... she got on
the roof...”
The table bursts into laughter. Even Billi and Jian chuckle,
despite having heard the joke a million times.
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sound of KEYS in the dark as Billi lets herself in. She’s
greeted by a LOUD CRASH - like a vase shattering. Billi drops
her mail, suddenly on guard. She’s scared, but ready to
defend herself.
Something FLIES overhead, knocking items off a shelf. Billi’s
eyes dart across the room, spotting the culprit.
A SMALL HOUSE BIRD on the windowsill. Billi’s eyes meet the
bird’s. Both parties are equally stunned. As she collects
herself, she realizes all the windows are closed.
BILLI
How'd you get in here?
The bird stares up with its beady eyes. Billi opens a window
to let it out. The traumatized bird doesn’t move.

7.
Billi’s phone buzzes.
NAI NAI (O.S.)
[Hi Billi. Sorry I hung up
earlier.]
BILLI
[That’s OK. What’s going on?]
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT - MORNING
INTERCUT BETWEEN BILLI AND NAI NAI FOR PHONE CONVERSATION
MR. LI (80’s) shuffles past Nai Nai carrying a THERMOS of
tea. Mr. Li is the kind of man that wears the same cap
indoors, outdoors, even at weddings.
NAI NAI
(genuine relief)
[Nothing, nothing. I’m OK. You
don’t have to worry, child.]
Nai Nai notices the trail of water following Mr. Li.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[It’s leaking!]
He’s oblivious. Nai Nai taps him, then shouts louder.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[It’s leaking!]
Mr. Li shuffles unhurriedly back into the kitchen.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[This old man! So careless!]
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Billi picks her mail off the ground.
BILLI
[You mean Mr. Li?]
NAI NAI
[I never should’ve gotten together
with him!]
Nai Nai!

BILLI

INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - MORNING
As Mr. Li wipes up the water -

8.
NAI NAI
[It’s OK, he’s going deaf. He can’t
hear me anyway.]
BILLI
[Why are you still with him?]
NAI NAI
(sighs)
[It’s been so many years. We get
by. Anyway, it’s better than living
alone. At least there’s a live body
in the house. Otherwise, when you
get up to go to the bathroom, all
you see are your own shadows.
Listen, do you have a friend yet,
my child?]
BILLI
[I um... I have lots of friends.
Nai Nai...]
NAI NAI
[I mean a special friend. I worry
about you on your own. In a big
place like New York.]
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - EVENING
Billi opens an envelope, pulls out a letter. A rejection from
the Guggenheim Foundation.
NAI NAI (O.S.)
[Billi? Is everything OK?]
She’s deflated, overwhelmed by the sense of failure.
BILLI
[I’m fine. I’m uh... I’m just
tired.]
And suddenly, she does seem tired. Spiritually, that is.
NAI NAI
[If you’re tired, go to bed!]
Billi nods to herself, too familiar with the way these things
get lost in translation.
OK...

BILLI

(beat)
I love you Nai Nai...

9.
NAI NAI
I lauf you, I lauf you!
These are the only words Nai Nai knows. As broken as they
sound, she says it with all her heart. Billi summons a weak
smile, just in case Nai Nai can hear her smile.
She looks back at the windowsill. It's empty. The bird is
gone.
EXT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - DAY
Billi marches out of her apartment holding an ENVELOPE. It’s
a new day. She enters the laundromat just downstairs from her
apartment.
INT. NEIGHBORHOOD LAUNDROMAT - DAY
Billi stands across from SHIRLEY (20’s), folding stacks of
laundry for customers. Her first-generation immigrant mother
attends to customers nearby. She is the LAUNDROMAT OWNER (and
landlord of the building).
LAUNDROMAT OWNER
(in another language)
Late again! She’s always late, and
she didn’t even pay last month!
Billi looks between Shirley and her mother, anxious.
BILLI
I wrote a couple pieces for this
stupid web company and they screwed
me on the payment, but look it’s
all here.
SHIRLEY
For what month?
BILLI
(confused)
This one? May?
SHIRLEY
And what happened to April’s rent?
My mom says you didn’t pay April
yet.
Billi is blind-sided as she realizes her error.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
You know if you moved out, we could
double the rent right now?

10.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD LAUNDROMAT - DAY
Billi steps outside, realizes she’s still holding her
laundry.
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME - DAY
Billi bursts through the door carrying the laundry.
BILLI
Ma! Ba! Hello?
JIAN
Shhh! What are you doing here?
BILLI
I’ve been calling, why didn’t you
guys pick up?
JIAN
We busy. Have you eaten? I’ll make
you some wontons.
As Jian heads to the kitchen, Billi heads into the laundry
room and puts clothes into the washer.
JIAN (CONT’D)
So what, you broke? That’s why you
come. I know you... You need money,
right?
Billi tries to deflect with humor.
BILLI
No, I just love an excuse to come
see you.
JIAN
What’s going to happen to you? Are
you always going to live like this?
BILLI
Poor but sexy? I hope so.
JIAN
Why you not save? You should change
your expensive lifestyle!
BILLI
Seriously, Mom. If you’re gonna
give me shit every time I come
home, I won’t come back anymore!

11.
JIAN
Lower your voice. Dad’s sleeping!
BILLI
It's six o’clock. What’s wrong with
him?
JIAN
Nothing. He’s just resting.
Is he OK?

BILLI

Jian turns away from Billi and grabs frozen wontons from the
freezer. Her body language is evasive.
JIAN
He’s fine. We just very busy.
BILLI
Doing what? What’s going on?
JIAN
(lets out a sigh)
Hao Hao’s getting married, so we
have to go to China.
BILLI
What? Since when? Didn’t he just
start dating this girl a few months
ago?
Jian doesn’t respond, intently focused on chopping scallions.
BILLI (CONT’D)
I can’t go to China right now, Mom.
JIAN
You don’t have to go.
BILLI
He’s my only cousin, shouldn’t I be
there?
JIAN
No one expects you to go.
Billi considers this suspiciously.
BILLI
You think he knocked her up?
Jian silently continues cooking.

12.
JIAN
How many wontons you want?
Um... Five.

BILLI

JIAN
Only five? That's not enough.
BILLI
Then make a dozen.
JIAN
I think ten's good.
Billi looks around - the house is eerily quiet. Something's
not right.
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Billi stares at the closed door. The light is on inside. She
knocks gently and opens the door.
INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Haiyan sits on the edge of the bed, facing away from Billi.
Dad?

BILLI

His stillness, his silence - it’s eerie.
BILLI (CONT’D)
What's wrong, Dad?
Nothing.

HAIYAN

BILLI
Did you and Mom get in a fight?
Haiyan fights back tears.
BILLI (CONT’D)
Have you been drinking?
More silence. Terror.
BILLI (CONT’D)
Can you please talk to me? You're
scaring me.
Billi looks up to see Jian at the door.

13.
BILLI (CONT’D)
What's going on?
More silence. Billi’s insides are shrieking.
BILLI (CONT’D)
(raises her voice)
Something's going on! Just tell me
what's going on!
JIAN
(dry, to-the-point)
Nai Nai's dying. She has lung
cancer. It's stage four.
Billi’s heart drops. She collapses onto the bed, sitting
beside her father.
BILLI
What? I just spoke to her, she
didn’t say anything...
JIAN
She doesn’t know yet.
Billi’s mind races.
BILLI
How long does she have?
JIAN
Doctor says three months, but you
never know. Could be faster.
Billi reels.
BILLI
I need to call her...
HAIYAN
No, Billi...
BILLI
I need to see her!
HAIYAN
You can't do that.
Haiyan puts aside his own grief momentarily. His words are
measured.

14.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
She doesn’t know... And the family
thinks it’s better not to tell her.
So you can’t say anything.
BILLI
I don’t understand. She needs to
know, right?
HAIYAN
There’s nothing they can do, so
everyone decided it’s better not to
tell her.
BILLI
Why is that better?
JIAN
Chinese people have a saying. When
people get cancer, they die...
Billi squints - what the fuck?
JIAN (CONT’D)
... it's not the cancer that kills
them. It's the fear.
BILLI
What about the wedding?
Jian joins her family on the bed.
JIAN
That was your Dad’s idea. If
everyone rushed back to see her
right now, she would wonder why.
BILLI
So you’re throwing a fake wedding
to lie to her?
HAIYAN
It’s an excuse for everybody to see
her.
BILLI
When were you planning on telling
me all of this?
We’re back to silence.

15.
BILLI (CONT’D)
(accusatory)
How could you let me find out like
this?
JIAN
(defensive)
How should I have told you? ‘Oh,
your grandma’s on the roof?'
This doesn’t get a laugh, but Jian wasn’t expecting one.
BILLI
I need to go see her...
You can’t.

HAIYAN

JIAN
Everyone thinks it’s better if you
don’t go. Look at you. You can’t
hide your emotions! Nai Nai will
know right away!
BILLI
I need to say goodbye. What if she
dies and I don’t get a chance to
say goodbye?
The very thought of this makes Billi break down. Tears stream
down her face.
JIAN
You can go later. If you go right
now you’ll give it away. You can’t
help it.
INT. SUBWAY, NYC - NIGHT
Billi stares out the window, past her own reflection, her
grief apparent. Her laundry bag sits beside her.
INT. FRIEND’S HOUSE, BROOKLYN - DAY
Lit candles on a birthday cake. Everyone sings ‘happy
birthday’ for their friend TONY. Billi’s mind is clearly
elsewhere, even as she sings along.
Her mother’s right - she’s no good at hiding her emotions.

16.
INT. NYC SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT
An ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN waits for her train across the
tracks on the opposite platform. As Billi watches her, she
fights back emotions.
As the train arrives, we see Billi’s grief transform into
determination. She knows she must go.
As the train whisks the elderly woman away...
INT. CHANGCHUN AIRPORT, CHINA - DAY
A sea of Chinese faces. The ceiling is low, the floors are a
glossy white marble. It takes a few moments before we spot
Billi in the crowd. CHINESE VOICES echo around her.
Billi gets shoved into a stranger. As a reflex, Billi says
‘I’m sorry’ in English. The stranger responds with a flurry
of Chinese. Billi reacts, trying to orient herself.
EXT. CHANGCHUN AIRPORT, CHINA - DAY
A group of TAXI HUSTLERS target Billi, invading her personal
space. They inundate her with questions: “Do you need a
taxi?” “Where are you going?”
INT. TAXI - DAY
Billi stares out the window. Construction cranes dot the
skyline, wide streets interrupted by the skeletal frames of
unfinished buildings.
INT. TAXI, ALLEY - DAY
The DRIVER honks repeatedly as he pulls down a narrow alley.
Pedestrians and rickshaw peddlers make way for the car to
pass.
EXT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - DAY
The taxi pulls up to a complex of PEACH BUILDINGS.
Billi gets out. She stares up at the looming building, not
sure she’s prepared for the challenge she’s about to face.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - DAY
Billi climbs the stairs. The narrow staircase is dimly lit by
a single bulb. She KNOCKS. We immediately hear barking. As
Billi waits, the automatic light goes off, leaving her in the
dark for a few brief moments.

17.
Mr. Li opens the door, letting out a shaft of cold
fluorescent light from inside the apartment.
MR. LI
[Who’s that?]
BILLI
[Mr. Li? It’s me, Billi.]
[Who?]

MR. LI

Mr. Li shouts his words, as one does when they’re losing
their hearing, and perhaps even their mind.
Billi!

BILLI

MR. LI
[Billi? What are you doing here?
Come in, come in!]
BILLI
(peering inside)
[Nai Nai?]
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
As Billi moves into the living room, everyone reacts. Nai
Nai, Haiyan, Jian.
There’s also UNCLE HAIBIN (early 60's), distinguished grey
with black-rimmed glasses. AUNTIE LING (60), quiet but
shrewd.
The pimple-faced and sheepish cousin is HAO HAO (early 20’s);
‘on the brink of tears’ is his eternal state of being. AIKO
is his sweet but confused Japanese bride.
NAI NAI
[Billi? Oh my god, Billi’s here!]
HAIYAN
Why'd you come?
LITTLE NAI NAI
[What are you doing here? We all
thought you weren’t coming!]
JIAN
How’d you get here?
They talk AT her, all at once. Nai Nai is the only one who
seems pleased by this surprise. In fact, she’s overjoyed.

18.
NAI NAI
[Billi! Billi! What are you doing
here you stupid child?]
Nai Nai approaches Billi, analyzing her.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Let me look at you. Oh you’re not
that skinny! Your Mom said you got
skinny, but you’re not that
skinny!]
Nai Nai embraces Billi. Billi’s throat swells shut. Her mouth
quivers as tears flood to her eyes.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Oh my granddaughter! Why didn’t
you tell me you were coming? I’ve
been trying to call you all week!]
A deer in headlights, Billi doesn’t speak, as if the secret
would spill out if she opened her mouth. Family members
observe her carefully, exchanging looks of concern.
Nai Nai kisses her all over her face. Billi fights for
control of her emotions.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Your mother said you were too busy
to come!]
Billi opens her mouth and still, nothing comes out.
Anticipation lingers in the air.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[What’s wrong with you? Why aren’t
you talking?]
Billi looks at her family, then back at Nai Nai. She swallows
hard. After a few long beats BILLI
[I missed you.]
NAI NAI
[Sure, but your work comes first.
You shouldn’t have come if you’re
so busy. How’d you get here? Did
you fly?]
Billi musters a smile.
BILLI
[No, I swam...]

19.
Nai Nai laughs and slaps her on the butt. The tension begins
to subside.
HAIYAN
You should’ve called.
Nai Nai pats Billi's butt as they all head back to the couch.
NAI NAI
[Silly child. This butt. This butt
never changes! I’ve always loved
this little round butt. Come sit!]
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
A meat pie fries in the pan. Jian is at the stove as MRS. GAO
(40’s) chops veggies and Little Nai Nai kneads dough.
Billi peers in and hugs Little Nai Nai.
BILLI
[Little Nai Nai...]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Billi! You must be starving. I'm
making your favorite - meat pies!
It's your favorite, right? I
remember it's your favorite.]
BILLI
[Looks great...]
As Mrs. Gao crosses.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Billi, this is Mrs. Gao.]
MRS. GAO
[You’re the granddaughter! You came
home too!]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Last time you were here, we still
had Ms. Jin, right?]
BILLI
[Ms. Jin? I remember Mrs. Ma?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Mrs. Ma was four maids ago! Has it
been that long since you’ve been
back?]

20.
Billi turns her attention to Jian, who stands over a frying
pan, giving her the cold shoulder. Billi bear hugs her mother
from behind.
JIAN
Stop fooling around! The oil's hot!
BILLI
Don’t be mad, Mom.
JIAN
How you buy ticket here? Credit
card, right?
BILLI
Don’t worry. It's all fine, Mom.
Look at my face. Look.
Billi gives her the widest possible smile. Jian stifles a
chuckle, too proud to give in. She feigns stoicism and shoves
a plate of meat pies into Billi's hands.
JIAN
Go put these on the table.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - NIGHT
The family eats, making small talk about the food. Billi
scans the table, watching everyone devour meat pies.
Nai Nai beams at the sight of the entire family around the
table.
NAI NAI
[It’s been far too long since we’ve
all been united like this.]
AUNTIE LING
[What's it been? 20 years?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Haiyan left China 25 years ago.
And you guys left for Japan soon
after.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[That's a long time.]
HAIYAN
[Time flies...]
Mrs. Gao comes out with a plate of piping hot meat pies.

21.
MRS. GAO
[These are hot. Eat these fresh
ones!]
NAI NAI
[Look at these two wonderful
grandchildren of mine!]
Nai Nai playfully touches Billi and Hao Hao.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[You see... my granddaughter is
very strong. Independent. Not
someone who just follows everyone
else.]
Billi swallows.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Hao Hao was always a sensitive
child, but look at him now. All
grown up and getting married! I’ve
been looking forward to this day
for a long time.]
AUNTIE LING
[Too bad neither of them speak
Chinese very well!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Hao Hao’s Chinese is fine. He’s
just being shy. Hao Hao, talk to
Nai Nai in Chinese!]
Everyone stares at Hao Hao. He reluctantly obeys, speaking
slowly in his broken Chinese.
HAO HAO
[Nai Nai... We don’t need a big
wedding banquet. We just came to
spend time with you.]
NAI NAI
[Don’t be ridiculous! You guys came
back home to get married. We must
have a proper wedding banquet.]
AUNTIE LING
[Let’s just keep it small. We don’t
need to go overboard.]

22.
NAI NAI
[Stop it! Everything’s already
booked and I sent out invitations
last week! My only grandson’s
getting married, we can’t look
cheap!]
Little Nai Nai picks at her food. Everyone turns their focus
to the food, chewing intently. Hao Hao is, quite reliably, on
the brink of tears.
Nai Nai suddenly notices Billi’s untouched meat pie.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
(accusatory)
[Why aren't you eating?]
Billi stares down at her plate, unable to work up an
appetite.
BILLI
[I’m not hungry.]
NAI NAI
[How can you not be hungry? You’ve
been traveling for 24 hours. Eat,
eat.]
Nai Nai picks up the meat pie and feeds it to Billi. Always a
child in her grandmother’s eyes, Billi takes a reluctant
bite.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Billi closes the door. She lets out a breath as she sits on
the toilet - a moment of refuge.
On the wall in front of her is a poster of a chubby, overly
cheerful baby. Underneath, in Chinese, it reads:
They all say I'm adorable.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Passing Nai Nai’s bedroom, Billi notices details of her
simple life: the neatly-made bed, framed photos of Billi
surround the room. In the next bedroom, Mr. Li shuffles
around loudly in his slippers. He hacks up a loogie.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - NIGHT
Billi returns to the table in a daze. Nai Nai turns to look
at her with concern.

23.
NAI NAI
[What’s wrong?]
The threat of being exposed lingers in the air.
[I’m fine.]

BILLI

UNCLE HAIBIN
[It's probably the jet-lag. Come,
I’ll take you to the hotel.]
BILLI
[Hotel? Why can't I stay here? I
always stay here.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[With so many people visiting, it's
easier if everyone stays at a
hotel. It’s very close.]
NAI NAI
[Don't worry, it's an excellent
hotel. It’s brand new.]
Billi swallows her disappointment.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Go get some rest. We have a lot to
do the next couple days before the
wedding.]
The family’s eyes linger on her, menacing.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD ALLEY - NIGHT
Billi and Uncle Haibin walk side by side in awkward silence.
They pass street vendors wrapped in smoke and incandescent
lighting, selling meat skewers off their grills.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Nai Nai is very sick, you know?]
He speaks in an eerily calm, matter-of-fact tone. Not sure if
the question is rhetorical, Billi answers.
[I know.]

BILLI

UNCLE HAIBIN
[Nai Nai herself doesn't know.
We're not going to tell her.]

24.
BILLI
[I know. Dad told me.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
(not listening)
[She doesn't have long left. We got
several opinions already. I also
spoke to a doctor in Japan. A
cancer specialist.]
Billi stares straight ahead, unengaged. This doesn’t deter
Uncle Haibin.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[I got her some medicine. It was
expensive.]
BILLI
(hopeful)
[From the Japanese doctor?]
UNCLE HAIBIN
(matter-of-factly)
[From the internet.]
Billi is at a loss for words. More awkward silence.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[Nai Nai... she loves you so much,
you know?]
[I know.]

BILLI

UNCLE HAIBIN
[You and Hao Hao spent every summer
with her and grandpa until you
moved to the US. But you were very
little then, so you probably don’t
remember.]
BILLI
[I remember.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[She doesn’t know. So you have to
be very careful not to tell her.]
It feels like he’s testing her. Billi’s patience wears thin.
She raises her voice.
BILLI
[I know! Dad already told me!]

25.
Like a broken record, Uncle Haibin’s tone remains consistent.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[She doesn’t know a thing.]
Billi relinquishes with a sigh. As they continue on, their
repetitious dialogue falls into pace with their walking.
[I know.]

BILLI

UNCLE HAIBIN
[We’re not planning on telling
her.]
[I know.]

BILLI

UNCLE HAIBIN
[No matter how sad you feel, you
cannot say anything.]
Billi stares ahead as they head into a brightly lit
commercial district.
[I know.]

BILLI

INT. HOTEL BEST, LOBBY - NIGHT
Billi and Uncle Haibin stand across from MICHAEL (late 20's),
the hotel manager.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[What do you mean the elevator
broke? Isn't this a newly opened
hotel?]
MICHAEL
[We're working on it. Come come,
I'll carry this.]
A group of lively BUSINESSMEN and MISTRESSES walk in. Billi
studies them - clearly in the hotel for a different reason.
BUSINESSMAN #1
[We want the same room as last
time.]
MICHAEL
[I'll check for you.]
Michael finds their key for them.

26.
UNCLE HAIBIN
(to Billi)
[You're OK, right? I'm gonna head
back. Get some sleep.]
Billi nods and he leaves.
INT. HOTEL BEST, STAIRS - NIGHT
Billi follows Michael upstairs. Several flights later, she
stops to catch her breath.
BILLI
[Are we almost there?]
MICHAEL
[Almost there! It's not much
higher.]
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
[Are you visiting from abroad?]
[Yes.]

BILLI

MICHAEL
[From where?]
[America.]

BILLI

MICHAEL
[America? You don't look American.]
This makes Billi pause, but she’s used to it.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
[What are you here for?]
Billi debates which answer to give him. She decides on the
lie.
BILLI
[A wedding.]
MICHAEL
(beat)
[Who’s getting married?]
BILLI
[My...] cousin.
(remembers the Chinese)
‘Tang di.’

27.
MICHAEL
[Oh your cousin. He’s also from
America?]
BILLI
[No, they live in Japan.]
INT. HOTEL BEST, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Michael lets Billi into her room.
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S ROOM - NIGHT
Billi surveys the room as Michael drops off her bag.
MICHAEL
[Japan?! What are they doing in
Japan?]
BILLI
[I don’t know. My uncle’s an
artist. He paints.]
The odd-patterned carpet, the strange paintings, the
wallpaper - it all clashes, yet somehow, it works.
MICHAEL
[And what does your father do in
America?]
BILLI
[He’s a translator, do you have
water? For drinking?]
MICHAEL
[You can use the boiler.]
Michael points to an ELECTRIC BOILER.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
[So tell me, what’s better? China
or America?]
BILLI
[Uh... they’re different.]
Billi tries to usher him towards the door, but he continues
to linger.
MICHAEL
[What do you mean different? It
must be much nicer over there.]

28.
BILLI
[It’s just... I don’t know,
different.]
MICHAEL
[But you’re probably more used to
America, right?]
BILLI
[I guess...]
She continues to inch him out the door.
MICHAEL
[Well let me know if you need
anything else.]
BILLI
[K thanks. Bye.]
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S ROOM - LATER
Billi fills the boiler. She sits on the edge of the bed,
literally waiting for the water to boil.

HA!

NAI NAI (O.S.)
(prelap)

EXT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - MORNING
Nai Nai swings her arms, hitting herself all over her body.
Her face beams, her eyes sparkle. She’s full of life and
Billi seems like a drag in comparison.
NAI NAI
[Come Billi! Do it with me! It’s
good for you!]
Billi does a weak imitation of Nai Nai’s exercise.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[No, stronger. HA! It clears out
all the bad toxins. Then you
inhale, take in lots of fresh
oxygen. HA! You do it. You also
have to slap yourself to get the
circulation going.
(demonstrates slapping)
Slap your arms. Slap your legs.
Slap your back like this... Try
it!]

29.
Humoring her grandmother, Billi obeys her orders and laughs
at herself. For a moment, she forgets the circumstances of
her visit.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Good! Bigger! From your gut.]
For a moment, they revel in the joy of slapping and shouting.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - MORNING
Nai Nai’s knuckles turn white from her grip on the railing,
pulling herself up one step at a time.
It pains Billi to see this. She tries to help.
NAI NAI
[I’m alright, I got it. I come down
by myself every morning.]
BILLI
[Doesn’t that hurt your legs?]
NAI NAI
[Even so, I have to come down to
exercise. It’s the reason I’m so
healthy. Even at my age!]
Billi swallows, unable to contradict her.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - MORNING
Billi and Mrs. Gao set out Chinese breakfast foods.
The door bell rings and Chen YuPing (40’s) waltzes in. (We’ll
refer to her as GU GU, which is Chinese for Aunt). She has
the hip confident style of someone much younger and exudes an
attitude of success.
GU GU
[Billi! I heard you came!]
Gu Gu's son LITTLE BAO (8) trails in behind her, playing on
his iPhone. Bao is what the Chinese call a little emperor pampered and well-fed.
GU GU (CONT’D)
[You remember Bao, right? Bao! Say
hi to the big sister!]
BILLI
[Little Bao, you've gotten so big!]

30.
BAO
(barks)
[It's not Little Bao! I’m just
called Bao!]
Nai Nai calls everyone to attention.
NAI NAI
[Alright, alright hurry up and eat
breakfast! We have a big day
ahead!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Have you taken your pills?]
NAI NAI
[I'll take them later.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[You have to remember to take them
every day, or there's no point!
Where are they?]
NAI NAI
[Next to my bed. Come you guys! Eat
before the food gets cold!]
AUNTIE LING
[Ma, you sit!]
As everyone finally takes their seat NAI NAI
[OK, listen to me all of you. I
know everyone's excited to see me,
but let's not forget why we're all
here.]
Furtive glances around the table. Nai Nai gestures to Hao Hao
and Aiko.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[The wedding is the big event.]
As if they really had forgotten, they all nod a little too
enthusiastically.
HAIYAN
(mutters unconvincingly)
[Yes... that's right. The wedding
is the big event.]

31.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
As Jian helps Mrs. Gao clean up, Nai Nai sidles up to her.
NAI NAI
[Jian, something's off about Haiyan
on this trip. Have you noticed? His
face is all puffy and discolored.
He seems very unhappy.]
JIAN
[He's fine, Ma.]
NAI NAI
[He just looks so tired. Is he
still drinking? You can’t let him
drink. Alcohol can ruin a person. I
know so many men around here who
have drank themselves to death.]
JIAN
[He barely drinks at home anymore.]
NAI NAI
[Is everything OK between you two?]
JIAN
[Everything's fine. We're fine.]
NAI NAI
[I know you guys have had your
issues in the past...]
JIAN
(defensive)
[It's got nothing to do with us.
We're doing great!]
NAI NAI
[You shouldn’t have him work so
much. It’s too much pressure for
one person to support your entire
family...]
Was that a jab at her?
JIAN
[I told him to close the office and
retire, but he refuses! He feels
useless at home if he has nothing
to do. He loves being surrounded by
people who need him - clients
always coming to him...
(MORE)

32.
JIAN (CONT'D)
oh Mr. Wang, help me with this,
help me with that.]
NAI NAI
(nods)
[Well it’s also good to have
something to do. Being idle can be
bad for your health. He just
doesn’t know how to take care of
himself. You have to think about
him more. Give him lots of
medicine. Let’s put it this way if he’s not well, you can’t live
well either. Right?]
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, DINING TABLE - MORNING
As Nai Nai rejoins the table, she clocks Haiyan again.
Something’s definitely not right.
Uncle hands her a couple pills. Nai Nai clocks Billi’s
concerned look.
NAI NAI
[They're just vitamins. Your uncle
bought them from Japan. He says
they’re expensive so they must be
good. Japanese people know how to
take care of themselves!]
Mr. Li gets up from the table silently.
AUNTIE LING
[Uncle Li, you’re done eating?]
NAI NAI
[Don’t mind him. That’s how he is!
He eats and leaves. He doesn’t care
about anything that doesn’t concern
him!]
Mr. Li is immune to Nai Nai’s insults. Nai Nai tries to serve
food. Everyone yells: Sit down! Serve yourself! Hurry up and
eat!
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[I want to talk to you all about
something. If anyone asks, none of
you are to say that Hao Hao and his
bride have only been dating three
months.]

33.
AUNTIE LING
[Ma, I already told you, Aiko's not
pregnant.]
NAI NAI
[Doesn’t matter! You know how
people think! I don’t want
everybody talking behind our backs.
If anyone asks, just say they’ve
been dating 6 months.]
JIAN
(sarcastic)
[Why not just say a year then?]
NAI NAI
[Good idea. A year sounds better.
The wedding banquet is in three
days. We have so much to do. I need
someone to come see the banquet
hall with me.]
[I’ll go.]

BILLI

NAI NAI
[You don’t need to come. You won’t
be much help anyway.]
HAIYAN
[Ma, I can come.]
NAI NAI
[No you need to rest! Look at your
face - it’s not right!]
HAIBIN
[Why don’t you stay home and rest,
Ma? I’ll go check on the banquet
hall.]
NAI NAI
[You don’t even know who to talk
to! I have to go myself.]
BILLI
[What can I do, Nai Nai?]
NAI NAI
[Nothing. You don’t look great
either, must still be the jet lag.]

34.
GU GU
[What if I take them to the massage
parlor?]
NAI NAI
[That’s a great idea!]
BILLI
[Nai Nai I want to come with you.]
NAI NAI
[No, you guys go relax. You better
not get sick before the wedding!]
Nai Nai piles more food on Billi's plate, then shoves a
doughy cruller in her own mouth.
INT. GRAND HOTEL, BANQUET HALL - DAY
Nai Nai and Uncle Haibin stand across from the WEDDING
COORDINATOR in an empty banquet hall. Nai Nai is visibly
upset.
NAI NAI
[It’s not right! I ordered meal set
one! When I booked the wedding, you
guys told me meal set one would
come with lobster. That’s what you
said. Now you act like you don’t
know anything about it?]
WEDDING COORDINATOR
[I really don’t know anything about
that. I was told it’s crab, but I
can check with the chef.
(screams)
Little Ping! Little Ping!]
LITTLE PING, a young cook dressed in a tall chef’s hat wakes
from a nap at a nearby table.
WEDDING COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
[Go get the chef!]
Little Ping drags himself into the kitchen.
WEDDING COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
[Why don’t you look at the alcohol
options in the meantime. We have
baijiu, red wine, white wine,
beer...]
NAI NAI
[We also have champagne.]

35.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Champagne? What champagne?]
NAI NAI
[Your brother brought it! He didn’t
tell you? He got several cases!
It’s from France. Looks very nice
and expensive!]
Something about this rubs Uncle Haibin the wrong way.
UNCLE HAIBIN
(frowning)
[Chinese people aren’t accustomed
to drinking champagne! Get the
baijiu.]
The BANQUET CHEF approaches WEDDING COORDINATOR
[Chef, Mrs. Zhao says she was told
that meal set one would include
lobster, not crab.]
BANQUET CHEF
[It’s crab, not lobster.]
NAI NAI
[What kind of scam is this? It’s
three days before the wedding, we
already paid a deposit and you make
this kind of a change without
telling us!]
BANQUET CHEF
[I don’t know anything about that.
I was told we’re serving crab.]
Agitated, Nai Nai coughs and collapses onto a chair. Uncle
Haibin rushes to her side.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Ma! Don’t get all worked up, crab
is great!]
NAI NAI
[I’m fine. I just need to rest a
moment.]
INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, LOBBY - DAY
Numb with anguish, Billi and Haiyan sit waiting, dressed in
oversized spa pajamas.

36.
HAIYAN
So what’s going on with the
fellowship?
Nothing.

BILLI

HAIYAN
You still haven’t heard anything?
No.

BILLI

HAIYAN
When are they going to let you
know?
BILLI
(irritated)
I don’t know Dad!
HAIYAN
How’s your money? Can you afford
this trip? Do you need help?
I’m fine.

BILLI

Before Billi can continue, Gu Gu approaches, also in pajamas.
She’s accompanied by a MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST.
GU GU
[All set, let’s go.]
INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, HALLWAY - DAY
Billi, Gu Gu and Haiyan walk down the hallway.
HAIYAN
[Sis, you’re too generous.]
GU GU
[You’re family. It’s so rare for
you guys to come home. Let’s just
all relax so we can be happy in
front of Nai Nai.]
MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
[What kind of treatment would you
like, ‘mei nu’?]
Gu Gu clocks Billi’s confusion.

37.
GU GU
[She’s from America. Her Chinese
isn’t great. Just give her the full
body massage.]
MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
[Cupping too?]
GU GU
[The whole package.]
MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
[You want the same thing, ‘mei
nu’?]
GU GU
[I don’t need cupping.]
Gu Gu speaks too fast for Billi to understand. She turns to
her father for a translation BILLI
What’s ‘mei nu’?
HAIYAN
It means ‘beauty’.
GU GU
[Always beauty, beauty. They call
everyone that in China these days.
Old or young, beautiful or ugly,
everyone’s a beauty! It’s so
stupid.]
The MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST turns to Haiyan.
MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
[Sir, what about you?]
HAIYAN
(jokes)
[Oh you can call me beauty. I don’t
mind.]
MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
(doesn’t crack a smile)
[I meant what kind of treatment
would you like, sir? May I
recommend our bath and massage
package? The tub is filled with
herbs and you can soak in it.]
Gu Gu and Billi watch Haiyan. He's indecisive.

38.
HAIYAN
(to Gu Gu)
[What do you think?]
GU GU
[Why are you asking me? It's your
massage! Do you want to soak in a
tub?]
Haiyan contemplates this carefully, as if the right treatment
might cure his grief.
HAIYAN
[Can you show me the tub?]
The receptionist leads Haiyan down the corridor.
INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, MASSAGE ROOM - DAY
Billi paces anxiously. Gu Gu clocks this and tries to cheer
her up.
GU GU
(teasing)
[Hey Billi. Do you know why they
separated your Dad from us?]
[Why?]

BILLI

GU GU
[You really don’t know?]
[What?]

BILLI

GU GU
(smirks)
['Hit the airplane'.]
BILLI
[Hit the airplane?]
GU GU
[You don't know this phrase? You’re
not married yet. I shouldn’t tell
you this stuff.]
BILLI
[What’s it mean?]
Gu Gu covertly demonstrates a jerking-off motion, giggling.

39.
GU GU
[You know, it shoots so high he
could hit an airplane!]
Despite herself, Billi laughs. Haiyan appears at the doorway.
HAIYAN
[The bath looks nice. I think I'll
do that.]
Billi and Gu Gu burst out laughing.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
(confused)
What happened?
INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, MASSAGE ROOM - LATER
Lying on her stomach, Billi stares down at the masseuse's
feet in nylon stockings inside white pumps. She cringes as
the masseuse lights a cup on fire and places it on her back.
BILLI
[It hurts! Gu Gu, you said it was a
massage.]
BILLI’S MASSEUSE
[A little pain is normal. Otherwise
it doesn’t work. Just relax.]
Billi turns to Gu Gu, who’s absorbed in her cell phone while
getting a foot massage.
BILLI
[Gu Gu... Don’t you think we should
tell Nai Nai?]
Gu Gu’s attention stays on her phone.
GU GU
[Tell her? What for?]
BILLI
[What if she has things she wants
to take care of?]
GU GU
(matter-of-factly)
[She doesn’t have anything like
that... Ow!]
Gu Gu yanks her foot back from the masseuse.

40.
GU GU (CONT’D)
[That hurt, what was that?]
GU GU’S MASSEUSE
[That’s your stress point. Have you
been anxious lately? You must try
to relax.]
BILLI
[But... what if she wants to say
goodbye?]
GU GU
[Say goodbye? That’s so painful!
What’s the point of that?]
Billi winces with pain, her entire back covered with cups. Gu
Gu seems very pragmatic and matter-of-fact.
GU GU (CONT’D)
[You see her for yourself. She
seems fine, right? Just like a
normal person...]
Billi realizes this is valid.
GU GU (CONT’D)
[If you tell her, you’ll ruin her
good mood.]
Billi considers this.
INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 1 - DAY
Aiko and Hao Hao pose in front of a backdrop, dressed in
elaborate wedding attire. They're as stiff as the plastic
bride and groom toppers on a cake.
A PHOTOGRAPHER adjusts the couple's positions.
PHOTOGRAPHER
[Get a little closer. Even closer.]
The cake toppers don’t know where to put their hands. It’s
all very forced and awkward.
NAI NAI
[Get closer! What's wrong with this
girl? Can't you look like a normal
couple in love?]
Nai Nai instructs Aiko sternly in Chinese. (Aiko doesn’t
understand Chinese).

41.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Put your head on his shoulder. Put
your hand around her. And smile!]
Aiko looks to Hao Hao for a translation, but he’s too busy
figuring out how to smile. Nai Nai directs her disapproving
look to Billi.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[That girl is so unaffectionate.
Nothing like our family. I have to
yell at her just to hug him or put
her cheek against his! Makes me
wonder what they do in the bedroom
when I'm not there!]
BILLI
[She seems really sweet, Nai Nai.]
NAI NAI
[I don’t like her. She’s dumb. She
doesn’t understand anything!]
BILLI
[She doesn’t understand, because
she doesn’t speak Chinese...]
NAI NAI
[No, it’s because she’s dumb.]
On cue, something on set falls, making Aiko trip. Everyone
reacts.
Against the chaos of the photo shoot, Nai Nai calmly shifts
her attention to her granddaughter. Billi is clearly the
better bride in her eyes - if only she’d find someone to
marry.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Look at you. Smart. Beautiful. You
should have someone take care of
you.]
BILLI
[I take care of myself, Nai Nai.]
INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 2 - DAY
The conversation is seamless, but in the background, the
bride and groom pose against a different backdrop.

42.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[You’re still young. But as you get
older, it’s good for you to have
someone to take care of you.]
BILLI
[Does Mr. Li take care of you?]
Nai Nai looks away. She takes a beat before answering.
NAI NAI
[It’s also good to be independent.
A woman needs to be selfsufficient.]
The woman’s got a response to everything. Billi laughs as Nai
Nai presses her cheek against Billi’s.
Meanwhile, on set, Aiko stumbles in her impossibly high heels
and Auntie Ling rushes to her assistance.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Stupid child. You are too lovable.
I’ll never forget when your parents
brought you to my house the summer
before you turned two. You were so
small, so skinny. You had that
horrible nanny who stole your eggs
and she’d take you all over the
city and only feed you popsicles.
Do you remember this?]
Billi shakes her head.
BILLI
[Why did she steal my eggs?]
NAI NAI
[Eggs were rationed back then. Your
parents saved theirs so you could
have at least one a day.]
INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 3 - DAY
Billi considers this sacrifice, internalizing the complicated
mix of love and guilt.
NAI NAI
[You poor thing, I felt so bad for
you. You had terrible digestion,
from too much dampness trapped
inside, so you’d have diarrhea all
the time, everywhere... all over
the floor.]

43.
BILLI
[I’m sorry I pooped on your floor.]
And she does seem sorry. Behind her, the young couple hold up
flutes of fake champagne for a photo.
NAI NAI
[It wasn’t your fault! I told your
mother to leave you with me so I
could fix you. Spending that year
with me, you became fatter, the
color returned to your cheeks.]
BILLI
[You fixed me!]
NAI NAI
[You were just a happy child.
Everyone loved you. You were so
open, always smiling. My child,
there’s been so much going on this
trip, we haven’t been able to talk
much.]
On cue again, a LOST BRIDE waddles onto set from a back door.
Suddenly, there are two brides against the backdrop, causing
momentary confusion. The BRIDE HANDLER immediately pulls her
back out, apologizing.
Nai Nai is unfazed by all this, her attention fixed on Billi.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[This event is very important.
There will be a lot of relatives
and friends who haven’t seen you
since you were little. I know you
have a lot on your mind, but you
must still be generous in spirit.
Be courteous!]
INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 4 - DAY
Nai Nai takes Billi's hand as they walk through a Garden of
Eden setting. They walk past fake tropical trees and a random
peacock.
NAI NAI
[When you see people, you should
loudly say 'hello auntie! Hello
uncle!' Don't be 'nio nio ne ne'.]
BILLI
[’Nio nio ne ne?’]

44.
NAI NAI
[You don't know ‘nio nio ne ne’?
You know... like this...]
Nai Nai demonstrates the phrase comically. Billi chuckles.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[That's 'nio nio ne ne'. Very
selfish, closed off. Nobody likes
that kind of person. Promise me.]
BILLI
OK...[I promise.]
Nai Nai affectionately pats her butt.
NAI NAI
[When you get married, I'll throw
you an even bigger wedding
banquet!]
We stay on Billi’s face as this lands on her.
INT. RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
The entire family gathers around a large round table covered
with food. There are a few new family members including GU FU
(Gu Gu’s husband) and two cousins - SUN AO (early 40’s) and
his wife NICO.
Gu Gu pours beer for everyone.
GU GU
[Come, let’s toast. Welcome home,
welcome home! How rare it is for us
all to be together. Just look at
your mother’s face...]
Everyone raises their glass and drinks. Sun Ao gleefully
refills for everyone.
HAIYAN
[Sis, thank you for everything...]
Gu Fu dismisses him playfully with a wave.
GU FU
[We’re all one family. No need to
talk about thanks. Come on, let’s
all drink.]

45.
SUN AO
[Let’s see who can handle their
alcohol better, Americans or
Chinese!]
Uncle Haibin lights up a cigarette. As he offers one to
Haiyan, Billi intercepts BILLI
[My dad quit.]
[Really?]

UNCLE HAIBIN

Uncle Haibin looks at Haiyan in disbelief and Haiyan avoids
eye contact.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
(to Billi)
[I don’t think so. I think he just
told you that.]
Sun Ao sees that Nai Nai didn’t finish her beer.
SUN AO
[Auntie, don’t think you’re
excused! You also have to gan bei!]
Nai Nai laughs, and nods. She makes a show of emptying her
glass. Her family cheers.
NICO
[Hey Billi, you ever think about
moving back to China? A lot of
foreigners are moving here to make
money now!]
GU GU
[How long would it take to make a
million dollars in America?]
BILLI
[Um... a long time.]
GU GU
[Really? It’s very easy in China.]
BILLI
[Money is not the most important.
There are lots of things that money
can’t buy.]

46.
NAI NAI
[Look at my granddaughter! She’s so
wise!]
GU GU
[But if you get rich, first you buy
the things money CAN buy. Then you
can also enjoy the free stuff money
can't buy!]
Jian is triggered by this.
JIAN
[YuPing, if you can get rich in
China, then why are you planning to
send Bao to America for college?]
GU GU
[For more opportunity...]
JIAN
[What kind of opportunity? Moneymaking opportunity? After studying
in America, maybe Bao also won’t
care about money. Just like Billi.
She’s got different values.]
BILLI
Mom, can you not talk about me?
GU GU
(trying to make peace)
[You guys don’t have to worry. When
she becomes a big famous writer,
she can make big money. You’re
investing in her talent!]
JIAN
[So raising a kid is like playing
the stock market?]
BILLI
(to Dad)
What’s that mean?
HAIYAN
They’re saying you’re a stock
investment and you’ll make us rich.
JIAN
But I can’t expect that from you,
right? You’re a losing stock.
Jian smiles at her own joke, but Billi isn’t amused.

47.
HAIYAN
[These American kids are only
concerned with their own dreams.]
SUN AO
[Nowadays, Chinese kids are that
way too!]
JIAN
[But in America, they actually have
the freedom to pursue their dreams.
Doesn’t matter if you’re rich or
poor, everyone has the same
opportunities.]
BILLI
You’re kidding right? You think
everyone in America has equal
opportunity?
JIAN
[You know, the first year we moved
to America, our friend Henry
introduced us to an American
church. The first time we went, we
were really nervous, didn’t
understand anything. After the
service, we walked past the piano
and Billi stood in front of it,
staring. She reached her hand out
and Haiyan stopped her. The pastor
came over to introduce herself.
Haiyan explained to the pastor that
Billi used to study piano in China.
She stopped after we moved and
really missed it. We couldn’t
afford it. The pastor didn’t say
anything, but came back moments
later and handed me a key. She
said, “This key opens every door on
this property. Come anytime and
Billi can play the piano.”]
NAI NAI
[Really? They really did that?]
JIAN
[I didn’t speak English so I
thought I misunderstood and Haiyan
translated for me. I almost started
crying.]

48.
HAIYAN
[They even got her a piano teacher
for free.]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Look at that. That would never
happen in China. America really is
different, huh?]
NICO
[But China has China’s benefits!
We’re not totally useless.]
JIAN
[Yea, the roast duck is still
delicious!]
Jian’s the only one laughing at her own joke again.
BILLI
Mom. That one church is not
representative of all of America.
We have so many problems healthcare, guns, public
education...
JIAN
(suddenly defensive)
If you think China’s better, then
why don’t you move here?
NAI NAI
[That’s enough. You listen to me!
You can't go around criticizing
your motherland. Don't any of you
forget that you're still Chinese!]
HAIYAN
(jokingly)
[Well, technically, we're
American.]
The Chinese family all glare at him.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
(nervous smile)
[I just mean that we're American
citizens now. We hold American
passports.]
NAI NAI
[That’s just a piece of paper. The
blood in your veins is still
Chinese!]

49.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[I'll always be Chinese. No matter
where I live or what passport I
hold.]
GU GU
[You all think the moon outside of
China is rounder, but do you ever
think about your mother? Having to
grow old without her kids around.]
Haiyan and Haibin both grow quiet with guilt.
NAI NAI
[OK OK, enough! Everyone’s home,
let’s talk about happy things!]
Jian’s got a bone to pick and she just won’t let it go.
JIAN
[But YuPing, you say you still plan
on sending Bao out of the country
for college?]
GU GU
[He won’t stay there. He’ll come
back.]
JIAN
[You can’t guarantee that.]
Gu Gu knows that Jian’s right.
JIAN (CONT’D)
[But even with the risk that he
won’t return, you’d still send him
out, right?]
Gu Gu swallows. The table is silent as everyone chews
intently. Food is always there to fill the awkward spaces.
Sun Ao tries to change the subject.
SUN AO
[So um... how’s your piano Billi?]
BILLI
[I don’t play anymore.]
What little air remains in the room is sucked out.
INT. HOTEL BEST, HALLWAY - NIGHT
A long hallway. The entire family marches back to their
rooms, one after another. Billi lags behind.

50.
Smoke lingers out of an open door in the hallway and she
peers inside. A group of drunk middle-aged men smoke around a
mahjong table, a few of them shirtless.
Billi watches the women around them. One SEXY WOMAN catches
Billi’s gaze. Their eyes lock, each caught by the other in
their performative act.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Little Nai Nai, Mr. Li and Nai Nai walk through the front
door. Nai Nai is coughing. Mrs. Gao attends to her.
NAI NAI
[Go home, I’m fine.]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[You’re coughing a lot.]
NAI NAI
[It’s probably the flu. I’ll be
fine. Don’t mention it to anyone, I
don’t want them to worry.]
Little Nai Nai nods.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Go on. Go upstairs. I’m fine.]
Little Nai Nai grapples quietly with the consequences of her
lie. With no other choice, she leaves.
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI'S ROOM - NIGHT
Billi takes her shirt off and examines her back in the
mirror. It's covered with large round purple welts from the
"ba guan" (cupping).
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S ROOM - MORNING
Billi wakes to voices echoing through the hallway. She opens
her eyes to find a SMALL HOUSE BIRD on the windowsill. It
looks just like the one that got stuck in her apartment.
Her eyes meet the bird’s. What does it mean? Shouting
continues in the hallway and she gets up to investigate.
INT. HOTEL BEST, CORRIDOR - MORNING
As Billi steps out of her room, Uncle Haibin rushes past.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Hurry up, I’ll meet you
downstairs!]

51.
Billi turns to see Haiyan getting dressed.
HAIYAN
[Do you know how to get there?]
Uncle Haibin holds his cell phone as Little Nai Nai’s voice
shouts through the speakerphone.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[It’s building 8!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[OK auntie, I’ll figure it out.
Just get over there and we’ll meet
you!]
Billi looks back and forth, caught in the middle of this
crossfire.
BILLI
[What’s going on?]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Nai Nai went to the hospital.]
Hao Hao steps out of his room, still half asleep.
BILLI
What happened?!
HAIYAN
I don’t know.
Billi’s heart sinks as she and Hao Hao lock eyes.
EXT. NANHU BRIDGE - MORNING
Billi, Hao Hao, Haiyan and Uncle Haibin are lost as they
frantically try to orient themselves.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, EXAM ROOM - MORNING
Nai Nai sits on the exam table with Mrs. Gao by her side. As
Billi, Haiyan, Hao Hao and Uncle Haibin rush in, Nai Nai
scrunches her face in annoyance.
NAI NAI
[Why did you all come?]
She turns to Little Nai Nai.

52.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[You told them? I told you not to
say anything! You didn’t need to
come!]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[You come to the hospital by
yourself while your sons are all
here! If something happened and I
didn’t tell them, they’d blame me!]
NAI NAI
[I didn’t come alone. Mrs. Gao
brought me!]
HAIYAN
[Ma, you can’t just disappear
without telling any of us!]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[I’ll go see where the doctor
is...]
As Little Nai Nai opens the door to leave, a group of doctors
rush past with a stretcher, another reminder of what’s around
the corner.
Nai Nai clocks the fear in Billi’s eyes.
NAI NAI
[I’m fine! I just came to pick up
some medicine. It’s not a big
deal!]
Billi takes a seat beside Nai Nai. She takes her hand as the
rest of the family looks on.
BILLI
[What medicine?]
NAI NAI
[I have this lingering cough from
the last time I had a cold. I just
wanted to see if there’s better
antibiotics to help me heal
faster.]
Billi grasps Nai Nai’s hand, brings it to her face. She takes
in the scent of her grandmother’s skin, the feel of it on her
face. She kisses Nai Nai’s hand.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[I’m fine my child.]

53.
The words sit on the tip of Billi’s tongue. She knows she
needs to tell her the truth.
BILLI
[You’re not. Nai Nai...]
NAI NAI
[You don’t need to worry about me.
Anyway, I’m 80 years old. I’ve
lived a long life. I’m not scared
and you don’t have to be scared for
me. I just want you to be
successful and have a good life and
I’ll be satisfied. I know you’re
worried, but I’m OK. Don’t worry.
I’m fine.]
Before Billi can say anything else, Little Nai Nai enters
with the young handsome DOCTOR SONG.
DOCTOR SONG
[Mrs. Zhao. Let’s have a look.]
He’s on autopilot, going through the motions of a routine
exam. Little Nai Nai holds her breath.
DOCTOR SONG (CONT’D)
[Breathe, breathe, cough. You have
some infection...]
NAI NAI
[I’m already on antibiotics but
it’s not working! You gave me bad
medicine. You have to change it.
Give me a better one so I can feel
better!]
Nai Nai gestures to Hao Hao.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[This is my grandson, he’s getting
married in two days!]
DOCTOR SONG
[Ah. Congratulations.]
NAI NAI
[Everyone came back for the
wedding! This is my granddaughter.
She’s from America.]
Doctor Song’s eyes widen with excitement as he turns his
focus to Billi. He switches to English.

54.
DOCTOR SONG
Oh, you visit from America! I went
to school many years in the UK.
BILLI
Oh. Cool. That's um...
DOCTOR SONG
Where do you live?
New York...

BILLI

DOCTOR SONG
I always want to visit New York
City. Very beautiful city.
BILLI
It is... but listen... Do you know
about my grandmother’s condition?
Haiyan clocks what’s going on.
HAIYAN
Billi, don’t...
NAI NAI
[What are you guys talking about?]
Billi smiles broadly for Nai Nai’s sake.
BILLI
[Oh Nai Nai, he studied in England
so he speaks English!]
[Really?]

NAI NAI

DOCTOR SONG
[It's true.]
Nai Nai smiles at Dr. Song, clearly having her own agenda.
NAI NAI
[Doctor Song, let me ask you. Are
you married?]
DOCTOR SONG
(blushes)
[Not yet.]

55.
NAI NAI
[So handsome. A doctor. And you
speak English. Not married?
Impossible!]
Billi switches back to English. Nai Nai watches them,
clueless.
BILLI
How bad is she? Tell me the truth.
DOCTOR SONG
The cancer is quite advanced.
BILLI
Don’t you think you should tell
her?
DOCTOR SONG
It’s complicated. In her situation,
most families in China wouldn’t
tell her. When my grandmother had
cancer, my family also didn’t tell
her.
Billi registers this with surprise.
BILLI
Don’t you think it’s wrong to lie?
DOCTOR SONG
It’s not really a lie if it’s meant
for good.
BILLI
It’s still a lie.
DOCTOR SONG
It’s a good lie.
Billi doesn’t understand the idea of his good lie. Good for
what?
BILLI
And how’s your grandmother?
DOCTOR SONG
She passed away. A few months after
she was diagnosed.
This affects Billi, but Haiyan also registers this.

56.
DOCTOR SONG (CONT’D)
(to Nai Nai)
[Mrs. Zhao, you had pneumonia a few
months ago so I’m thinking this
could be some residual infection in
your lungs from that. We should do
an X-ray to make sure the infection
isn’t spreading.]
NAI NAI
[That’s not necessary! I just came
in to change my medicine. Can’t you
just give me a better brand of
antibiotics?]
DOCTOR SONG
[We can change your medicine, but
just as a precaution, let’s do an xray.]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Sis, since you insisted on coming
and you’re already here just do the
X-ray!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[You heard him, Ma. It’s just
precautionary.]
Nai Nai looks to Haiyan for his opinion. He diverts his gaze
to the ground.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL - DAY
Nai Nai sits alone in a hospital gown awaiting her X-ray. She
has a coughing fit.
INT. THE PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY
Haiyan paces back and forth, carefully considering his words.
HAIYAN
[Maybe it’s time we tell her.]
Everyone looks up, as if betrayed.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
[And we make some plans... like
who’s going to come back to stay
with her when she’s sick.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[We can make plans without telling
her.]

57.
Haiyan lets out a conflicted sigh.
HAIYAN
[It’s just... in America, we would
not make this kind of decision. We
couldn’t, really.]
BILLI
[It’d be...]
(switches to English)
Illegal. How do you say illegal?
HAIYAN
[Illegal. In America, this is
illegal.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[This isn’t America.]

LITTLE NAI NAI
[I recommend...it’s not time
yet.]

BILLI
[How do you know?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[I just know.]
BILLI
[Don’t you think she’d be furious
if she found out that we all knew
and were keeping it from her?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[How can she be mad when she did
the same thing herself?]
BILLI
[What do you mean?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[When your grandfather had cancer,
your Nai Nai lied to him too. It
wasn’t until he was very close to
the end that she finally told him.
She said, “Old timer, you have the
same disease that took our prime
minister.” He died three days
later.]
BILLI
[So she did tell him.]

58.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Yes, in the end she told him. She
thought it’d be cruel to let him
leave this world without knowing
what got him.
(beat)
When your Nai Nai reaches that
point, I’ll tell her too.]
EXT. NAI NAI’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
The family unit makes their way back, past our familiar peach
buildings.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
Close on ELLEN, a chihuahua whose white hair matches that of
the two Nai Nai’s. She whimpers.
LITTLE NAI NAI (O.S.)
[Sing Ellen! Sing! Sing a song for
us!]
NAI NAI
[Sing a song, Ellen, sing!]
Under duress, Ellen begins to "sing" - yelping at the top of
her lungs. Everyone laughs.
As the dog stops singing and the laughter dies down, they
suddenly remember. We linger on each individual face - the
smiles drop, replaced by silence filled with uncertainty and
fear.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
Jian, Little Nai Nai and Auntie Ling cook tirelessly,
dripping with sweat.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Uncle Haibin pours the remainder of a beer into Haiyan’s
glass. They drink compulsively, surrounded by empty bottles.
Hao Hao and Aiko play a game on Aiko’s iPhone.
Billi is at the piano. She hits a few keys. It’s out of tune,
clashing with the cacophony of voices behind her.
Nai Nai notices her sons’ empty beers.
NAI NAI
[Mr. Li, go get the Mao Tai we
saved!]

59.
Jian rushes out of the kitchen in a panic.
JIAN
[Ma, the wedding’s in two days and
there will be a lot to drink. Maybe
it’s best to save that bottle...]
NAI NAI
[What am I saving it for?]
MR. LI
[Where’s the Mao Tai again?]
NAI NAI
[In the bookshelf!]
Mr. Li goes to find the bottle. The sound of Billi’s piano
continues to escalate, forcing Jian and Nai Nai to raise
their voices.
JIAN
[You know these two sons of yours.
Once they start, they can’t stop.
The doctor says Haiyan’s already
got a fatty liver!]
Mr. Li brings out the bottle and pours for Haiyan and Uncle
Haibin.
NAI NAI
[It’s rare for them both to come
home. If they want to drink, let
them drink! We’re celebrating!]
Suddenly, Billi breaks into a full impassioned piano piece
(perhaps Liszt or Prokofiev). Everyone stops what they’re
doing to watch, a little surprised.
Billi’s fingers fly furiously. Expressing through music what
she can’t express in life, Billi’s eyes flicker with rage.
As Billi finishes, everyone is stunned silent. To mask the
awkwardness, Little Nai Nai claps enthusiastically.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Good! Oh my god, too good!]
HAIYAN
[Play another one.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[But play something happier...]
Billi sits at the keys, raw with emotion.

60.
INT. HOTEL BEST, HALLWAY - NIGHT
The men stagger back to their rooms with the help of their
wives.
JIAN
[I told you not to drink, you had
to drink! Your mother’s always
telling me to take care of you, but
if she’s giving you booze she
doesn’t worry about your health?
Every time you drink you get
drunk!]
BILLI
Mom, leave him alone.
HAIYAN
[Who drank too much? I’m not drunk!
My mom gave it to me. I drink with
my Ma... I drink for my Ma...]
INT. HOTEL BEST, JIAN & HAIYAN’S ROOM - NIGHT
Billi watches as Jian removes Haiyan’s jacket in bed.
JIAN
Grab me the water. Over there.
Billi grabs the bottle. Jian brings the bottle to Haiyan’s
mouth, forcing him to drink.
JIAN (CONT’D)
Come. Help me remove his shoes.
Billi and Jian undress Haiyan as he groans.
BILLI
Nai Nai shouldn’t be organizing
this wedding.
JIAN
She enjoy it, so just let her do
it!
BILLI
She’s sick. She should be resting
or in the hospital, not stressing
about a fake wedding!
JIAN
You don’t know your grandma as well
as you think you do.
(MORE)

61.
JIAN (CONT'D)
Don’t you know, she loves to boss
everyone around! Make her feel
important and in control.
Mom...

BILLI

JIAN
It’s true! That’s why she hated
staying at our house in America.
Because she couldn’t tell anyone
what to do. She see me and nothing
I do is good enough for her but in
America she couldn’t say anything
there because it was MY house.
Jian becomes increasingly aggressive with undressing Haiyan,
stripping him down to his underwear.
BILLI
Stop it, Mom.
JIAN
(suddenly defensive)
What? [What did I do?]
BILLI
I know you’ve always had issues
with her, but you need to drop it!
JIAN
I don’t have issues with her. She
has issues with me!
BILLI
She’s dying! Can’t you be a little
more sensitive?
Haiyan groans as their voices raise to a shout.
JIAN
What do you want from me? To scream
and cry like you? You know, when my
father died, I also sad... But I
not act like you! When I went back
to China for the funeral, everyone
was watching me, all expecting me
to fall apart! They think if I
don’t cry, I don’t love my father.
BILLI
No one’s asking you to cry.

62.
JIAN
Death is very personal. I don’t
have to cry in front of everyone to
prove anything! I don’t like to put
you know... all my emotions on
display, like I’m in a zoo! Here
they think that’s the only way to
grieve. By performing for
everybody. Otherwise they think
you’re not respectful. You know, in
China... they even hire
professional crier just WAAAAAH
screaming crying to show oh how sad
they are. It’s ridiculous! I hate
that!
Billi can’t look at her mother. She is at a complete loss.
Prelap the sound of WAILING.
EXT. NATIONAL PEACE CEMETERY - DAY
A funeral procession is led by a melodramatic CRIER. Nothing
specifically indicates whether she’s professional or amateur.
Nearby, the Wang family (including Gu Gu and Bao) gather
around YE YE’S GRAVE. The tomb bears a PHOTO OF YE YE.
They quickly set out fruit, eggs, bao zi (dumplings), bamboowrapped sticky rice, and other offerings. Everyone talks over
each other in a lively manner.
Despite being in a graveyard, the setting is full of life.
Nai Nai hands Hao Hao a bag of food.
NAI NAI
[Here, put these out.]
She hands Billi some bananas.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Give Ye Ye some bananas. He loved
to eat bananas.]
Haiyan opens a bottle of Chinese baijiu. He pours it over Ye
Ye’s grave, then takes a drink himself.
HAIYAN
[Dad, I’m toasting to you.]
Aiko and Hao Hao converse in Japanese over some tangerines.
NAI NAI
[Hurry up and set those out!]

63.
They put them on the grave.
GU GU
[You have to peel them!]
Hao Hao picks the tangerines back up.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Do they need to be peeled? I don't
think they need to be peeled.]
NAI NAI
[Yes, yes. Peel them! Otherwise Ye
Ye can't eat them!]
Haiyan hands Billi the bottle of baijiu. She takes a swig.
HAIYAN
Hey, what are you doing? Pour it
there!
As she finishes pouring, Nai Nai hands her a bag of cookies.
BILLI
Should I open these too?
HAIYAN
[No. Just set those out.]
GU GU
[No! You have to open everything!]
Billi tears open the plastic wrap on the cookies. Gu Gu hands
everyone bunches of flowers, and rips off some petals.
GU GU (CONT’D)
[You have to rip the petals off
too.]
She demonstrates by aggressively tearing up the flowers.
HAIYAN
[Why do we have to rip the
flowers?]
GU GU
[Because of the thieves! There are
people who steal offerings off your
grave and put it on their own
family’s! This way, they won’t
steal it!]
Billi is perplexed by all this, but obeys nonetheless. Haiyan
lights a cigarette and sets it upright on the grave.

64.
NAI NAI
[Hey, don’t give him cigarettes! He
already quit!]
HAIYAN
(teasing)
[Ma, he never quit.]
NAI NAI
[He did! A few weeks before he
passed, he quit.]
HAIYAN
[He just told you he quit, but he
never quit...]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Ma... let the man smoke. He’s
already dead, what else can
happen?]
This makes Nai Nai laugh, and her laughter is contagious.
Nai Nai takes a bite of banana, then feeds some to Billi.
Jian eats an egg, Haiyan smokes a cigarette. It’s a feast.
EXT. NATIONAL PEACE CEMETERY - LATER
Smoke and ash rise from a blazing fire near the grave. Billi
pokes at the fire with a stick, burning fake money, a paper
iPhone.
Nai Nai tosses a paper “coat” into the fire.
NAI NAI
[Burn the coat so Ye Ye can stay
warm in the winter.]
EXT. NATIONAL PEACE CEMETERY - LATER
The entire family is lined up in front of the grave. Ash
settles gently on their hair and their clothes.
Nai Nai leads them in paying their respects.
NAI NAI
(to the grave)
[Old timer, we all came to see you.
Your grandson’s getting married
tomorrow. We came to get your
blessing.]
The sun beats down. Heat rises from the cement. Billi squints
through the lingering smoke.

65.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[We ask you to bless Hao Hao and
his new bride. Bless them with
happiness and bless their child
with health and strength. One bow,
two bows, three bows.]
As Nai Nai bows, the rest of the family follow.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Old timer, you left us too soon.
Why did you have to leave so early?
We hope you are at peace, wherever
you are. We wish you well... One
bow, two bows, three bows.]
They bow again. Hao Hao wipes away some tears.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Bless both our sons, Haiyan and
Haibin with success in their
businesses. One bow, two bows,
three bows.]
More bows. Sweat pours down their faces, but Nai Nai is only
getting started.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Who else? Bless Billi, and her
future. That all the elements of
her life will come together soon.
One bow, two bows, three bows.]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Still bowing! We’re all dizzy!]
NAI NAI
(ignores her)
[And bless my sister. Bless her
to...]
LITTLE NAI NAI
(interrupts, jokes)
[Bless me to win lots of money when
I play Majong!]
Nai Nai doesn’t crack a smile as she continues.
NAI NAI
[Bless your niece, YuPing and also
Bao to do well on his exams. One
bow, two bows, three bows.]

66.
As the embers die down, a GRAVE CLEANER approaches to sweep
away the ashes.
EXT. NATIONAL PEACE CEMETERY - DAY
The group meanders out of the cemetery, snaking through the
sea of gravestones.
NAI NAI
[When the time comes, let’s just
send my ashes into the ocean. No
one’s ever home anyway.]
GU GU
[What are you talking about? I’m
here!]
NAI NAI
[Still, let’s just send it in the
ocean. That way no one has to
travel back and forth all the
time.]
GU GU
[Send it into the ocean, what
nonsense!]
NAI NAI
[You don’t agree?]
GU GU
[I don’t agree! We’re Chinese...
Humans need to return to the earth
they came from!]
Nai Nai lets out a dejected sigh as they continue their march
back into life.
INT. TAXI - DAY
They drive past a significant landmark.
BILLI
Hey I remember that...
HAIYAN
[This is Nai Nai’s old
neighborhood.]
Billi leans toward the window to see.
HAIYAN (CONT’D)
You remember that house? The one
with the garden?

67.
BILLI
Where? Where is it?
JIAN
[We already passed it.]
BILLI
[Can we go back? I want to see it!]
NAI NAI
[There’s nothing to see. Our old
neighborhood is long gone. Even I
don’t recognize it anymore.]
Billi stares out the window, eyes longing.
INT. HOTEL BEST, LOBBY - NIGHT
They enter through the hotel’s revolving door, one after
another.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
Nai Nai soaks her feet in a bucket of hot water, as Mr. Li
attends to her.
MR. LI
[Is it hot enough?]
NAI NAI
[It’s still a little cold.]
Mr. Li carefully pours hot water from a kettle into the
bucket.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[OK OK, that’s enough.]
Nai Nai watches as Mr. Li shuffles away holding the kettle.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Careful, don’t burn yourself.]
He doesn’t acknowledge her. Perhaps he didn’t even hear.
Alone in her room, Nai Nai drops a certain performance of her
own. She is weary. She coughs. Perhaps she knows the truth.
Or perhaps, at 80, she just knows her time is limited.
INT. HOTEL BEST, CANTEEN - NIGHT
Haiyan and Haibin smoke near an open window. They are
engulfed by shadows, as if in hiding.

68.
HAIYAN
[I think that’s something we’ll
need to discuss with her.]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[What’s to discuss? Of course ma
has to be buried beside ba. Her
relationship with Mr. Li is just
one of convenience!]
HAIYAN
[But she’s still with him so I
think it should be her decision.]
Dad?

BILLI (O.S.)

Haiyan takes one last inhale before stamping out the
cigarette.
BILLI (CONT’D)
Are you smoking?
No.

HAIYAN

BILLI
You said you quit!
I did.

HAIYAN

A plume of smoke exits his nostrils.
I will.

HAIYAN (CONT’D)

Uncle Haibin offers Haiyan another cigarette. Billi grabs the
box.
BILLI
[Stop giving him cigarettes!]
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Don’t control him! He’s your
father, you shouldn’t control him.]
HAIYAN
Go to bed, Billi.
Billi looks at the two men, sensing something’s up.
BILLI
What are you talking about?

69.

Nothing.

HAIYAN

BILLI
[Are you going to tell her?]
Uncle Haibin examines Haiyan carefully. Haiyan doesn’t meet
his gaze. He sighs in a way that tells us he’s conflicted.
HAIYAN
[I can’t, Billi. I won’t go against
my family.]
Dad...

BILLI

UNCLE HAIBIN
[You know Billi. You need to
understand something. You guys
moved to a Western country a long
time ago, so you’re no longer
connected to the Eastern way of
looking at things. In America, you
think one’s life belongs to
oneself. But that’s the difference
between the East and the West. In
the East, your life is part of a
whole. Family. Society.]
He lectures to her like she’s a child. Still, his words
register.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[You want to tell Nai Nai the truth
because you feel too much
responsibility carrying it. If you
tell her, then you don’t have to
feel guilty anymore. We’re not
telling her because it is our
responsibility to carry this
emotional burden for her.]
INT. HOTEL BEST, HAO HAO AND AIKO’S ROOM - NIGHT
Hao Hao, Auntie Ling and Jian crawl around the floor as Billi
walks past the open door. She stops to watch them.
JIAN
[Billi, don’t just stand there.
Come help us find Aiko’s earring.]
Billi joins the others and gets on all fours.

70.
BILLI
[Where did you drop it?]
HAO HAO
[Somewhere close.]
Auntie Ling speaks to Aiko in Japanese. This is not
subtitled.
AUNTIE LING
Be careful, don’t move! Maybe it’s
caught on your clothes somewhere.
BILLI
Mom. I want to stay. To help take
care of Nai Nai.
Jian looks at Billi like she’s crazy.
JIAN
You stay? For what? You can’t cook,
you can’t clean. You barely speak
Chinese!
BILLI
I’ll figure it out.
Jian realizes her daughter is being serious.
JIAN
So... you just stay and what...
wait for her to die? What about the
fellowship? You’re 30 years old and
you just stop your life. Stay here.
And every day she has to look at
you... with that sad look on your
face. That’s not nice for anyone,
right?
BILLI
So what can I do? Tell me what I
should do! Because she’s all that’s
left. One of the few good memories
I have of my childhood were those
summers in Nai Nai’s house where
they had that garden and Ye Ye and
I used to catch dragonflies. We
moved to the States and everything
was different, everyone was gone
and suddenly it was just the three
of us.
This finally gets to Jian and she softens.

71.
JIAN
I know it was hard. It was hard for
us too...
BILLI
But you chose to leave. You were
adults and you understood why. I
was just a kid. Nobody ever asked
me what I wanted or how I felt. I
just had to trust you and you told
me it was a good thing to leave,
but it didn’t feel like a good
thing when you and Dad fought all
the time because we didn’t have
money and I was the weird Chinese
girl in school who didn’t speak
English and had no friends or
anyone to talk to. I wanted to
believe that it was a good thing,
but all I saw was the fear in your
eyes. I was confused and scared
constantly because you guys never
told me what was going on.
Hao Hao, Aiko and Auntie Ling observe awkwardly as Billi
finally lets it all go, tears streaming down her face.
Hao Hao hands Billi a tissue.
BILLI (CONT’D)
And then Ye Ye died and you guys
didn’t tell me he was sick so it
felt like, he just vanished
suddenly. And you didn’t even let
me go to his funeral!
JIAN
You were in school. We didn’t want
you to miss school. We did what we
thought was best for you.
BILLI
But I never saw him again! When I
came back to China, he just wasn’t
here anymore, and every time I come
back, he’s just... gone. The house
is gone, Adia’s gone, our Beijing
home is gone, and soon she’ll be
gone too.
This is it. This is everything she’s been feeling. Billi lets
out a deep sigh of relief from the catharsis.

72.
INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
YE YE (60) smokes a cigarette by the window. It’s the middle
of the night and Billi opens her eyes, as if stirred by his
presence.
Her POV of the window: Ye Ye isn’t there, but his smoke
lingers like a ghost.
EXT. CELEBRITY HOTEL - DAY
A row of identically-clad waiters shout a long-winded Chinese
welcome in unison, with wide smiles.
INT. CELEBRITY HOTEL, LOBBY - LATER
A lion dancer leads the bridal party in. Nai Nai is at the
head of the family, greeting guests.
Billi watches as Nai Nai works the room. Nai Nai gives Billi
a stern glare to remind her of her duty. Putting on her best
smile, Billi calls out to relatives with forced enthusiasm.
BILLI
[Hello uncle! Hello auntie!]
Nearby, Nai Nai catches up to Little Nai Nai.
NAI NAI
[Have you picked up the test
results from the hospital? Weren’t
they supposed to be ready
yesterday?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Not yet, I’ll go tomorrow.]
NAI NAI
[Tomorrow’s Saturday! Now we won’t
be able to get it until Monday!]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[So I’ll get it Monday! Stop
worrying! You’re fine!]
INT. CELEBRITY HOTEL, BANQUET HALL - DAY
Plates of CRABS exit the kitchen. Waiters set the crabs on
tables. Kids run amuck as Nai Nai goes from table to table
greeting guests. Hao Hao and Ami also greet guests.
On stage, SUN AO (early 40’s) and his wife NICO give a toast.
Both are tipsy and exuberant.

73.
SUN AO
[We are very happy to have you all
back in Changchun! Doesn’t matter
if you are in America or Japan or
anywhere else... We are all one and
the same! Citizens of the planet
earth, of the Milky Way galaxy, of
the universe! The only thing you
should all know is that no matter
how far you go, even if it’s to the
moon! You will always have a home
here in Changchun. We will always,
always welcome you.]
NICO
[Please, let’s all have a toast so
you know when you come home to
Changchun, you know that you’ll
always eat well, drink well and be
merry! That way, you’ll come back
often!]
As her family eats, Billi stares at the mountain of food in
front of her with no appetite.
Mic feedback alerts the room that someone has taken the
stage, though they’re reluctant to stop eating.
INT. BANQUET HALL, STAGE - CONTINUOUS
Uncle Haibin clears his throat.
UNCLE HAIBIN
[Keep eating, keep eating, I don't
mean to interrupt your meal. As the
eldest son, let me say a few words
on behalf of myself and my
brother.]
Their attention is dispersed as Uncle Haibin launches into
his speech.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[It's been over 25 years since my
brother and I have both been in
China at the same time with our
families. I'm very happy to welcome
Aiko to our family. Perhaps next
time, when we return again, we'll
bring a new baby.]
Uncle Haibin’s voice drifts as he struggles to stay focused.

74.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[My little brother and I haven't
been around, and all these years,
we've had to rely on all of you to
take care of our ma. Chen Ping...
you’ve been here all these years,
by our mother’s side, treating her
like your own. I’m very grateful to
you. To all of you... I want to
thank you, from the bottom of my
heart.
(long beat)
But the person I want to thank the
most...]
His face quivers. Billi leans in, holding her breath.
The entire room suddenly gets quiet. The awkward silence is
underscored by the sporadic SOUND OF CHAIRS AND UTENSILS.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[The person I want to thank the
most... is...
(his voice breaks)
My mother. Forgive us for not being
around, Ma. Everything I am,
everything I've become...]
The dam ruptures with force. Tears stream down his face.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[... is because of my Ma!]
Uncle Haibin's shoulders shake as he sobs uncontrollably on
stage. Uncle Haibin had warned her about this very thing, and
now he's the one falling apart.
Billi watches in disbelief.
UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT’D)
[Ma, you are the best mother in the
entire world.
(he bows)
Thank you, Ma.]
As he finishes, scattered applause fills the room.
Billi turns to Nai Nai, who dabs the moisture from her eyes
with a handkerchief. It’s hard to tell what she’s thinking.
Billi scans the rest of the room. HUNGRY GUESTS, including
Mr. Li and Bao, shove food into their mouths. She leans over
to Haiyan.

75.
BILLI
Does everyone know?
HAIYAN
I think most people don’t know. But
I’m not sure.
A giant shrimp suddenly appears in front of Billi’s face on
Nai Nai’s chopsticks.
NAI NAI
[Eat more, eat more!]
INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER
Aiko wobbles slightly on stage as she delivers a toast. She
speaks in JAPANESE, smiling broadly as Auntie Ling
translates.
AIKO
I’m very happy to be here to
celebrate with you all. Hao Hao is
very nice, good man. I promise to
always treat him well. And, we
hope... maybe next time, we will
bring back a baby.
Hao Hao blushes. Everyone laughs.
INT. BANQUET HALL, BACK AREA - CONTINUOUS
The unaffected LION DANCER smokes a cigarette.
A BORED WAITER sits nearby on her iPhone.
INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER
Nai Nai escorts Hao Hao and Aiko from table to table,
toasting guests.
INT. BANQUET HALL, GENERALS TABLE - LATER
GENERAL ZHU, GENERAL FU and GENERAL MU sit around Nai Nai,
reminiscing about the good ol’ times. Haiyan and Uncle Haibin
are also at the table. Everyone chain smokes around her.
As Billi approaches, Nai Nai motions to her.
NAI NAI
[This is my granddaughter.]
GENERAL MU
[Oh she’s quite pretty!]

76.
GENERAL ZHU
[Married yet?]
Billi's smile tenses up as she stares at the shroud of smoke
around Nai Nai.
Nai Nai herself seems unbothered.
NAI NAI
(to Billi)
[I used to work with these grandpas
in the army. They’re all very
important officials in the
government now!]
GENERAL FU
(laughing)
[We're long retired now!]
GENERAL ZHU
(to Nai Nai)
[Hey Little Ting, I see you’re
limping. Is that still from the
bullet you took in the war?]
NAI NAI
[You still remember that?]
GENERAL ZHU
[How could I forget it? Tell you
the truth, I had it all figured
out. After the war, I was going to
ask you to marry me. But then you
got injured, and Little Wang
carried you off and that was the
end of that. Sly motherfucker.]
Nai Nai blushes and Billi clocks this.
GENERAL FU
[That was a lifetime ago! Now,
you’re confessing your love?]
GENERAL ZHU
[Well if I don’t say anything now,
I’ll take it to my grave. Isn’t
that right, Little Ting?]
NAI NAI
[Little Ting? I’m old Ting now!]
General Mu turns to Billi.

77.
GENERAL MU
[It’s rare for you to come back,
child. Take the opportunity to talk
to your grandmother.]
Billi nods. Nai Nai gestures to the stage.
NAI NAI
[Go on. Go say a few words.]
Billi looks at Nai Nai, remembering her earlier words.
Gracious. Generous in spirit. She takes a deep breath.
INT. BANQUET HALL, STAGE - CONTINUOUS
Billi hesitantly makes her way up to the stage. She takes the
mic, but nobody’s paying attention. She meets Nai Nai's
encouraging gaze and starts.
BILLI
[Hello everyone. As you all know, I
left China when I was very little.]
She pauses, searching for words she hasn’t said in a long
time, if ever.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[My Chinese isn't so good. I’m
sorry...]
A guest shouts “It’s great! Express yourself!” from off stage
followed by a few chuckles.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[OK... um... I almost didn’t come
back this time. I uh...was very
busy with my work. But I still came
back.]
Billi looks at her parents, Uncle Haibin. All eyes are on
her.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[In America, we don’t have many
family. I miss all of you. I’m very
happy to be here. I’m very happy to
celebrate with you all.]
She looks out at Nai Nai, beaming with pride.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[And I just hope... that you’re
happy too.]

78.
Scattered applause as Billi leaves the stage. Thank god
that’s over. But then she remembers something and quickly
runs back up BILLI (CONT’D)
[Oh, and uh...]
(yells offstage to
Haiyan)
Dad, how do you say
congratulations?
Gong xi!

HAIYAN

BILLI
Gong xi Hao Hao and Aiko!
The room bursts into applause.
INT. BANQUET HALL, STAGE - LATER
Billi and Dad sing a karaoke duet of the Fugee’s version of
“Killing Me Softly”.
INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER
ON STAGE. Aiko and Hao Hao sing a Japanese karaoke song.
They’re both incredibly off key.
MAIN TABLE. Jian and Little Nai Nai watch the awkward
performance in silence. Jian senses the weight of Little Nai
Nai’s grief amidst all this celebration.
JIAN
[Auntie, you've spent so long
taking care of your sister. You
also have to take care of yourself
and consider what’s next for you.]
LITTLE NAI NAI
(nods)
[You don't need to worry about me.
I'm very rational about all this.
After she’s gone, I can go be with
my husband in ShenZhen. All these
years, working out there alone has
been hard for him too, but he’s
almost retired. And then he and I
will be able to take ourselves on a
world tour!]
Jian’s not fooled by her feigned cheerfulness, but plays
along.

79.
JIAN
[You can come visit us in
America...]
Little Nai Nai’s performative smile grows wider.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Definitely! I've always wanted to
see your house!]
JIAN
[We'll take you around the country.
Wherever you want to go.]
Little Nai Nai nods a little too eagerly.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[I can even go visit Haibin and his
family in Japan. See, I've thought
things through very clearly. You
don't have to worry about me.]
As Little Nai Nai turns back around to face away from Jian,
her smile drops. The effort of these performative emotions
takes its toll.
INT. BANQUET HALL, STAGE - LATER
A MOTHER DAUGHTER DUO does a choreographed K-pop dance.
INT. BANQUET HALL, TABLE - LATER
The entire family flaps their arms like birds. This is a
drinking game. Joyful and exhilarating, the game allows them
all to forget for the time being.
Hao Hao keeps messing up the game so he drinks. He drinks,
and drinks and drinks.
INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY
ON STAGE. A YOUNG CHINESE WOMAN sings a melancholic Italian
opera.
In the middle of the room, Hao Hao bawls uncontrollably.
Seeing this, Gu Gu runs up to him. A few TEEN GIRLS also
huddle around him.
Gu Gu locks eyes with Billi and waves frantically. Billi
rushes over, searching the room for Nai Nai. Nai Nai is
distracted by a conversation with Mrs. Gao.

80.
TEEN GIRL #1
[What’s wrong Hao Hao? Why are you
sad?]
GU GU
[He’s fine. It’s OK.]
Gu Gu’s eyes well with tears.
TEEN GIRL #2
[Why are you crying Hao Hao? Don’t
cry...]
As she says this, Teen Girl #2 begins to cry. This gets Teen
Girl #1 crying too. It’s contagious - the louder one girl
cries, the louder the other girl cries.
Gu Gu dries her tears, annoyed by the hysterics.
GU GU
[Why are YOU crying?]
TEEN GIRL #2
[I don’t know...]
TEEN GIRL #1
[I don’t know either!]
INT. BANQUET HALL, BACK AREA - DAY
Billi tries to console Hao Hao. They can’t communicate, but
it’s a tender moment.
INT. BANQUET HALL, PORTRAIT BACKDROP - DAY
Nai Nai is surrounded by the entire family, posed for a
portrait. Uncle Haibin sets up the camera on a tripod.
Nai Nai notices Hao Hao’s face - it’s red and puffy from
crying.
NAI NAI
[What's the matter Hao Hao? Did you
drink too much?]
Tears leak down Hao Hao’s face.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[You can’t take a wedding photo
with the groom crying. What are you
crying about?]

81.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[He’s fine. He’s just happy. Those
are tears of joy! Isn't that right,
Hao Hao?]
Hao Hao nods weakly.
UNCLE HAIBIN (O.S.)
[OK, everybody look at the camera!]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Will you take one with my camera
too? Sis, where is it?]
NAI NAI
[I gave it to Mrs. Gao. It’s in her
purse.]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Where is she?]
NAI NAI
[I sent her to the hospital to pick
up my test results.]
Little Nai Nai’s face drops and Billi clocks this. Uncle runs
into the photo UNCLE HAIBIN
[On the count of three, everybody
say ‘eggplant!’]
Everyone says ‘eggplant’ with a forced smile. The camera goes
off with a flash. Billi and Little Nai Nai’s faces are
frozen in a look of shock.
As the rest of the family stays frozen in a smile, Billi
awkwardly excuses herself from the group photo. She begins to
run.
EXT. CHANGCHUN STREETS - DAY
Billi sprints through the city with all her might. She stops
momentarily to catch her breath and her thoughts catch up to
her actions.
There’s no time to think. She takes off running again.
INT. THE PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL, LOBBY - DAY
Billi runs inside, asks someone for directions.

82.
INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, SECOND FLOOR - DAY
Billi bolts up the stairs and frantically searches for Mrs.
Gao. She spots her and runs up to her.
MRS. GAO
[Oh, what are you doing here?]
BILLI
(out of breath)
[Did you get it?]
MRS. GAO
[The test results? Yea.]
[Where?]

BILLI

Mrs. Gao digs into her purse and pulls out a document. She
hands it to Billi, scanning the panic on her face.
MRS. GAO
[What’s the matter? What’s it say?]
Billi looks up at Mrs. Gao, confused.
BILLI
[I don’t know. I can’t read
Chinese. Didn’t you read it?]
MRS. GAO
(blushes)
[I... I can’t read.
(beat)
I never went to school.]
Despite her relief, Billi softens with sympathy.
BILLI
[Come on, let’s go.]
INT. COPY CENTER - DAY
The test result document is scanned into a computer.
Billi, Little Nai Nai and Mrs. Gao huddle over the COPY
CENTER OWNER as he tries to doctor the results in his
computer.
COPY CENTER OWNER
[What should I write?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Just write benign shadows.]

83.
COPY CENTER OWNER
[Benign shadows? What’s that?]
LITTLE NAI NAI
[It means... it’s not fatal.]
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The entire family gathers around Nai Nai as she examines the
document. Time slows. Nai Nai nods, as if she knew all along.
NAI NAI
[See. I told you I was fine!]
EXT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - DUSK
The family walks in epic slow-motion as a single unit.
Little Nai Nai, Aiko and Hao Hao. Uncle and Auntie. Haiyan
and Jian. Billi is framed in the center.
They’re all in this together. There’s no turning back.
EXT. CHANGCHUN - DUSK
It’s dark and the city is still asleep. A light comes on in
one window.
INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DUSK
Nai Nai opens the closet door and grabs a RED ENVELOPE. She
hands it to Billi.
BILLI
[Don’t give me money, Nai Nai...]
NAI NAI
[Take it, child! Take it! I gave
one to Hao Hao so I want to give
you one too.]
BILLI
[But... I didn’t get married.]
NAI NAI
[Even more reason! You’re all on
your own, with no one to support
you. And I can’t be of much help to
you. I’m sorry. I wish there was
more I could do to help you.]
Nai Nai’s eyes well with tears as she grapples with her
helplessness. She pushes the envelope into Billi’s hand.

84.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[Take it, my child.]
Billi nods, emotional.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[And don’t spend it on anything
practical like rent! Buy yourself
something nice...]
Billi smiles.
BILLI
[I don’t want to leave, Nai Nai.]
NAI NAI
[You’ll be back.]
Billi fights back tears.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
[I know you’re always thinking of
me. But you don’t need to worry.
I’m fine. I’ve been taking the new
medicine and I feel much better.]
[Really?]

BILLI

NAI NAI
[You have work to do. You have so
much ahead of you. I’m proud of
you.]
Billi diverts her eyes, something clearly on her mind. After
a beat, she decides to be honest.
BILLI
[I didn’t get the grant.]
NAI NAI
[Really? You just heard?]
BILLI
[Last week. I didn’t tell you
because...
(beat)
I didn’t want you to worry.]
Nai Nai considers this and nods.

85.
NAI NAI
[I’m not worried. You’ll be fine.
Child, I’ve walked the path of life
and I have a piece of advice for
you. Whatever you encounter in
life, you must fight to stay
positive. Your journey ahead is
still long and you will have
difficulties, but when you
encounter something catastrophic,
you have to think it through with
an open mind and find the light.
Don’t be a bull ramming its horns
into the dark corner of a room.
You’ll get stuck. Your mind is
incredibly powerful. Where your
thoughts go, your body follows. You
must keep your perspective... and
keep going forward.]
Billi nods as she absorbs Nai Nai’s advice.
NAI NAI (CONT’D)
(beat)
[You’ve always been fearless. So I
know you’re gonna be fine.]
Billi puts her head on Nai Nai’s shoulder.
BILLI
[Are you really OK, Nai Nai?]
NAI NAI
[Yes! Why would I lie to you?]
There’s a knock on the door as Little Nai Nai opens the door.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Taxi’s here. Come on.]
Billi and Nai Nai savor this moment, side by side. Mrs. Gao
passes them in the doorway, sweeping.
INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - MORNING
Chaos and commotion as Billi, Jian and Haiyan attempt to say
goodbye. It’s impossible, so instead of goodbye, they shout
at each other, everyone overlapping.
JIAN
[Ma, don’t come down!]
NAI NAI
[I’ll come down with you, come on.]

86.
LITTLE NAI NAI
[Sis, you don’t need to go! It’s
cold outside!]
HAIYAN
[Ma, don’t catch a cold!]
NAI NAI
[I’m coming, I’m coming! Hurry up
let’s go!]
Nai Nai struggles down the dingy stairwell despite everyone’s
urging.
EXT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Billi and Nai Nai hug goodbye. Both struggle to maintain
composure.
BILLI
[Don't cry, Nai Nai.]
NAI NAI
[I'm not crying. You don't cry.]
BILLI
[I'm not crying.]
Billi smiles as convincingly as possible.
BILLI (CONT’D)
[I'll be back to see you.]
NAI NAI
[Yes, I know. You’ll be back. I’ll
see you very soon. Go on, let's not
drag this out anymore. It hurts my
heart.]
JIAN
[Ma, take care of yourself.]
NAI NAI
[Stop it. Don't make a scene. Just
go. Hurry up or you'll miss your
flight!]
They’re all back to shouting.
JIAN
[Go upstairs, Ma! It's chilly!
Hurry and go!]

87.
HAIYAN
[Ma, go upstairs!]
NAI NAI
[I will after you get in the car.
Go on or you’ll miss your flight!]
They get in the car, but Nai Nai doesn’t leave. She limps
after the car as it pulls away.
INT. TAXI - MORNING
POV from the back windshield. Nai Nai stands at the end of
the alley, watching as the car drives away. She waves as her
squat figure gets smaller.
Little Nai Nai tries to get her sister to leave, but she
doesn’t budge. She remains in the same spot - watching,
waving, her heart in her throat. The car turns the corner and
just like that, Nai Nai’s gone.
Billi turns around, numb with grief. To her surprise, she
sees Jian weeping silently. There are no words.
INT. TAXI - LATER
Haiyan is asleep in the front seat. After what seems like
endless silence, Billi finally turns to her mother.
BILLI
Mom... if one of you guys got
sick... in America... what should I
do? Would you want me to lie to
you?
JIAN
Definitely not! Are you crazy?
Billi and Mom both chuckle through their tears. At least
they’re on the same page about something.
JIAN (CONT’D)
Do you regret that we brought you
to America?
BILLI
Of course not.
Another long pause as Billi considers Mom’s question.
BILLI (CONT’D)
Do you? Leaving I mean.

88.
JIAN
I don’t regret, but... it’s
complicated.
Outside the car, the sun is rising and the city begins to
wake.
JIAN (CONT’D)
You know... when I was still living
in China, when you were very young,
I visited a blind psychic. He told
me I’d have three children. He said
there’s a lot of water in my life.
Water means talent, so a lot of
talent. But my water is long and
flowing - a river, so I cannot keep
any of it.
POV of long empty highways to the airport.
JIAN (CONT’D)
But my daughter, he said. She is
also water but she is big ocean
water. So my river will flow into
her.
BILLI
What if I can’t be your ocean?
JIAN
It’s not whether or not you can be.
The psychic said you already are.
If you believe it, then it’s true.
BILLI
Well he was wrong. You didn't have
three children.
JIAN
No, he was right. I was meant to
have three. But it was China. We
couldn't. You were first. So you
were it.
Billi’s heart swells with compassion.
INT. TAXI - LATER
Mom and Dad are fast asleep. They’re weary and vulnerable.
They’re human.

89.
INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Billi walks into the dark apartment with her suitcase.
Despite being a small studio apartment, her place now feels
enormous.
Empty. Silent. Nothing but her own shadows.
EXT. STREET, NYC - NIGHT
Billi strolls down the sidewalk, the weight of the world on
her shoulders. Overwhelmed by emotion, she appears to be on
the verge of breaking down.
She stops in the middle of the street. Strangers walk around
her, absorbed in their own lives.
As Billi stands there amidst the chaos of the city, a
different energy suddenly overtakes her. Instead of
crumbling, she lifts her chin and inhales deeply.
Then, with all the life force in her, with the spirit of Nai
Nai, she shouts HA!

BILLI

EXT. NAI NAI’S NEIGHBORHOOD, CHANGCHUN CHINA - DAY
Our familiar peach-colored buildings surround a LARGE TREE.
Billi’s voice echoes loudly into this shot - echoing across
the globe.
BIRDS scatter from the tree, flying off into the distance as
a unit, the pattern of their formation silhouetted against
the sky.
