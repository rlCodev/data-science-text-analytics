LYNDON JOHNSON
I have today ordered to Vietnam the
Air Mobile Division and certain
other forces which will raise our
fighting strength from 75,000 to
125,000 almost immediately. This
will make it necessary to increase
our active fighting forces by
raising the monthly draft from
17,000 to 35,000 per month.
MUSIC crashes in that will take us through the prologue--a
nation coming off the rails.

A few well-scrubbed young men from the Youth Draft Advisory

EXT. RURAL MAILBOX TREE - DAY

A line of mailboxes sit on the side of a rural road. One of
them is open. We move down and see mail scattered at the feet
of a young black man, 18, slumped down on the ground, his
induction notice shaking in his hands.
MARTIN LUTHER KING (V.O.)
It should be incandescently clear
that no one who has any concern for
the integrity of life in America
today can ignore the present war-5

It’s pouring rain and Robert Kennedy is talking to a crowd of

So I ask you to return home and say
a prayer for the family of Martin
Luther King.
We HEAR the GUN SHOT that killed Kennedy-8

INT. CAMPUS AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

RENNIE
We were there.
RENNIE DAVIS, mid-20’s, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt
and tie, is speaking to a standing room only crowd of
students. In contrast to the cliche of the times, most of the
students are fairly conservatively dressed. On the movie
screen is footage of a Vietnamese village-RENNIE (CONT'D)
We didn’t see Vietnamese soldiers.
What we saw were population
centers. Schoolhouses, pagodas,
women and children.
Suddenly the movie screen fills with huge explosions of
yellow, black and searing white.
RENNIE (CONT'D)
And that’s American napalm. The
women and children were burned
alive. Tom?
TOM HAYDEN steps out from the darkness. He’s 30, handsome and
serious.
TOM
The Democratic Party is going to
nominate Hubert Humphrey next month
in Chicago.

We ID the two men with a chyron-Tom Hayden

Rennie Davis

Leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)

4.
TOM (CONT'D)
When it comes to the war, when it
comes to social justice, there’s
simply not enough of a difference
between Hubert Humphrey and Richard
Nixon to make a difference.
APPLAUSE-TOM (CONT'D)
And so we’re going to Chicago.
The APPLAUSE BUILDS-TOM (CONT'D)
Young people by busloads will go to
Chicago to show our solidarity and
our disgust and most importantly-11

ABBIE
--to get laid by someone you just
met.
The place is seedy and packed with people and smoke.
JERRY
536,000 of us sent to a country not
one of these bumper sticker
patriots in Washington could find

We ID the two men with a chyron-Abbie Hoffman

Jerry Rubin

Leaders of the Youth International Party (Yippies)
ABBIE
We’re goin’ to Chicago. Anyone who
stays in the park, sings Woody
Guthrie, they’re gonna be fine. But
the cops are gonna be a half-inch
from losin’ their fuckin’ minds
‘cause Daley’s gonna wind ‘em up to
make sure of it. We’re goin’ to
Chicago peacefully. We’re going
peacefully, but if we’re met there
with violence, you better believe
we’re gonna meet that violence with-

EXT. SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY

DAVE
Non-violence. Always non-violence
and that’s without exception.
DAVE, 55, who looks like (and is) a Boy Scout Troop leader,
is talking to his wife and young son as he loads a suitcase
and some material for making placards into an old station
wagon.
We ID the man with a chyron-David Dellinger
Leader of the Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam (The
Mobe)
SON
What if the police start hitting
you?
DAVE
Why would the police start hitting
me?
SON
What if they do?
I’ll duck.

DAVE

MRS. DELLINGER
David. He watches the news.
Why?

DAVE

MRS. DELLINGER
You taught him to!
DAVE
Guys. I’ve organized a hundred
protests. This one isn’t going to
be any different in that it almost
certainly won’t work. The police-MRS. DELLINGER
I’m not worried about the police.
And I’m not worried about Hayden
and Rennie Davis. I’m worried about
Hoffman and Rubin.

6.
DAVE
It’s the Democratic National
Convention, honey, every camera in
America is gonna be pointed at it
and Daley isn’t gonna let his city
become a theater of war. And
Hoffman and Rubin are geniuses...in
their own special way.
Oh Jesus--

MRS. DELLINGER

DAVE
(re the SON)
He’s got a Scout meeting tonight at

Dad--

SON

DAVE
If the police try to arrest me I’ll
do what I always do and what I’ve
taught you to do, which is what?

Which is what? Tell me, bud.
SON
Very calmly and very politely-13

INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

BOBBY
Fuck the motherfuckers up.
BOBBY, 32, is talking to his girlfriend, SONDRA, and getting
ready to leave. We’ll get a tour of Panther headquarters-printing presses, maps, guns, body guards and women, a few of
them white.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
They leave us alone and
everything’s cool. They tangle,
disrupt, intimidate, they play it
fast and loose with the First
Amendment-Robert--

SONDRA

BOBBY
--they start breaking heads, then
no, we will not be on our way.

7.
We ID BOBBY with a chyron-Bobby Seale
National Chairman of the Black Panther Party
SONDRA
You can’t give this speech in
Chicago.
BOBBY
Fred Hampton wants me there.
SONDRA
Let Fred give the speech.
BOBBY
Between Hayden and Hoffman there
could be five-thousand people. It’d
be nice to talk to five-thousand
people.
SONDRA
Not while you’re in trouble in
Connecticut.
BOBBY
Yes while I’m in trouble in--I’m
the head of the Black Panthers,
Sondra, when the hell am I not
gonna be in trouble?!
SONDRA
You’re gonna be in a lot more of it
if you stand up and say “Fry the
pigs”!
BOBBY
“If they attack you”, you’re taking
it out of context.
SONDRA
So will every white person in
America, cops won’t give a shit
about context and you don’t have
enough protection in Chicago!
BOBBY
There’s no place to be right now
but in it.
SONDRA
But fry the pigs?

8.

“IF THEY-Dr. King--

BOBBY
SONDRA

BOBBY
--is dead! He has a dream? Well now
he has a fuckin’ bullet in his
head. Martin’s dead. Malcolm’s
dead. Medgar’s dead. Bobby’s dead.
Jesus is dead. They tried it
peaceful. We’re gonna try something
else.
(pause)
Sondra, I’ll be there for four
hours, that’s it.
SONDRA takes a pistol from a rack-SONDRA
You at least gonna take one of
these?
BOBBY
If I knew how to use that I
wouldn’t need to make speeches.

It’s a grey, rainy morning.
TITLE:
U.S. Department of Justice
Office of the Newly Appointed Attorney General, John Mitchell
36

INT. MITCHELL’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
RICHARD SCHULTZ and THOMAS FORAN are waiting on the couch.
SCHULTZ, 33, is a bright lawyer with a pleasant if serious
manner. FORAN is his boss. From their body language we can
tell they’ve been called to the principal’s office.
We ID the two men with a chyron-Richard Schultz

Thomas Foran

Federal Prosecutors
SECRETARY
You’ve arrived at a moment in
history.

36

13.
SCHULTZ wasn’t sure what she just said or if she was even
talking to him...
SCHULTZ
(pause)
Pardon me?
SECRETARY
(pointing)
They’re changing the picture.
Sure enough, when SCHULTZ looks at what the secretary is
talking about he sees a workman swapping out a large framed
photo on the wall of Lyndon Johnson with one of Richard
Nixon.
SCHULTZ nods.
The office door opens and HOWARD, a high-level Justice
Department deputy steps out.
Tom.
Howard.

HOWARD
FORAN

HOWARD
You flew in alright?
Sure.

FORAN

HOWARD
Richard Schultz?
Yes sir.

SCHULTZ

HOWARD
Howard Ackerman, Special Advisor to
the Attorney General.
SCHULTZ
Pleased to meet you.
HOWARD
Were you told what this is about?
SCHULTZ
No sir. Just to meet Mr. Foran at
O’Hare this morning, that we were
flying to Washington and that we
were meeting Mr. Mitchell.

14.
HOWARD
Good.
(noticing)
They’re finally changing the
goddamn picture. C’mon in.
They follow HOWARD into-37

INT. JOHN MITCHELL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
JOHN MITCHELL is standing behind his desk, lighting a
cigarette.
MITCHELL
As a matter of courtesy and
tradition, when we elect a new
president, the outgoing cabinet
members resign to spare the new
president the unpleasantness of
firing them. You know when
President Nixon received Ramsey
Clark’s formal letter of
resignation?
No, sir.

SCHULTZ

MITCHELL
About an hour before I was
confirmed. That was to embarrass
me. I don’t know, I think it was
more embarrassing for Ramsey Clark.
I’m John Mitchell.
FORAN
Thomas Foran, Mr. Attorney General,
and this is Richard Schultz.
MITCHELL
Richard, Chicago was more fucked up
than any ten things I’ve ever seen
in my life.
Sir?

SCHULTZ

HOWARD
The convention. The riots.
Yes sir.

SCHULTZ

37

15.
MITCHELL
Johnny Walker okay with everybody?
Thank you.
Richard?

FORAN
MITCHELL

SCHULTZ
Nothing for me, thank you.
MITCHELL
We don’t know how Humphrey’s people
could’ve been that stupid--allow
their guy to get nominated under
armed guard.
(to SCHULTZ)
You think that’s what lost him the
election?
Sir?

SCHULTZ

MITCHELL
Son, are you nervous?
No sir.

SCHULTZ

MITCHELL
Why the fuck not?
(beat)
I’m kidding. Don’t believe
everything you’ve heard about me.
Ramsey Clark gives me the finger on
the way out the door. I’m asking if
you think Chicago is why Humphrey
lost the election.
SCHULTZ
No sir, I think the Republicans ran
a better candidate.
MITCHELL
That’s for damn sure.
HOWARD
And Daley didn’t help his party
either but Humphrey’s people and
Daley didn’t break the law so
that’s someone else’s table.

16.
SCHULTZ
Well as a matter of fact, sir, we
don’t believe any federal laws were
broken last summer. Mr. Foran had
our office run a thorough
investigation. Plenty of
trespassing, destruction of public
property, lewd behavior I suppose,
but-MITCHELL starts laughing. So does HOWARD. So SCHULTZ stops
talking for a brief moment before-SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
...nothing rising to the level of-MITCHELL
Do you think you and your boss are
in the Attorney General’s office
because I want you to seek an
indictment for violating a federal
trespassing law?
SCHULTZ
Sir, our office wasn’t aware the
Justice Department wanted to seek
any indictments at all.
We do.

MITCHELL

SCHULTZ
Ramsey Clark was dead set against
bringing federal-MITCHELL
Ramsey Clark doesn’t run the
Justice Department anymore, did you
hear about that? And Mr. Johnson’s
back home in Texas.
SCHULTZ
Of course, sir.
MITCHELL
One hour before my confirmation
hearing gaveled, that’s when he
resigned. What a prick.
SCHULTZ
It was unprofessional, sir.

17.
MITCHELL
Unprofessional, it was unpatriotic.
And I’ll tell you what else--it was
impolite. There’s such a thing as
manners. I want to bring back
manners, how ‘bout that. The
America I grew up in. Will you
help me, Mr. Schultz? ‘Cause I
asked Mr. Foran who was the best
prosecutor in his office and he
said you.
Thank you.

SCHULTZ

HOWARD tosses SCHULTZ a file-HOWARD
Section 2101 of Title 18.
MITCHELL
That’s the federal law that was
broken.
SCHULTZ
That’s the Rap Brown law.
HOWARD
Conspiracy to Cross State Lines in
Order to Incite Violence. It comes
with a ten-year maximum and we want
all ten.
SCHULTZ
For whom, sir?
HOWARD tosses SCHULTZ another file-HOWARD
The all-star team.
SCHULTZ looks at the top page in the file-SCHULTZ
Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom
Hayden, Rennie Davis, Dave
Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John
Froines...and Bobby Seale?
MITCHELL
I call them the schoolboys, and
when I do, everyone here knows who
I’m talking about. Petulant and
dangerous.
(MORE)

18.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
And we’ve watched for a decade
while these rebels without a job
who’ve never bothered to get their
hands dirty fighting the enemy tell
us how to prosecute a war. The
decade’s over, the grown-ups are
back and I deem these shitty little
fairies to be a threat to national
security so they’re gonna spend
their 30’s in a federal facility.
Real time.
FORAN
You’re lead prosecutor, Richard.
You understand why I couldn’t tell
you until we got here.
SCHULTZ
Sure. Yes sir.
There’s an awkward silence...
HOWARD
Richard, you’re being given the
ball, are you ready to do this?
SCHULTZ
You pay me for my opinion.
What?

MITCHELL

SCHULTZ
I said, sir, you pay me for my
opinion?
MITCHELL
Where did you learn that, in class?
I pay you to win.
SCHULTZ
I’m not sure we can get a good
indictment on conspiracy.
Why not?

MITCHELL

SCHULTZ
For one thing, some of these people
had never met each other.
MITCHELL
Telephones.

19.
SCHULTZ
Mr. Attorney General, the Rap Brown
law was created by southern whites
in Congress to limit the free
speech of black activists.
(beat)
Civil Rights activists who were
coming in from the-MITCHELL
I know why it was--why the fuck is
he teaching--It doesn’t matter to
why the law was passed, it matters
what it can do.
SCHULTZ
We’re not sure what it can do
because no one’s ever been charged
with it.
FORAN
That makes it exciting, it’s virgin
land. Undeveloped real estate.
MITCHELL
It’s a law and they broke it.
Of course.

SCHULTZ

MITCHELL
Is there a problem?
No sir.

SCHULTZ

MITCHELL
Say what you want to say since
apparently I’m paying you for your
wisdom. Gimme my money’s worth.
SCHULTZ
There will be people who’ll see
this as the Justice Department
restraining free speech and there
will people who’ll see these men as
martyrs.
MITCHELL
Are any of those people in this
room?

20.
SCHULTZ
(beat)
No sir.
MITCHELL
You’re 33 and you’re about to be
named lead prosecutor in the most
important trial in your lifetime
after having been hand-picked by
the Attorney General, I’m about to
do it right now. But before I do,
let me ask you, how do you see
them?
SCHULTZ
(beat)
Personally or in terms of-MITCHELL
Personally.
SCHULTZ
I see them as vulgar, antiestablishment, anti-social and
unpragmatic, but none of those
things are indictable.
MITCHELL
Then imagine how impressed I’ll be
when you get an indictment.
SCHULTZ
And there’s the bigger question.
Which is?

MITCHELL

SCHULTZ
Who started the riot? Was it the
protestors or was it the police?
MITCHELL
The police don’t start riots.
SCHULTZ
They’ll have witnesses who’ll say
they started this one.
MITCHELL
And you’ll dismantle them. And
you’ll win. Because, Mr. Schultz,
that’s what’s expected of you.

21.
SCHULTZ
(beat)
Yes sir.

INT. MITCHELL’S OUTER-OFFICE - DAY

38

As SCHULTZ and FORAN step out and the door closes behind
them.
FORAN
(quietly)
You didn’t show a lot of gratitude
in there.
SCHULTZ
(quietly)
On top of everything else, we’re
giving them exactly what they want-a stage and an audience.
FORAN
You really think it’s going to be a
big audience?
And we HEAR a CROWD start to chant--faint at first but then
growing in volume-CROWD (V.O.)
The whole world is watching! The
whole world is watching! The whole
world is watching!...
SCHULTZ closes his eyes for a moment and shakes his head
slightly at the cluelessness of Foran’s question.
SCHULTZ
Yes sir, I do.
And SCHULTZ exits first as we
CUT TO:
39

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

39

We see the source of the chanting--a massive crowd being held
back by rope lines and police officers. While most of the
crowd is shouting its support of the defendants, a healthy
number are making it clear they find the defendants’ hair too
long and politics too left and are urging them to go live
someplace else.

22.
We whip-pan to different signs: “Free the Chicago 7”; “Out of
Vietnam Now!”; “What About White Civil Rights?”; “Love It Or
Leave It!”, etc.

INT. COURTHOUSE ROTUNDA - SAME TIME

A couple of POLICE OFFICERS escort ABBIE and JERRY through
the front doors and through the rotunda. Press and
photographers are being held back by a velvet rope as
flashbulbs spray-ABBIE
You alright?
JERRY
I was until I saw this.
ABBIE
Most of them are on our side.
Someone from the crowd shouts out-CROWD MEMBER
(shouting)
We love you, Abbie!
ABBIE turns to flash the guy a peace sign when the guy throws
an egg at him. Incredibly, JERRY grabs the egg out of the air
without breaking it as the POLICE OFFICERS head into the
crowd to find the guy who threw it.
ABBIE
Jesus Christ. How did you do that?
JERRY
Experience.
JERRY stands there a moment...
ABBIE
You don’t know what to do with the

The corridor’s lined with press. The elevator dings and the
doors open as WILLIAM KUNSTLER and LEONARD WEINGLASS step
off. KUNSTLER is a rumpled man in his 40’s and WEINGLASS is
quieter though no less a legal mind.
The reporters immediately start shouting questions.
KUNSTLER
Hang on, quiet down please. I want
you all to meet a new addition to
the defense team, this is Leonard
Weinglass, one of this country’s
most talented First Amendment
litigators.
REPORTER (SY)
Bill, can you tell us-KUNSTLER
(quieting the others)
Go ahead, Sy.
SY
Can you tell us the status of
Charles Garry?
KUNSTLER
Charles Garry is still in the
hospital and you should contact his
office for information. Marjorie.
MARJORIE
Does that mean you’re representing
Bobby Seale today?
KUNSTLER
It’s very important that it be
understood that for his own
protection, I am not acting as
Bobby Seale’s attorney today. One
more. Jack.
JACK
Bill, I was told that it was Hayden
who wanted to bring Mr. Weinglass
in. That Hayden has concerns about
your seriousness.
Well--

KUNSTLER

WEINGLASS
This is William Kunstler. You want
to find out how serious he is, meet
him at a witness stand.

The gallery is packed with diehard supporters of the
defendants as well as a full press section in the back.
There’s more than the usual amount of security and we’ll
notice a half-dozen MARSHALS wearing blue blazers and badges.
DAVID DELLINGER is talking to the WIFE and SON we met
earlier.
SCHULTZ, FORAN and an ASSISTANT are talking at the
prosecutor’s table.
We move down and find JOHN FROINES and LEE WEINER already at
the defense table. FROINES and WEINER are Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern and are never separated.
Weiner.
Yeah.

FROINES
WEINER

FROINES
I get why they’re trying to smoke
Abbie and Jerry and Hayden, even
Rennie and Dellinger, but for the
life of me I can’t figure out what
the two of us are doing here.
WEINER
I feel exactly the same way. But
this is the Academy Awards of
protest and as far as I’m concerned
it’s an honor just to be nominated.
We move down the defense table where TOM is sitting next to
RENNIE. TOM points to a piece of paper in front of RENNIE...
TOM
What is that?

25.
RENNIE
I’ve been keeping a list every day.
Americans who’ve been killed since
the day we were arrested.
Why?

TOM

RENNIE
With the trial starting it might
get easy to forget who this is
about.
TOM nods a little.
KUNSTLER and WEINGLASS takes their seats at the defense table

Fellas.

KUNSTLER

RENNIE
Good morning.
WEINGLASS
Good morning.
TOM
Good morning.
KUNSTLER
(quietly to TOM)
I just got a question about my
seriousness. Whatever’s going on
between you and Abbie, keep it out
of this building.
TOM
I just feel like this is gearing up
to be-A heavy door on the side of the courtroom opens with a bang
and BOBBY SEALE, handcuffed and in prison coveralls, is
brought in by two MARSHALS.
A group of 8 or so African-Americans sitting together in
front, along with FRED HAMPTON--21, handsome and a steady
leader.
KUNSTLER moves so he can talk to both BOBBY and FRED
privately.
Fred.

KUNSTLER

Bill.

FRED

KUNSTLER kneels down next to BOBBY-KUNSTLER
(quietly)
Did you have breakfast this
morning?
BOBBY
(pause)
What?
KUNSTLER
Did you have breakfast?
I did.

BOBBY

KUNSTLER
What’d you have?
FRED
What are you doing?
KUNSTLER
I’m talking to him about breakfast
because that’s the only thing I’m
allowed to talk to him about.
FRED
That’s right.
Bobby--

KUNSTLER

FRED
We have instructions from our
lawyer.
KUNSTLER
If you need me I’m sitting right
there. You just look at me and say,
“I need you”.
FRED
We don’t need you.
BOBBY
You two gonna be like this?

27.
KUNSTLER
(to BOBBY, re: the AfricanAmericans in the gallery)
They shouldn’t sit together. The
jury’s not gonna like that look.
BOBBY
This isn’t my jury. And if they
don’t like the look, they can-FRED
No, he’s right.
(to the group)
Spread out, okay? In pairs.
And Fred?

KUNSTLER

KUNSTLER makes a subtle gesture to his head to indicate that
they should take off their berets.
BOBBY
No, they’re dressed just fine.
FRED
It’s alright.
(to the group)
Take your very scary hats off.
(back to KUNSTLER)
Don’t mess us up.
KUNSTLER
Alright, good pep talk.
KUNSTLER goes back to his seat just as ABBIE and JERRY are
sitting down.
ABBIE
You see the crowd out there?
JERRY
I have an egg.
KUNSTLER
Get rid of that.
JERRY
You don’t think I want to?
ABBIE
It’s like we’re, you know,
whatshisname, we just met him.

28.

Yeah.

JERRY

ABBIE
(beat)
What is his name?
Who?

JERRY

ABBIE
The drummer. The greatest drummer
ever.
JERRY
Gene Krupa?
ABBIE
No, I’m talkin’ about--Gene Krupa?-I’m talkin’ about the drummer for
Cream, we just met him last night.
JERRY
Ginger Baker.
ABBIE
Thank you. The crowd outside is so
big it’s as if we’re Ginger Baker,
is what I was trying to say.
KUNSTLER
Are you stoned?
Yeah. You?

ABBIE

KUNSTLER goes back to his seat and settles in. Then he turns
to TOM-KUNSTLER
(quietly)
You remember what I said.
TOM
Okay, and you remember to keep us
out of prison.
KUNSTLER
A lot of good advice this morning.
The heavy wooden door behind the bench opens-All rise!

BAILIFF

--and JUDGE HOFFMAN takes his place at the bench. It’s not
entirely clear whether HOFFMAN is a bad judge, in the tank
for the prosecution, experiencing early senility or a
combination of all three.

Hoffman presiding. God save the
United States of America and this
Honorable Court.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Marshal, bring in our jury.
The jury is led in as JUDGE HOFFMAN continues...
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
As I look out into the gallery I
see we have a full house. Some of
you started forming a line early
this morning. I’ll caution you that
this isn’t a sporting event. Let
the record show that we’ve been
joined by our twelve jurors and
four alternates. Mrs. Winter,
please call the case.
MRS. WINTER
69 CR 180, United States of America
vs. David Dellinger, Rennard C.
Davis, Thomas Hayden, Abbott
Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin, Lee
Weiner, John R. Froines and Bobby
G. Seale for trial.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Are the People ready to make
opening arguments?
SCHULTZ

We are, Your Honor.
TITLE:
Trial Day 1
BOBBY stands--

30.
BOBBY
I don’t have my lawyer here.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
It’s not your turn to speak.
BOBBY
My trial’s begun without my lawyer.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Please sit. Mr. Schultz?
SCHULTZ takes a moment and begins-SCHULTZ
Good morning, my name is Richard
Schultz and I’m an Assistant U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District
of Illinois. Seated at my table is
my boss, U.S. Attorney Thomas
Foran. I guess you could say I’m
seated at his table. At the defense
table are the eight defendants
represented by their lawyers,
William Kunstler and Leonard
Weinglass. The defendants would
tell you they represent three
different groups. They would tell
you that one group-Excuse me.
Yes sir.

JUDGE HOFFMAN
SCHULTZ

JUDGE HOFFMAN
I’d like to clarify something for
the jurors. There are two Hoffmans
in this courtroom. The defendant,
Abbie Hoffman, and myself, Judge
Julius Hoffman.
There’s an awkward silence...is he done?
SCHULTZ
Thank you, sir.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I didn’t want there to be confusion
on the matter.

31.
ABBIE
Man, I don’t think there’s much
chance they’re going to mix us up.
The gallery LAUGHS a little...
JUDGE HOFFMAN
You will address this Court as
Judge or Your Honor and you will
not address this Court until--you
will not address this Court.
TOM is dying a little but stays cool.
SCHULTZ
The defendants would tell you they
represent three different groups.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
And the record should reflect that
defendant Hoffman and I aren’t
related.
Father no!

ABBIE

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Hoffman, are you familiar with
contempt of court?
ABBIE
It’s practically a religion for me,
sir.
The gallery LAUGHS and TOM adjusts in his chair.
SCHULTZ
(pause)
Your Honor?
Continue.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

SCHULTZ
Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden are the
leaders of the SDS--Students for a
Democratic Society. Hayden and
Davis brought their people to
Chicago for the purpose of causing
violence in the streets in order to
disrupt the Democratic Convention.
You know the Youth International
Party as the Yippies. Their leaders
are Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.
(MORE)

32.
SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
Bobby Seale is the leader of the
Black Panther Party. The defendants
would tell you these are three
distinct groups, but they’re all-BOBBY
(standing)
Excuse me.
Yes?

JUDGE HOFFMAN

BOBBY
May I speak?
No sir.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

BOBBY
He just said my name.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
You’re a defendant in this case,
you’re likely to hear your name.
BOBBY
I have a right to counsel and His
Honor knows that.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Don’t tell the Court what it does
and doesn’t know. Be seated.
BOBBY sits.
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
Mr. Schultz.
SCHULTZ
...the radical left, that’s all.
They’re the radical left in
different costumes. The eight
defendants had a plan. A plan among
two or more people is a conspiracy.
The defendants crossed state lines
to execute their plan, that’s why
we’re in federal court. The plan
was to incite a riot. And there’s
one thing you already know. They
succeeded.

33.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Excuse me. Have we identified the
other defendants for the record?
Mr. Weener?
Weiner.

WEINER

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Froines and Mr. Dillinger?
Dellinger.

DAVE

JUDGE HOFFMAN
(pause)
What is going on here?
SCHULTZ
You’re Honor, you’re referring to
the defendant Dellinger.
Derringer.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

SCHULTZ
Dellinger, sir.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Note the prosecution was referring
to the defendant Derringer, not
Dellinger.
KUNSTLER
It is Dellinger, Your Honor.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Can we straighten this out?
ABBIE
Dillinger was a bank robber,
Derringer is a gun, he’s David
Dellinger and the judge and I
aren’t related.
FORAN
Your Honor, I’d like to caution the
Court that this kind of disruption
and display of disrespect will be a
continuing tactic for defense.

34.
KUNSTLER
Sir, it’s not a tactic. At the
moment, the defendants are the only
ones on record as knowing their own
names.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Be seated, Mr. Schultz.
(correcting himself)
Mr. Kunstler.
BOBBY
(standing)
I object to being characterized as
a member of this group.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Who is your lawyer?
BOBBY
Charles R. Garry.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Is Mr. Garry here today?
BOBBY
No he’s not.
KUNSTLER
Your Honor-JUDGE HOFFMAN
Are you representing Mr. Seale?
No sir.

KUNSTLER

FRED HAMPTON leans forward and whispers something to BOBBY...
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Then sit. Mr. Schultz, forgive me,
have you concluded your opening
statement?
SCHULTZ
Yes, Your Honor.
BOBBY
My lawyer, Charles Garry, is in a
hospital in Oakland having
undergone gallbladder surgery.

35.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Kunstler, you’re sitting right
next to the man, just represent
him. It’s the same case.
KUNSTLER
The fact that there’s a lawyer near
Mr. Seale doesn’t satisfy the
requirements of due process.
BOBBY
I have a right-KUNSTLER
(putting his hand up to
BOBBY)
A motion was made for postponement
due to Mr. Garry’s medical
condition. I was there. Your Honor
denied that motion and therefore
Mr. Seale is here without legal
representation.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I don’t care for your general tone,
Mr. Kunstler.
KUNSTLER
I meant no disrespect to the Court,
sir. I’m trying to be clear that I
can’t muddy Mr. Seale’s grounds
for appeal by appearing to speak as
his lawyer.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I don’t ask you to compromise Mr.
Seale’s position, sir, but I will
not permit him to address the jury
with his very competent lawyer
seated-Out of nowhere-JERRY
Jesus Christ, for the fourth time,
he’s not Bobby’s lawyer!
This was TOM’s nightmare.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
You’re Mr. Rubin?
Yes sir.

JERRY

36.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Don’t ever do that again.
BOBBY
Your Honor, I’m not with these
guys. I never even met most of them
until-JUDGE HOFFMAN
We’ll have order.
BOBBY
--the indictment.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
We will have order.
BOBBY
There are eight of us and there are
signs out there that say “Free the
Chicago 7”--I’m not with them.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Marshal, will you seat Mr.
Seale?
We see a WHITE MARSHAL whisper to a BLACK MARSHAL in the back
of the courtroom--the BLACK MARSHAL heads down the aisle
toward Bobby as Bobby continues-BOBBY
You’re saying it’s a conspiracy. I
never met most of them until the
indictment. Speaking frankly, the
U.S. Attorney wanted a Negro
defendant to scare the jury. I was
thrown in to make the group look
scarier. I came to Chicago, I gave
a speech, I had a chicken pot pie,
went to the airport and flew back
to Oakland and that’s why they call
the eight of us the Chicago-(to the MARSHAL)
--get your hands off me.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Charge Mr. Seale with one count of
Contempt of Court.
Off of TOM’s barely-hidden frustration we

INT. DEFENSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

42

This is the room where the defendants will meet privately
with their lawyers during recesses. There’s a carton of deli
sandwiches on the table and some cokes.
The defendants and lawyers are filing in. TOM’s the last one
in and he slams the door behind himself, which gets
everyone’s attention.
TOM
We have to make a decision right
now--a decision I just assumed we’d
already made four months ago when
trial prep began. Are we using this
trial to defend ourselves against
very serious charges that could
land us in prison for 10 years or
are we using it to say a pointless
fuck you to the establishment?
Fuck you.

JERRY

TOM
That’s what I was afraid--Wait, I
don’t know if you were saying “fuck
you” or answering the question.
ABBIE
I was also confused.
JERRY
If we leave here without saying
anything about why we came in the
first place, it’ll be
heartbreaking.
TOM
If the jury finds us guilty we’re
not gonna be leaving here at all.
And the only thing we need to say
about why we came is that it wasn’t
to incite violence.
DAVE
I’m with Jerry.

Why?

TOM
(beat)

DAVE
The trial shouldn’t be about us.

38.
TOM
I would love it if it wasn’t about
us but it definitely is.
John? Lee?
Yeah.
Yes sir.

FROINES
WEINER

TOM
Do you guys want to say anything?
WEINER
Does anyone think our judge might
be crazy?
TOM
The judge isn’t our problem.
FROINES
Give it time ‘cause I think he’s
gonna be.
TOM
I’m talking about us. Abbie, you
can’t talk back to the judge. And
Jerry--Jesus.
ABBIE
(finally speaking up)
Did you get a haircut just for
court?
TOM
(pause)
I did.
ABBIE
You did. You got a haircut for the
judge. That’s--I can’t even--that
is so foreign to me.
So’s soap.
Zing.

TOM
ABBIE

TOM
Let me explain something--it took
you two less than five minutes to
make us look exactly like what
Schultz is trying to make us look
like.
JERRY
I don’t have a problem with what we
look like.
ABBIE
Jerry likes what we look like.
John? Lee?
Yeah.

WEINER
I always feel like I’m ten-pounds
too heavy, but yeah.
Dave?

ABBIE

DAVE
I don’t like when we fight.
Rennie?

ABBIE

RENNIE
Tom should be heard.
ABBIE
And he was. But when we walked in
here this morning they were
chanting that the whole world is
watching. This is it, we’re on.
This is what revolution’s gonna
look like. Real revolution.
Cultural revolution.
TOM
Why did you come here?
ABBIE
I got an invitation from a grand
jury.
TOM
Last summer. Why did you come to
the convention?

40.
ABBIE
To end the war.
TOM
Guys, before you tether yourselves
to this man, just know that the
very last thing he wants is for the
war to end.
Hang on--

DAVE

TOM
I don’t have time for cultural
revolution. It distracts from
actual revolution.
KUNSTLER
Alright, did everybody get
everything off their chests?
The door opens and FRED HAMPTON comes in-FRED
(to KUNSTLER)
What in the name of hell was that?!
KUNSTLER
Evidently not.
FRED
You stood up and spoke for Bobby.
KUNSTLER
I made it very clear I’m not his
lawyer.
FRED
I’d like to sit in on these
meetings.
You can’t.

KUNSTLER

FRED
I think I will anyway.
Fred--

KUNSTLER

FRED
Bobby’s life is at stake and you
guys are playin’ to the crowd?

41.

Thank you.

TOM

FRED
Shut up. The white guys are in a
furnished room while Bobby’s in a
holding cell.
KUNSTLER
The white guys are free on bail.
Bobby’s locked up ‘cause he’s under
arrest in Connecticut for killing a
cop, it’s not like he refused to
give up his seat on a bus.
WEINGLASS
You have to convince him to let
Bill and me represent him, just for
today at least.
KUNSTLER
The judge is-JERRY
Fuckin’ nuts.
KUNSTLER
--a little hostile, and I’m sure
Garry didn’t anticipate that.
FRED
(pause)
He’s innocent in Connecticut.
Alright.

KUNSTLER

FRED
He’s never killed anyone. It’s
important you all know that.
KUNSTLER
You have to try to convince him.
I can’t.
Try.

FRED
KUNSTLER

FRED
I have!

He needs to do it his way.

KUNSTLER
Keep trying, alright?
FRED nods.
A MARSHAL sticks his head in the door-MARSHAL
We’re back.
The MARSHAL exits.
KUNSTLER
Let’s go. Abbie, Jerry, unless
you’re asked a direct question,
shut your mouths while we’re in
that room.
ABBIE
(barely audible)
This is a political trial.
What?

KUNSTLER

ABBIE
This is a political trial. That was
already decided for us. Ignoring
that reality is just...weird to me.
KUNSTLER
There are civil trials and there
are criminal trials. There’s no
such thing as a political trial.
ABBIE
(beat--smiles)
Okay.
ABBIE heads out with everyone else. WEINGLASS stops TOM for a

INT. STAHL'S OFFICE - DAY
ABBIE
Mr. Stahl, you need to understand
something. There’s going to be a
Festival of Life in Grant Park and
it will be held during the
convention. Bands will play rock
music. There will be public
fornication, likely some of it with
the wives and mistresses of
delegates. Psychedelic long-haired
leftists will consort with dope
users. And we’re going to insist
that the next President of the
United States stop sending our
friends to be slaughtered. These
things are going to happen whether
you give us the permit or not.
STAHL looks at them for a long moment...

The hotel rooms will be filled with
delegates. Where will people sleep?

Some people will sleep in tents.
Others will live frivolously.

Okay, but the thing is, there will

Is that a threat, Mr. Hayden?
TOM
No. We’re cautioning you. Thousands
of people are coming to Chicago and
if they’re not given a place to
demonstrate they’re gonna
demonstrate wherever they’re

His name is Fred Hampton.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Let the record indicate that Mr.
Hampton is the head of the Chicago
chapter of the Black Panther Party.
KUNSTLER
Your Honor, Mr. Hampton isn’t at
the bar, why is the record
identifying him at all?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Hampton is clearly giving Mr.
Seale legal advice.
BOBBY
My lawyer is Charles Garry.
KUNSTLER
Excuse me, sir, but for all you
know Mr. Hampton is giving Mr.
Seale the score of the White Sox
game.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I will assume that he’s not.
Why?

KUNSTLER

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Because that’s what happens when
you don’t have a lawyer. The Court
assumes that you’re being
represented by the Black Panther
sitting behind you. Continue.
KUNSTLER
Mr. Stahl, when Abbie offered to
call the whole thing off for a
hundred-thousand dollars, did you
think he was serious or did you
think he was making a joke?

I had no reason not to think he was
serious.
Really?

Do you know what extortion is?
Yes.

Do you know that it’s a felony?

Okay, so when you called the FBI
and told them about Mr. Hoffman’s
attempt to extort a government
employee, what’d they say?
STAHL
I didn’t call the FBI.
KUNSTLER
Sorry, when you called the U.S.
Attorney and reported the attempted
extortion, what’d their office say?

I didn’t call the U.S.-KUNSTLER
Cook County D.A. then, did you call

outside the mayor’s office? How
‘bout the mayor? Mr. Stahl, I’m
going to ask you again. When Abbie
asked for a hundred-thousand
dollars to call the whole thing
off, did you think he was serious
or did you know it was a joke?
STAHL
I had no reason not to believe he
was serious.
KUNSTLER
Alright, and along with extortion,
you know that perjury’s a crime,
right?
Objection.

SCHULTZ

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Sustained and strike it. In fact,
strike the entirety of Mr. Stahl’s
testimony under cross-examination
and the jury is instructed to
disregard it.
KUNSTLER
You’re striking the entire crossexamination?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I gave you and co-counsel Feinglass
ample latitude to demonstrate
relevance and-KUNSTLER
Co-counsel’s name is Weinglass and
Mr. Stahl’s testimony under crossexamination was completely-JUDGE HOFFMAN
You’ve interrupted the court again,
Mr. Kunstler.
KUNSTLER

Move to reinstate testimony.

JUDGE HOFFMAN
KUNSTLER

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Noted. Are there any further
questions?
KUNSTLER
Yes sir. Mr. Stahl, in any of these
meetings, did any of the defendants
say that if you didn’t grant them
permits that they would do violent
acts to the city?
STAHL
Not precisely in that language.
KUNSTLER
Did they do it in any language?
STAHL
Yes, they said permits for the
parks should be issued in order to
minimize destruction.
KUNSTLER
Did they indicate from whom the
destruction would come?
STAHL
The destruction didn’t come from
the Chicago Police Department if
that’s what you’re suggesting.
KUNSTLER
I wasn’t suggesting that, you just
did. No more questions.
BOBBY
I’d like to cross-examine the
witness, Your Honor.

You may not.

The place is packed and smoke-filled and everyone is there to
see and hear ABBIE, who’s up on stage at the microphone. He
has a style onstage that’s not unlike Lenny Bruce.
We come in on a BIG LAUGH and APPLAUSE...
ABBIE
So Hayden’s in a holding cell on a
tire-pressure related charge and
suddenly every freak in Chicago is
mobilized. “They got Hayden, they
got Hayden.” We’re gonna march down
to the police station, overcome the
police and the Illinois National
Guard and free Tom Hayden.
(pause)
We couldn’t find our way out of the
park.
A BIG LAUGH...
ABBIE (CONT'D)
Over the course of 10 days, the

JERRY takes his drink and heads over to the woman.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Uh...Did you mean this for me?
I did.

DAPHNE

JERRY
Nobody’s ever sent me a drink
before.
DAPHNE
How do you like it so far?
JERRY
It’s a Tom Collins. I know it’s
kind of a country club drink but
they’re delicious. A man in England
named Tom Collins claimed in 1894
to have invented it, but then
another man who’s name I’ve
forgotten said, no, he’d invented
it two years earlier and I think
there was a lawsuit.
DAPHNE
That’s a surprising amount of
controversy for gin and lemonade.
I’m Jerry.

JERRY

DAPHNE
Hey Jerry, do you know why the
French only eat one egg for

What was your assignment in
Chicago?

SCHULTZ
What were the four of them doing?

DAPHNE
About eight-hundred.

Where were they leading these eighthundred people?
DAPHNE
To Police Headquarters at 11th and

EXT. GRANT PARK - DAY

Tear gas canisters get fired into the crowd as the POLICE
strap on gas masks. The POLICE move into the CROWD and start
swinging their clubs full force. The unlucky ones near the
gas emerge from the thick, grey dust blinded and gasping for
air. Others have blood spray from their foreheads and down
their mouths as they get struck in the face with clubs.
JERRY and RENNIE are trying to pull people away and send them
back down the hill.
We see the YOUNG WOMAN in the beret--she’s making her way
through the crowd, through the tear gas and up the hill.
Suddenly she’s tackled from behind by the three FRAT BOYS.
FRAT BOY #1
I told you to put that flag down,
go in the kitchen and make me a
fuckin’ sandwich!

93.
They grab her as she tries to escape. She’s screaming as
she’s smacked in the face and her shirt gets torn off.
Now JERRY sees this and starts flying toward her through the
crowd.
JERRY
Hey! What are you doin?! Get the
fuck offa her! What the fuck is the
matter with you?!
JERRY pulls one guy off-JERRY (CONT'D)
Get the fuck offa her!
FRAT BOY #2
Fuck you, hippie faggot!
And the punch that JERRY’s wanted to throw for years lands
square in the face of this guy, and just as quickly, JERRY’s
elbow breaks the nose of the guy’s buddy who’s about to help
him. The third guy goes running to avoid the tear gas that’s
just been shot into the area.
JERRY tends to the girl-JERRY
You’re alright. You’re okay.
JERRY pulls off his shirt-JERRY (CONT'D)
Here. You’re okay.
He takes a bandana from his pocket-JERRY (CONT'D)
You need to hold this over your
face and I’ll get you outa here.
But now there’s the sound of a gun locking behind JERRY’s
head. He puts his hands up without turning around-POLICEMAN
Don’t move, Jerry.
JERRY
Get those guys, they were-JERRY turns around--three POLICEMEN in gas masks have guns on
him...

Get your people to cool off. We’re

ABBIE
We have to protest in front of the

simple. ‘Cause that’s where the
cameras are. We have to get to the
convention. And that means we have
to leave the park. And that’s when
people’ll get hurt. As long as

JERRY
I took in the exhibit. I cleared my
mind. I stood there for twenty
minutes and I felt nothing.
ABBIE
Well...but it wasn’t a painting, it
was an exhibit. It was a natural
history museum.

JERRY
And when you put exhibits of Native
Indian families in a natural
history museum alongside dioramas
of early man and the Jurassic age,
it gives the impression that the
Cherokee evolved into modern day

share Abbie’s sentiment that you’re
a good guy, but I’m afraid I can’t.
SCHULTZ
I’m sorry to hear that.
JERRY
Sending Daphne O'Connor to break my
heart was way outa line.
SCHULTZ
Well I don’t work for the FBI but
Special Agent O'Connor was one of
many agents sent to gather
intelligence on what had been
deemed a credible domestic threat.
JERRY
Fine, then you bug our phones, you
wire up a dope dealer, be a man.
You don’t send a woman to ensorcell

gave a speech.
BOBBY speaks lifelessly, almost by rote-BOBBY
I object to this man’s testimony
against me because I’ve been denied
counsel.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
We understand.
SCHULTZ
Do you recall anything from Mr.
Seale’s speech?
FRAPOLY
Yes. He said--

BOBBY
I object to this man’s-Quiet.
Go ahead.

JUDGE HOFFMAN
SCHULTZ

FRAPOLY
May I refer to notes?
Yes sir.

SCHULTZ

FRAPOLY
He said, “We must understand that
as we go forth to try to move the
reprobate politicians-BOBBY
Your Honor-FRAPOLY
“--our cowardly Congress, the jive,
double-lip talkin’ Nixon--”
BOBBY
Jive double-lip talkin’ Nixon? You
make me sound like one funky cat,
thank you sir.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Last warning, Mr. Seale.
SCHULTZ
Did he say anything else?
FRAPOLY
He said, “The revolution at this
time is directly connected to
organized guns and force.”
SCHULTZ
No more questions.
BOBBY shakes his head to himself, then says simply and calmlyBOBBY
A jive, double-lip talkin’, funky,
funky cat.

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Would the defense like to crossexamine the witness?
BOBBY
Yes. I’m sitting here saying that I
would like to cross-JUDGE HOFFMAN
Only lawyers can address a wit-BOBBY
My lawyer is Charles Garry.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I’m tired of hearing that.
BOBBY
I couldn’t care less what you’re
tired of.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
What did you say?
BOBBY
I said it would be impossible for
me to care any less what you’re
tired of and I demand to crossexamine this-JUDGE HOFFMAN
Sit in your chair and be quiet and
don’t ever address the Court in
that-BOBBY turns to the GALLERY-BOBBY
(to the crowd)
It was premeditated murder. Fred
Hampton was assassinated last
night.
The GALLERY gasps-JUDGE HOFFMAN
Marshals, put Mr. Seale in his
seat.
BOBBY keeps talking as a few MARSHALS come to deal with him-BOBBY
He wouldn’t have been able to hold
a gun in his right hand.

BOBBY (CONT'D)
When they publish the coroner’s
report, make sure you ask about the
bullet wound in his wrist.
The MARSHAL’s have put BOBBY in his seat.

I strongly caution you, Mr. Seale,
I strongly caution you that-BOBBY
Oh strongly fuck yourself.

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Let the record show that I tried,
fairly and impartially, I tried to
get the defendant to sit on his
own. I ask you again, and you may
indicate by raising your head up
and down or moving it from side to
side, if I have your assurance that
you will not do anything to disrupt
this trial if I allow you to resume
proper order.
BOBBY doesn’t move...just looks at him...
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
Do I have your assurance?
BOBBY looks at the judge and gently shakes his head “no”...

Mr. Schultz, call your next
witness.
SCHULTZ doesn’t move...nobody does...

utter such a thing.

Yes. Just--please sir.

separated from the other defendants
and that a mistrial be declared in
his case.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
You want me to give him his
mistrial?
KUNSTLER
You took their black guy and made
him a sympathetic character.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I’ve lived a long time and you’re
the first person who’s ever
suggested that I’ve discriminated
against a black man.
WEINGLASS
Then let the record show that I’m
the second.
JUDGE HOFFMAN

Step back.
The lawyers return to their tables.
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)

mistrial as to the defendant Bobby

CHEERS go up in the courtroom.

Mr. Seale, you’re currently charged
with 16 counts of contempt for your
repeated displays of disrespect,

WEINGLASS looks over. KUNSTLER walks to the black sedan and

INT. STUDY - DAY

RAMSEY CLARK, in khakis and a button-down shirt, is sitting
with two men in dark suits, one of whom we recognize as
HOWARD from John Mitchell’s office. Framed photos are on the
wall of Clark with LBJ in the Oval Office, with Bobby Kennedy
and from his days as a Marine.
CLARK is both laid back and completely in control. He gets up
to greet his visitors.
CLARK
Hey, Bill, Ramsey Clark.
KUNSTLER
Pleased to meet you, sir, this is
Leonard Weinglass.
CLARK
(shaking hands)
Mr. Weinglass.
KUNSTLER
And Tom Hayden.
CLARK
I know who Tom Hayden is, the FBI
used to work for me. These two men
are senior deputies with the
Justice Department--Mr. Calley and
Mr. Howard.
KUNSTLER
I don’t know what these men are
doing here.
CLARK
I invited them.
KUNSTLER
(pause)
You invited them?
CLARK
I don’t want any appearance of
impropriety.
KUNSTLER
There isn’t any impropriety.

119.
CLARK
And now there are witnesses to
that.
KUNSTLER’s at a loss. He’s screwed before he even got
started...
KUNSTLER
(pause)
Sir, these men are going to call
Schultz and Foran as soon as we’re
done here.
CLARK
Don’t be ridiculous, they’ve
already called Schultz and Foran
and they’re gonna call John
Mitchell as soon as we’re done
here. Ask what you want to ask.
KUNSTLER
In front of them?
Mm-hm.

CLARK

KUNSTLER takes a breath...
KUNSTLER
(pause)
Alright. Mr. Clark, while you were
the Attorney General for President
Johnson, was there ever a
discussion with the White House
about seeking indictments against
my clients?
HOWARD
He can’t answer that.
Why not?

KUNSTLER

HOWARD
It’s against the law.
WEINGLASS
That’s an overly broad
interpretation of the law.
KUNSTLER
That’s Lenny’s way of saying you’re
criminally full of shit, Deputy
Howard.

120.

Sir--

HOWARD

KUNSTLER
And I’ll tell you what--We’ve dealt
with jury tampering, wire tapping,
a defendant who was literally
gagged and a judge who’s been
handing down rulings from the bench
that would be considered wrong in
Honduras!--so I’m less interested
in the law than I was when this
trial began.
HOWARD
Whether you like the law or not, as
a former A.G. he’s protected by it.
KUNSTLER
No, you’re protected by it-(to CLARK)
--and due respect, sir, I can
subpoena you.
HOWARD
Find a judge in this circuit who’ll
sign that subpoena.
CLARK
He’s right. And taking the stand
voluntarily would be a big risk for
me.
KUNSTLER
Again, due respect, but my clients
take a much bigger risk when they-CLARK
What took you so long?
KUNSTLER
(beat)
--when they stand up against
enormous power they can’t see and-I’m sorry, what took me so long to
do what?
CLARK
To realize I’m your star witness?
KUNSTLER’s a little thrown now...

121.
KUNSTLER
(beat)
Well...we were...remarking on that
ourselves, but-Bill--

CLARK

HOWARD
He can’t testify.
CLARK
I’m in private practice now and if
John Mitchell wants to cut me in
half, he can and he will.
TOM
You have to find--Sir, you have to
find some courage now and
CLARK
Find some courage, yeah.
TOM
Yes--You have to find some courage
and--

Tom.

WEINGLASS
(holding a hand up)

CLARK
That’s what these two men came to
tell me. That if John Mitchell
wants to cut me in half, he can and
he will. So I wanted them here in
the room when I said--When do you
want me in court?
The room freezes for a moment...
HOWARD
Mr. Clark-I’m sorry?

KUNSTLER

CLARK
Swear me in, Bill.
HOWARD
It’s against the law for you to
testify, Ramsey, it’s that simple.

CLARK
It’s General Clark and arrest me or
shut the fuck up.

Found it.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
TITLE:
Trial Day 124
KUNSTLER
The defense calls Ramsey Clark.
SCHULTZ
Your Honor, the People move to
disallow this witness.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I’d like the marshals to take the
jury from the room.
As the marshals lead the jury out of the room we see that
HOWARD and CALLEY are in the gallery now--poker faced.
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
Mr. Schultz?
SCHULTZ
The Code of Federal Regulations
mandates that the disclosure of
Justice Department material is
prohibited without prior knowledge
of the Attorney General--plainly
meaning the sitting Attorney
General--who is John Mitchell who
has specifically denied his
approval.
WEINGLASS
Judge, the rule refers to very
specific kinds of documents and
information. If the regulation was
interpreted as Mr. Schultz is
asking it to be, nobody in the
federal government would ever be
able to testify in a trial after
leaving their job.

162

123.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I think the government is at least
justified in asking the defense to
demonstrate by voir dire the
testimony it expects to illicit
from the witness.
KUNSTLER
You’d like us to question the
witness outside the presence of the
jury?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
If I find any of the testimony
relevant I’ll call the jury back in
to hear it.
(pause)
Take it or leave it, Mr. Kunstler.
KUNSTLER doesn’t have a choice...
KUNSTLER
Defense calls Ramsey Clark.
CLARK steps to the witness box where the BAILIFF is ready
with a Bible.
BAILIFF
State your name.
CLARK
William Ramsey Clark.
BAILIFF
Do you swear that the testimony you
give will be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.

CLARK

KUNSTLER
Mr. Clark, what was your occupation
in the summer of 1968?
CLARK
I was Attorney General of the
United States.
KUNSTLER
You were appointed by President
Johnson.

124.

Yes.

CLARK

KUNSTLER
And confirmed by the United States
Senate.
Yes.

CLARK

KUNSTLER
Did you receive a phone call at
your office at 11:50 A.M. On
September 10th of last year?
Yes.

CLARK

KUNSTLER
From whom was the call?
CLARK
President Johnson.
KUNSTLER
Will you state what President
Johnson said to you and what was
said to him?
SCHULTZ
Your Honor, at this point we’ll
object. A cabinet officer does not
have to and should not have to
relate the contents a private call
he had with the President.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
I’ll sustain the objection.
KUNSTLER
Please the court, this is voir
dire, I thought objections were
reserved.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
There’s a question of
attorney/client privilege to
consider.
CLARK
The president isn’t a client of the
Attorney General.

125.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
(beat)
Excuse me, sir?
CLARK
The president isn’t a client of the
Attorney General. I’m happy to
answer.
There’s a moment of awkward silence...
SCHULTZ
Your Honor, I don’t--hearing from
the witness on this point is highly
irregular.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
(pause)
Well gentlemen, I’m...This is my
courtroom but the witness is the
former--he’s--and he’s just stated
his willingness, you know--so for
the purposes of voir dire I’ll hear
the answer.
CLARK
The President asked me if I
intended to seek any indictments
related to the riots the previous
month in Chicago.
KUNSTLER
And what did you tell him?
CLARK
I told him we wouldn’t be seeking
indictments.
KUNSTLER
Can you tell us why?
CLARK
An investigation by our criminal
division led to the clear
conclusion that the riots were
started by the Chicago Police
Department.
The DEFENDANTS--except TOM and RENNIE--along with many in the
gallery jump up and CHEER, banging the table and shouting.
KUNSTLER gives them a look as JUDGE HOFFMAN gavels the room
to order.

126.
KUNSTLER
Did your counter-intelligence
division make a report as well.
CLARK
They concluded that there had been
no conspiracy on the part of the
defendants to incite violence
during the convention.
KUNSTLER
What happened on the first Tuesday
after the first Monday in November
of that year?
CLARK
Richard Nixon was elected
president.
Sustained.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

KUNSTLER
(beat)
Nobody objected.
SCHULTZ
We do. It’s well known that there’s
no love lost between the witness
and the sitting Attorney General.
The witness has been called to wage
a political attack and he should
not be allowed to appear before the
jury.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Kunstler?
KUNSTLER
Your Honor can’t possibly be
considering not allowing the jury
to hear what we’ve just heard.
SCHULTZ
The witness can’t present to them
testimony that will assist in
making a determination of guilt or
innocence.
KUNSTLER
He just testified that his own
Justice Department came to the
conclusion--

127.
SCHULTZ
And the current Justice Department-the only one that matters--came to
a new conclu-KUNSTLER
And therefore the motivation of the
prosecution is now called into-SCHULTZ
The motivation of the prosecution
isn’t an issue in a courtroom.
KUNSTLER
Not any courtroom I’ve ever been in
except this one!
Object!

FORAN

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Kunstler, do you have any
further examination that will
demonstrate that this witness will
make a material contribution or
should I ask him to step down?
KUNSTLER
You’ve ruled? You’re not going to
let the jury hear his testimony?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Not unless you can demonstrate to
me, which you have not thus far
done, that this witnessYes sir.

KUNSTLER

KUNSTLER gathers himself, then says quietly to the COURT
REPORTER-KUNSTLER (CONT'D)
(quietly)
Are you any good?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Are you addressing the Court
Reporter?
KUNSTLER
(quietly)
Keep up with us..

128.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Kunstler.
Like a speed drill-KUNSTLER
(to CLARK)
Is this prosecution politically
motivated?
Object!
Yes.

SCHULTZ
CLARK

KUNSTLER
President Nixon inherited an
unpopular war?
Yes.

CLARK

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Step down please, Mr. Clark.
CLARK
And your clients are making it more
unpopular every day.
KUNSTLER
The administration’s paranoid about
the SDS, the MOBE, the New Left?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Mr. Clark, please.
(beat)
Please, I’ll be forced to find you
in Contempt. You understand.
CLARK
(pause)
I do, Your Honor.
KUNSTLER
(pause)
Thank you, sir.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
You may step down.
CLARK gets up, shares a look with KUNSTLER, and exits...

129.
KUNSTLER
Your Honor, when the jury returns,
will they be informed that the
defense had called the former
Attorney General but that the Court
ruled he couldn’t testify?
JUDGE HOFFMAN
No, that motion will be denied.
KUNSTLER goes back to his table. Then he absently picks up a
heavy law book and SLAMS it on the table with a BANG.
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
Cite Mr. Kunstler with his third
count of Contempt.
DAVE
(quietly)
You’re a thug.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Did one of the defendants speak?
DAVE

I did. I said you’re a thug and you
are.
TOM

Dave-JUDGE HOFFMAN
Please sit, Mr. Dellinger.
DAVE
If we’re guilty, why not give us a
trial? If we’re-JUDGE HOFFMAN
Marshals, seat the defendant.

If we’re guilty, then why not give
us a trial? I’ve sat here for six
months and watched you-(to a MARSHAL)
I’m asking you not to grab-But A DIFFERENT MARSHAL grabs him. DAVE throws his arm off,
then punches him in the face, sending the MARSHAL to the
floor.
It all happened too fast.
The GALLERY and the DEFENDANTS jump up as the MARSHALS jump
up as DAVE’s taken down by the other MARSHALS then dragged to
his feet with his arms twisted behind him.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Take him outa here. Lock him up!
As DAVE gets handcuffed, he looks to the back of the
courtroom where his young son is looking at him.
DAVE

I hit him. I’m sorry.
The MARSHALS have him out the door.

to do. Solidarity with Dave.
Tomorrow we go into court and get
ourselves arrested.
TOM
We’re already arrested.
JERRY
(pause)
Is Bill talking to you about taking
the stand?
(beat)
(MORE)

131.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Some of the press guys are saying
Bill’s been talking to you about
taking the stand.
TOM
He’s been talking to me about it.
JERRY
He thinks you might get the crowd
worked up with a position paper?
TOM
Maybe he thinks I won’t try to get
the crowd worked up at all. Maybe
he thinks there are jurors who’ve
relied on the safety of the police
and are put off when someone calls
them pigs. Or maybe he just wants a
witness who dresses like a grown
man.
JERRY
The cops in this city in the summer
of 1968 were pigs.
TOM
I wonder how many of them have kids
in Vietnam.
JERRY
(to ABBIE)
He’s gonna take the stand, not you?
(beat)
We’re okay with that?
ABBIE’s lost in thought...
Abbie!

JERRY (CONT'D)

ABBIE
(to TOM)
What did you mean the last thing I
want is to end the war?
TOM
(long pause)
What?

132.
ABBIE
Like...50 years ago when the trial
started you said, “Why did you come
to Chicago?” and I said, “To end
the war”, and you turned to
everyone and said, “The last thing
he wants is to end the war.” What
did you mean by that?
TOM
I meant that you’re making the most
of your close-up.
Yeah?

ABBIE

TOM
No more war, no more Abbie Hoffman.
ABBIE
What’s your problem with me,
Hayden?
TOM
I really wish people would stop
asking me that question.
RENNIE
Hey, Dave wouldn’t want us to
fight.
ABBIE
Answer it. One time.
TOM
Alright. For the next 50 years,
when people think of progressive
politics, they’re gonna think of
you. They’re gonna think of you and
your idiot followers passing out
daisies to soldiers and trying to
levitate the Pentagon. They’re not
gonna think of equality or justice,
they’re not gonna think of
education or poverty or progress.
They’re gonna think of a bunch of
stoned, lost, disrespectful, foulmouthed, lawless losers. And so
we’ll lose elections.
ABBIE
All because of me.

133.

Mm-hm.

TOM

ABBIE
And winning elections, that’s the
first thing on your wish list?
Equality, justice, education,
poverty and progress--they’re
second?
TOM
If we don’t win elections it
doesn’t matter what’s second and
it’s astonishing that someone still
has to explain that to you.
There’s a long silence...
RENNIE
(pause)
Okay, so Jerry was talking about-ABBIE
(quietly)
We don’t have any money.
I’m sorry?

TOM

ABBIE
We don’t have any money. So I stage
stunts and cameras come,
microphones come. And it’s
astonishing that someone still has
to explain that to you.
TOM
You’re trading a cow for magic
beans.
JERRY
That ended up working.
What?

TOM

JERRY
The magic beans. There was a giant
up there. I can’t remember what
happened after that, the little boy
may have gotten eaten.

134.
FROINES
No, the giant turned out to be
nice.
JERRY
Are you sure?
No.

FROINES

WEINER
It’s almost hard to believe the
seven of us weren’t able to end a
war.
ABBIE
(to TOM)
Lemme ask you something.
RENNIE
You guys should just shake hands.
ABBIE
You think Chicago would’ve gone
differently if Kennedy got the
nomination?
TOM
Do I think-(laughs a little)
Yes, it--yes. The Irish guys would
have sat down with Daley and--yes.
ABBIE
I think so too.
Yeah.

TOM

ABBIE
That’s why I was wondering--weren’t
you just a little bit happy when
the bullet ripped through his head?
(beat)
No Chicago, no Tom Hayden.
TOM looks at ABBIE for a moment in stunned disbelief, then
lunges at him-TOM
I WAS ONE OF HIS PALLBEARERS!
Everyone immediately reacts--

135.
ABBIE
(pushing him off)
That’s right!
(beat)
We’re not going to jail because of
what we did, we’re going to jail
because of who we are. Think about
that the next time you shrug off
cultural revolution. We define
winning differently you and me.
KUNSTLER comes in with WEINGLASS.
ABBIE (CONT'D)
Bill, you shoulda seen it. Tom
tried to beat me up but through
sheer of force of intellectual
superiority-KUNSTLER
Stop talking.
(beat)
Just stop talking.
KUNSTLER reaches into his bag and pulls out an envelope.
KUNSTLER (CONT'D)
Foran’s office turned this over
tonight in discovery. It was given
to them by somebody in the crowd.
KUNSTLER’s taken a reel-to-reel tape out of the envelope.
KUNSTLER (CONT'D)
No foul play, there are affidavits,
they really did just get this.
TOM
What’s on the tape?
KUNSTLER
The sound of you starting the
Chicago riot.
KUNSTLER goes into the living room and everyone follows.
TOM
(pause)
What?
KUNSTLER
Somebody had a tape recorder at the
band shell.
(MORE)

136.
KUNSTLER (CONT'D)
They’ve got you saying it. It’s a
clear tape. You can’t take the
stand.
TOM
I can handle Schultz and the tape.
No.

KUNSTLER

TOM
They’re going to play the tape
anyway, right?
KUNSTLER
If you take the stand they’ll make
you answer for it and you can’t.
TOM
They’d just cracked Rennie’s head
open.
KUNSTLER
So you started a riot--defense
rests.
TOM
They’d just cracked-KUNSTLER
“If blood is going to flow--”
Bill--

TOM

KUNSTLER
“--let it flow all over the city.”
TOM
They’d just clubbed Rennie.
KUNSTLER
Everybody kept their cool. Abbie,
Dave, shit-(pointing to JERRY)
--this guy kept his cool! You’re
the one who lost it.
TOM
I can take the stand.
KUNSTLER
You want to hear what the cross
from Schultz is gonna sound like?

137.
TOM
Sure. I’ll show you what my
answers’ll sound like.
164

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

164

A giant CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS is listening to DAVE introduce
a speaker. TOM, ABBIE and JERRY are standing off to the side
on stage. RENNIE’s way in the back of the crowd.
DAVE
They called him a radical. They
called him a criminal. They called
him un-American.
In the back of the crowd, RENNIE looks to his left where a
young guy is starting to climb a flagpole.
TOM, from the stage, looks to the back of the crowd and sees
the same thing.
TOM (V.O.)
First of all, it turned out the guy
climbing the flagpole was a kid.
165

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT
KUNSTLER
It seems like you guys attract an
awful lot of underage minors.
TOM
(to WEINGLASS)
You want to object?
Objection.
Overruled.

WEINGLASS
KUNSTLER

TOM
We attract the people who have the
most to lose by this war
continuing.
KUNSTLER
I’m glad you brought that up. Did
you serve?

165

138.
TOM
I wasn’t drafted. I didn’t try to
evade the--I had a high number.
KUNSTLER
But you didn’t enlist.
TOM
I did not volunteer to kill
Vietnamese people, no.
KUNSTLER
You testified that you saw at least
six policemen start to go after the
man--sorry, kid--who was climbing
the flagpole.
Yes.

TOM

KUNSTLER
It was dark and you were a hundred
yards away. Do you have telescopic
night vision?
TOM
There were floodlights.
166

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

166

DAVE
And when they called him antiAmerican. He said, “No. That
ignominious distinction goes to
those who mouth American values-POLICEMEN in the back of the crowd see the kid climbing the
flagpole and move in to stop him.
RENNIE and a few others dive into the police, trying to get
them to stop.
DAVE (CONT'D)
--while breaking America’s heart.”
RENNIE
(shouting)
Hey! It’s alright! He’s a kid!
We’ll get him down!
From the stage, TOM can see that a little trouble’s started--

139.
DAVE
I’d like to introduce you now to
Carl Oglesby of the SDS.

TOM
(to himself)
Shit.
167

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT
And?

KUNSTLER

TOM
The police were shoving Rennie
away.
168

EXT. GRANT PARK/FLAG POLE - NIGHT

OFFICER
This doesn’t concern you!
RENNIE
Just leave the kid alone! He’ll
come down!
OFFICER #2
I know who you are! Step back!
A169

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT
TOM
Rennie was just trying to get the
police off of the kid.
KUNSTLER
Get the police off of the kid.
Yes.
How?
He was--

TOM
KUNSTLER
TOM

KUNSTLER
--grabbing them?

B169

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

B169

TOM’s watching helplessly as this develops. The OFFICERS have
the kid pinned against the flagpole now and an OFFICER
punches the kid in the groin as hard as he can. Then does it
again.
Jesus!

RENNIE

RENNIE grabs the OFFICER and pulls him off the kid--

A nightstick cracks RENNIE across the face, sending blood
flying.
B170

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

B170

TOM
It was six armed police officers
versus Rennie Davis and a pocket
protector so I can understand that
response.
KUNSTLER
How ‘bout your response. Let’s
press “Play”.
KUNSTLER has a small reel-to-reel tape recorder out now and
hits “play”. It’s a crude recording but we HEAR FROINES-170

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT
FROINES steps to the microphone-FROINES
I’d like to say to the police back
there that we have--we’re allowed
to be here, we have a permit for-we need medics back there.

170

141.
The camera is PUSHING IN ON TOM. People have limits and TOM’s
coming face to face with his.
171

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

Back to the tape recording-KUNSTLER
Dellinger tried to stop you from
saying what you were about to say
to the crowd.
172

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

172

DAVE comes over to TOM-TOM
Rennie’s been beaten.
DAVE
We can--listen to me--we can still
get everybody out of here safely.
TOM
No we can’t.
DAVE
Tell ‘em to stay calm.
No.

TOM

DAVE
They’ll listen to you.
173

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

173

KUNSTLER
Did you tell ‘em to stay calm?
A174

INT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT
TOM takes over the microphone from FROINES-TOM
Rennie Davis has just been beaten
by the police! Rennie’s skull has
been cracked open.

KUNSTLER
Did you tell your crowd to stay
calm or did you-Bill--

TOM

KUNSTLER
I’m Richard Schultz and John
Mitchell told me to win, Tom. Did
you tell your crowd to stay calm or
did you say-TOM
Yes. Absolutely. If blood is going
to flow-174

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

174

TOM
(shouting into the
microphone)
--let it flow all over the city!
DAVE
Goddammit Tom!
TOM
(into the microphone)
If gas is going to be used, let it
come down all over Chicago! We’re
going to the Convention!
The CROWD REACTION, which has been building wildly in volume,
has reached a crescendo-TOM (CONT'D)
Let’s get on the street! Get on the
street!
175

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT
KUNSTLER
“If blood is going to flow, let it
flow all over the city.” Was that
an order to start a peaceful
demonstration?

175

143.
176

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

176

And now we’re on the backs of a line of riot police who are
climbing up the back of a hill in the dark. They get to the
crest of the hill and we see what they see--an ARMY OF
PROTESTORS coming right toward them.
177

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

177

KUNSTLER
Once you’d had a moment to settle
down, did you try top stop people?
178

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT

178

The ARMY OF PROTESTORS is getting closer to the BATTALION OF
RIOT POLICE. We HEAR a RADIO COMMAND and-BAM--tear gas gets shot into the crowd.
BAM BAM BAM--more tear gas gets fired.
We see TIGHT IMAGES of protestors getting cracked in their
heads and across their faces by police batons.
179

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

179

KUNSTLER
You didn’t try to stop anyone.
No.
180

TOM

EXT. GRANT PARK - NIGHT
We see bloody faces on the ground as the feet of the
protestors move by.
TOM is going through the crowd and directing them-TOM
(shouting)
The bridges! Head to the bridges!
The bridges!

180

144.
181

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

181

KUNSTLER
You were the one who told people to
go to the footbridges.
TOM
The ones who were able to make it
out of the park without getting
arrested or maimed.
KUNSTLER
And those people, the ones you sent
to the footbridges, did they know
what was waiting for them on the
other side?

182

EXT. FOOTBRIDGE - NIGHT

182

A few hundred protestors who made it through the battalion of
riot police come into view at one end of a footbridge
connecting to Michigan Avenue.
Headlights come into view from the other direction and we see
that the source of the headlights are a moving wall of five
Jeeps outfitted with concertina wire in front.
183

EXT. ANOTHER FOOTBRIDGE - SAME TIME

183

Another group of protestors meets a moving line of NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN with bayonets.

A third group of protestors meet armored vehicles covered
with NATIONAL GUARDSMEN.
185

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT
KUNSTLER
All access to the convention was
blocked.
TOM
By an armored division.

185

145.
KUNSTLER
Of the Illinois National Guard,
they’re the good guys.
TOM
Jeeps fitted with concertina wire
called Daley Dozers, and when did I
stop being one of the good guys?
KUNSTLER
Let’s find out. Were glass bottles
being thrown at the police?
A186

EXT. FIRST FOOTBRIDGE - NIGHT

A186

We see glass bottles flying through the air and crashing on
the street in front of the police.
Shit, no!

DAVE

DAVE starts making his way through the crowd-DAVE (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Don’t throw anything! Drop the
bottles! Don’t throw anything!
B186

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT (FILE FOOTAGE)
TOM
Some people threw bottles. Dave was
the one trying to shut it down.
They were frustrated--all three
footbridges were--

KUNSTLER
You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
eluded the police.
TOM
I wouldn’t say we eluded them, I’d
say we were fleeing from them.
KUNSTLER
You found an unguarded bridge.

EXT. SMALL FOOTBRIDGE - NIGHT

TOM, ABBIE, JERRY and 15 others are standing on one end of a
dark, empty bridge that’s only protected by a police

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

189

ABBIE
In the lobby of the Hilton, right
next to the Convention Center, is a
bar called the Haymarket Tavern.
The Haymarket Tavern is a watering
hole for Chicago’s political class
and their hookers. And the place
was packed to watch Humphrey
getting the nomination a mile away.
190

INT. HAYMARKET TAVERN - NIGHT

190

The place is crowded with lawyers and their dates who are
partying it up. On the television sets we can see and hear
the roll call vote being taken.
One side of the bar is a floor-to-ceiling picture window.

TOM, ABBIE, JERRY and the others have just about crossed to
the other side of an intersection clogged with police
barricades, police vehicles, ambulances, etc., to a darker
place on the street.

guard and you’re in sight of the
Convention Center-194

EXT. HAYMARKET TAVERN - NIGHT

TOM, ABBIE, JERRY and the others are on a dark, empty
sidewalk.
A few riot police appear from around the corner. The group
turns in the other direction where more riot police appear.
195

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT
TOM
Where we got trapped.
KUNSTLER
What’s another word for trapped?
TOM
We were trapped between the window
and the police.
KUNSTLER
What’s another word for trapped?
(beat)
“Caught”, right?

148.

TOM, ABBIE, JERRY and the others are basically pinned against
the picture window by the riot police who are coming closer.
197

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

ABBIE
Inside the bar it’s like the 60’s
never happened. Outside the bar,
the 60’s were being performed for
anyone who looked out the window.
198

INT. HAYMARKET TAVERN - NIGHT

198

The roll call continues on the television sets and the
festive mood continues. A WOMAN looks out the window and
notices the backs of the protestors that are out there. Her
date is deep in conversation-BAR PATRON #1
Does anyone know what a buckeye is?

Hey.

WOMAN
(trying to get his
attention)

A buckeye?
Yeah.

BAR PATRON #2
BAR PATRON #1

WOMAN
Am I the only one who sees what’s
going on out there?
BAR PATRON #2
A buckeye is a nut. A poisonous
nut.
We see a few other people near the window are starting to
notice what’s going on outside.
199

ABBIE
And we see a cop do something you
don’t ever want to see a cop do.

We PUSH IN on TOM as he sees a RIOT OFFICER pull off his
badge and then his name tag and put them in a pocket. ABBIE
watches as the another RIOT OFFICER pulls off their badge and
name tag. JERRY watches another.

All those people, how come you and
Abbie and Jerry are the only ones
who saw them do that?
TOM
I don’t know. It was dark. People
were scared.

60’s outside the bar. 50’s inside

unnecessary metaphor.

KUNSTLER
You overrun the riot police-And now TOM and KUNSTLER begin talking over each other at the
same time--

205

KUNSTLER (CONT'D)
--make it past the tear gas,
make it past the national
guard, find an open bridge,
you can practically reach
your hand out and touch the
convention and you gave
yourself up peacefully?

TOM
(simultaneously)
Which is more than Rennie can
say! Over 400 people admitted
to area hospitals with severe
injuries! They had armored
vehicles! Bayonets! They took
off their name tags and
badges! We were trying to
protest peacefully at the
fucking convention!

INT. HAYMARKET TAVERN - NIGHT

205

TOM is sitting on the floor in the rubble and the
aftermath...He sees ABBIE sitting against a wall in
handcuffs...They’re both bleeding and they share a look of
defeat...

Hands behind your back.
TOM
(pause)
Yeah.
206

INT. CONSPIRACY OFFICE - NIGHT

KUNSTLER
Who started the riot, Tom?
TOM is spent. After a moment he says a word that doesn’t mean
to make sense by itself...
TOM
(pause)
“Our”.
KUNSTLER
(pause)
What?

151.
TOM
(beat)
“Our”. “Our blood”.
ABBIE puts it together...
ABBIE
(pause)
“Our” blood. If “our” blood is
going to flow--you meant to say,
“If ‘our’ blood is going to flow,
let it flow all over the city.” You
didn’t mean the cops, you were
saying if they’re going to beat us
up then everyone should see it.
KUNSTLER
(quietly)
Jesus Christ.
ABBIE
You do this-(to KUNSTLER)
He does this, it’s a pattern. Read
his portion of the Port Huron
Statement. He implies possessive
pronouns and he uses vague noun
modifiers.
TOM looks at ABBIE...
TOM
(pause)
You read the Port Huron Statement?
ABBIE
I’ve read everything you’ve
published.
TOM
I didn’t know that.
ABBIE
You’re a talented guy. Except for
the possessive pronouns and the
vague-I know.

TOM

And for the first time, TOM is able to allow himself a
laugh...then--

152.
TOM (CONT'D)
(to KUNSTLER)
Put Abbie on the stand instead.
JUDGE HOFFMAN (V.O.)
Would you state your full name for
the record please.

ABBIE’s on the stand.
ABBIE
It’s Abbie.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Your last name.
ABBIE
My grandfather’s name was
Shaboysnakoff but he was a Russian
Jew protesting anti-semitism so he
was assigned a name that would
sound like yours.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
What is your date of birth?
ABBIE
Psychologically, 1960.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
What were you doing until 1960?
ABBIE
Nothing really. It’s called an
American education.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
Why don’t we just proceed with the
testimony.
Sure.

ABBIE

KUNSTLER
Do you know why you’re on trial
here?
ABBIE
We carried certain ideas across
state lines. Not machine guns or
drugs or little girls.
(MORE)

153.
ABBIE (CONT'D)
When we crossed from New York to
New Jersey to Pennsylvania to Ohio
to Illinois, we had certain ideas.
And for that, we were gassed,
beaten, arrested and put on trial.
In 1861, Lincoln said in his
Inaugural address that, “When the
people shall grow weary of their
Constitutional right to amend their
government, they shall exert their
revolutionary right to dismember
and overthrow that government.” And
if Lincoln had given that speech in
Lincoln Park last summer he’d be on
trial with the rest of us.
KUNSTLER
How do you overthrow and dismember
a government peacefully?
ABBIE
In this country we do it every four
years.
KUNSTLER
That’s all.
KUNSTLER sits.
SCHULTZ smiles a little...
SCHULTZ
So Chicago was just a massive voter
registration drive.
ABBIE
(laughs)
Yeah.
SCHULTZ
Did you hear the tape that was
played in court of Mr. Hayden at
the bandshell?
Yes.

ABBIE

SCHULTZ
You heard the tape?
Yes.

ABBIE

154.
SCHULTZ
Did you hear Mr. Hayden give an
instruction to his people to take
to the streets?
ABBIE
His people. Hayden’s not a mafia
Don and neither am I.
SCHULTZ
Did you hear him say, “If blood is
gonna flow, let it flow all over
the city”?
ABBIE
The beginning of the sentence was
supposed to be-(beat--forget it)
Yes. Yes I did.
SCHULTZ
What do you think of that?
ABBIE
I think Tom Hayden’s a badass of an
American patriot.
SCHULTZ
I didn’t ask what you thought of
the man, I asked what you thought
of his instruction to the crowd.
ABBIE
You know, I’ve heard Tom Hayden
say, “Let’s end the war” too but
nobody stopped shooting. You can do
anything to anything by taking it
out of context, Mr. Schultz.
SCHULTZ
Is that right?
ABBIE
A guy once said, “I am come to set
a man at variance with his father.
And the daughter against her
mother.” You know who said it?
SCHULTZ
Jerry Rubin?
ABBIE
(laughing a little)
Yeah. No. It was Jesus Christ.
(MORE)

155.
ABBIE (CONT'D)
Matthew 10:34. And it sure sounds
like he’s telling kids to kill
their parents. Until you read
Matthew 10:33 and 10:35.
Did you--

SCHULTZ

ABBIE
He’d just seen his best friend get
hit in the face with a nightstick.
The police, Mr. Schultz, whose
people are they?
SCHULTZ
Do you have contempt for your
government?
ABBIE
(laughing)
Do I-SCHULTZ
Do you have contempt for your
government?
ABBIE
I think the institutions of our
democracy are wonderful things
that, right now, are populated by
some terrible people.
SCHULTZ
Please answer the question.
ABBIE
Tell me again?
SCHULTZ
Do you have contempt for your
government?
ABBIE
I’ll tell you, Mr. Schultz, it’s
nothing compared to the contempt my
government has for me.
SCHULTZ
We’ve heard from 27 witnesses
who’ve testified under oath that
you hoped for a confrontation with
the police.
(MORE)

156.
SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
That your plans for the convention
were specifically designed to draw
the police into a confrontation.
ABBIE
If I’d known it was going to be the
first wish of mine that came true I
would’ve aimed higher.
SCHULTZ
It’s a yes or no question. When you
came to Chicago were you hoping for
a confrontation with the police?
ABBIE says nothing for a moment...
SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
I’m concerned that you have to
think about it.
ABBIE
Gimme me a moment, would you
friend? I’ve never been on trial
for my thoughts before.
FADE TO BLACK
TITLE:
Trial Day 113
208

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

208

We see some familiar faces in the gallery. DAVE’S FAMILY,
HOWARD, DAPHNE, BERNADINE...and we now see that FROINES and
WEINER are in the front row of the gallery too, no longer
with the defendants.
We HEAR a heavy door open on the side and the gallery hushes,
their eyes fixed on the side door.
The DEFENDANTS are led in wearing prison coveralls. They
exchange looks with FROINES and WEINER as they’re led to the
defense table.
All rise.

BAILIFF

JUDGE HOFFMAN enters and takes his seat without fanfare.
BAILIFF (CONT'D)
69 CR 180, United States of America
versus David Dellinger et al.

157.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
The law requires that before
sentencing I allow the defendant or
defendants to make a statement to
the Court. I’ve advised defense
counsel that the Court will allow
one defendant to speak for the
group and I’ve been advised that
the group has chosen Mr. Hayden. Is
that right?
TOM
(standing)
Yes sir.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
In spite of your actions during the
convention, you are the one
defendant who has shown during this
trial, respect for this court and
for this country and remorse for
your actions. I truly believe--I
mean this--I truly believe that one
day you could be a very productive
part of our system. I’d like you to
make your statement brief and
without any political content of
any kind. If you make your
statement brief, if you make it
respectful, remorseful and to the
point, I will look favorably upon
that when administering my
sentence. Do you understand what I
just said?
TOM sees a thick sheaf of papers that sits in front of Rennie
at the table.
JUDGE HOFFMAN (CONT'D)
Mr. Hayden?
Yes.

TOM

(pause)
You’ll look favorably in
sentencing.
Yes.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

TOM
(pause)
If I make my statement respectful
and remorseful.

158.

Yes.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

TOM
And I’m sorry, Your Honor, what was
the third one?
Brief.

JUDGE HOFFMAN

TOM
Brief. If I do those things...then
my government will look favorably
on me.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
You understand?
TOM looks back at the packed GALLERY--Dave’s wife and son,
Fred’s girlfriend, CLAIRE...
Yes sir.

TOM

JUDGE HOFFMAN
Please begin.
Okay.

TOM

TOM takes the thick sheaf of papers from in front of Rennie-TOM (CONT'D)
Your Honor, since the day this
trial began, four-thousand seven
hundred and fifty-two U.S. troops
have been killed in Vietnam.
(pause)
And the following are their names.
ABBIE leads the other DEFENDANTS in CHEERING as the GALLERY
ERUPTS and stands for this final moment of defiance. RENNIE
makes a small fist-pump to himself before standing and
CHEERING.
TOM (CONT'D)
Corporal Kenneth Joe Auston, 19
years old. Specialist Billy Francis
Dodd, 21 years old.
JUDGE HOFFMAN is banging his gavel, trying to restore order
as the NAMES and the CHEERING continue.

159.
JUDGE HOFFMAN
There will be--Mr. Kunstler, he
will not read four-thousand fivehundred names into the record.
There will be quiet in the gallery!
Mr. Hayden!
TOM
Staff Sergeant David Cruz Chavez,
31 years old. Corporal Philip
Lawrence Jewell, 21 years old.
Amidst the CHEERING and CLAPPING and GAVEL BANGING, SCHULTZ
rises to his feet.
FORAN
What are you doing?
SCHULTZ
Respect for the fallen.
(beat)
Show ‘em some respect, sir.
JUDGE HOFFMAN is banging his gavel in vain.
And while the NAMES and the CHEERING continue, the picture
starts to slowly freeze into a tableau...
