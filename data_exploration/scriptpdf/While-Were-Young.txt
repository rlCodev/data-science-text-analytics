SOLNESS:
The funny thing is that I've become so disturbed by younger
people!
What?

HILDE:
Younger people?

SOLNESS:
Yes, they upset me so much that I've sort of closed my doors here
and locked myself in. Because I'm afraid they're going to come
here, and they're going to knock on the door, and then they're
going to break in.
HILDE:
Well, I think maybe you should open the door and let them in.
SOLNESS:
Open the door?
HILDE:
Yes - so that they can just gently and quietly come inside, and it
can be something good for you. . .
SOLNESS:
Open the door?

Ibsen's "The Master Builder"

INT. FLETCHER/MARINA APT. - LIVING ROOM, BROOKLYN. DAY

1

CLOSE on Cornelia Srebnick, 41. She’s humming softly. We
MOVE out slowly to see she’s rocking the infant on a big
comfortable couch fionlled with baby blankets, stuffed
animals and children’s books.
We MOVE over to see Josh Srebnick, 44, on the floor watching
her -- his expression a kind of awe. She looks at him,
hesitating, taken by the intensity of his look. A moment of
connection and warmth passes through her.
He smiles softly back.
CORNELIA
(to the baby)
There were three little pigs and they
made a house out of twigs and the
wolf came and...
(to Josh)
Do you remember how it goes?
JOSH
He blows it down?
The baby starts to fuss.
CORNELIA
Yeah. But, what happens in the
middle?
JOSH
(thinks)
I keep wanting to do this little
piggie went to market but that’s with
the toes.
The baby starts to cry.
CORNELIA
The wolf keeps blowing the house in.
The pigs keep making different
houses.

Oh...shh, shh, shh.
The baby is wailing.

CORNELIA
What the fuck do we do?
Josh doesn’t know. Bang, a door opens and a woman comes in
with a boppy strapped around her waist. This is Marina,
30’s.
MARINA
Okay, who’s ready to eat?
JOSH
Are we taking in or --

MARINA
Who’s ready to eat?

She sits down on the couch next to Cornelia, lifts the
sobbing infant from out of Cornelia’s arms and places it on
the boppy. The baby’s onesie has an image from The Clash’s
first album across the chest. Marina opens her bra and gives
the baby her breast. The baby nurses, stretches and stops
crying.
MARINA
Ha! I love how she stretches...it’s
just like we do... It’s so funny.
It never occurred to me that
stretching is innate.
She stretches, imitating the baby. Cornelia smiles politely.
A curly haired man with glasses, early 40’s, enters. Fletcher.
FLETCHER
You want to see it?
Yeah.

JOSH
Fletcher sits near Josh.
FLETCHER
It got infected with staph but it’s
not the bad staph.
He pushes up his sleeve to reveal a square black and white
tattoo on his bicep.
CORNELIA
What is it?
FLETCHER
Guess.
(to Josh)
You can come closer it’s not the bad
staph.

FLETCHER
It’s Willow’s sonogram.
Oh...okay.

I did it for Marina. I was so
fucking proud of her.
MARINA
Why it’s for me, I still don’t
understand.

JOSH
Where do you even go for a tattoo?
FLETCHER
I asked a guy at work and he told me
where his kids went. Place in
Williamsburg. Where else?
(pause)
You know, she didn’t get the
epidurol.
MARINA
It’s a mother fucker -- it’s a ring
of fucking fire -- but it was the
most beautiful experience of my life.
FLETCHER
And I fell in love immediately. A
love I’ve never felt. I mean, don’t
take that the wrong way, Marina -MARINA
No, I know exactly what you mean.
It’s pure.

FLETCHER (O.S.)
When I saw her, I thought: “I know
you.”

MARINA (O.S.)
It’s true, I recognized her
immediately.
FLETCHER (O.S.)
And because I’d been reading to her
in the womb, she knew my voice
immediately.
MARINA (O.S.)
It’s like in one moment,
everything is different.

FLETCHER (O.S.)
I read her Stephen King’s The
Tommyknockers.

4A.

They enter. An open floor-through of a brownstone. The
room, separated by large wooden pocket doors, looks halffinished, framed pictures lean against the wall, projects
undertaken and abandoned. Some nice stuff, a couple of
antique chairs or a table. A water stain untended to on the
ceiling.

CORNELIA
I can’t remember Goldilocks either
anymore. The porridge part, but not
what happens.
JOSH
She gets eaten, right?
Does she?

CORNELIA
JOSH
There’s like an oven that’s too hot.
Josh shrugs.

Silence.

CORNELIA
You don’t want kids, right?
(Josh hesitates)
Because I don’t.
(they both hesitate)
I’m sorry, I feel so guilty for
saying that. I mean, I did. If we’d
had the magic sexy version and one
day suddenly had a baby... But all
those drugs and shots and
miscarriages -- I don’t want to do it
again and it not to work.
JOSH
I know.
(beat)
And I like our life as it is.
CORNELIA
(relieved)
Me too.
JOSH
I don’t want things to be different
than they are right now.
CORNELIA
I know. I mean, if we wanted to take
off for Paris tomorrow, we could.
JOSH
Yeah, I mean I think it would be hard
to find an affordable fare on such
short notice, but yeah...
CORNELIA
No, I know and I couldn’t leave work.

6.
JOSH
If we were going to do it we should
plan it at least a month in advance.
CORNELIA
A month is still in the realm of
spontaneity.
JOSH
No, I know. I mean, the time we
spent in Rome, what was that -2006.

CORNELIA
JOSH
(can’t believe it)
It wasn’t 2006.
CORNELIA
Yeah because I was working with my
dad on his dance film.
JOSH
Rome was eight years ago already?
Shit.
CORNELIA
Yeah, I looked at the pictures
recently and we’re two younger people
standing at the Treve Fountain.
JOSH
We look similar.
CORNELIA
We look younger.
(pause)
I tried to get you to go to Mexico
last summer -JOSH
I needed to finish my documentary.
CORNELIA
But you didn’t finish it!
They both take a deep breath.

Pause.

JOSH
Well, maybe the point is we have the
freedom. What we do with it isn’t
that important.

Josh, in his boxers, takes off his watch and puts it on the
night table. Cornelia undresses.
They move about in silence, finishing their nighttime
routines. Only the sounds of footsteps, water running,
clothes coming off and going on, bed squeaks.
Josh lies on his back and shuts his eyes.
Cornelia gets in bed and clicks on her bedside lamp which
lights up nearly everything. Josh places his arm over his
eyes.
JOSH
What is that, a seventy-five watt?
She looks under the shade.
CORNELIA
I can’t see, it’s too bright.
JOSH
It’s too high a wattage.
CORNELIA
I’ll change it tomorrow.

INT. JOSH/CORNELIA APT. - HOME OFFICE. DAY
Josh paces back and forth in his home-office. His editor,
Tim, early 30’s, sits at a desk-top attached to a series of
drives. A tousled scholar, Ira Mandelstam, 50’s, talks
gravely on a TV screen.

SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
There was a poll conducted in 1987 in
which people were given a series of
phrases and asked which ones could be
found in the US Constitution -JOSH
Let me see the continuity...
SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
One of the phrases that got the
highest percentage of votes was:
“From each according to his ability,
to each according to his need.”
This, of course, is not to be found
in the Constitution, but is the
famous Communist credo popularized by
Karl Marx.
Josh takes the sheet and holds it about two feet from his
face. He squints.
JOSH
Why do they type this stuff so small?
TIM
I think that’s 12 point.
normal.
SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
However, when this phrase was
presented to people as a
tenet of Communism, they, of
course, overwhelmingly
rejected it.

That’s

JOSH
That is not 12, that’s at
most eight. Look at it, it’s
tiny.

TIM
We need to cut away from Ira here
because...
We hear a ringing. On the SCREEN: the scholar goes into his
pants pocket and retrieves a cell phone from a few years ago.
Hold on...

SCHOLAR (ON SCREEN)
He looks at it like he’s never seen anything like it before.
He puts on reading glasses and very deliberately presses
Talk.

JOSH
We could cut to me asking the
question about hermeneutics?
TIM
We could, but you look like this in
that footage -He shows an image of a younger Josh in a goatee and Jew-fro.
TIM
It’s from eight years ago. And the
previous shot of you asking any
relevant questions is this -He pulls up an image of Josh with short hair and his arm in a
sling.
JOSH

subway stairs at Grand Army Plaza.

icy that was?

Well...we’re getting there.
Tim looks at him, totally skeptical.
JOSH
When the rest of the grant money
comes in, we’ll reshoot me asking the
questions along with the trip to
Istanbul.
TIM
Hey, Josh, I hate to bring this up,
but I’m gonna need a little money
soon.
JOSH
No, I know, you’ve been patient. I’m
just waiting for the rest of this
last grant money.
But soon?

TIM
JOSH
Yeah, I’ll get you.
Goes into his wallet.

INT. NEW SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. LATE DAY

A room with about fifty chairs, about seven of them occupied
by people over 50. Josh stands at a lectern with a lap top.
A blank TV screen behind him.
JOSH
“Le documentaire, c'est ce qui arrive
aux autres, la fiction, c'est ce qui
m'arrive à moi.” “Documentary is
about someone else. Fiction is about
me.”
(glances out at the small
crowd, having made it
through the French part)
This is a quote from Jean-Luc Godard.
Now, what do we think about this?
Can a documentary be personal?
Documentaries, I want to say to you
today, can and should be about me.
Josh hesitates. A guy in the audience wearing a porkpie hat
is filming him with a portable camera. Josh is momentarily
distracted.

your film, Power Elite.
JOSH

You’ve seen it? Hey...thanks.
JAMIE
It’s everything I aspire to and you
make it look so easy.
JOSH
Do you make documentaries?

JAMIE
I shoot stuff, you know, with
friends, yeah. Nothing like you’re
doing.
DARBY
He’s always shooting.
JOSH
Um, don’t take this the wrong way,
but how did you see Power Elite?
JAMIE
I found a VHS on Ebay. I paid like
sixty dollars for it. You know what
was great, was that scene with the
dogs around the garbage? How did you
stage that?
JOSH
Oh...those dogs were just there and I
said, “Hey shoot those dogs.”
(not a great story)
And...we did.
JAMIE

Beautiful.
JOSH
I’ve been working on this other one
for...about eight years now but I
think I’m zeroing in on it.
JAMIE
I’d love to see it.
DARBY
When I was a child my dog was killed
in front of me by two rottweilers.
(she starts to laugh)
I don’t know why I’m laughing. It’s
not funny. I was five. My dad and I
were walking our poodle which I had
named Toto and these two rottweilers
came bounding out of an open gate and
just attacked. My dad flagged down a
passing car and we climbed in the
back and he covered my eyes so I
couldn’t see Toto get mauled.
She covers her face, she’s still laughing.

you can discover more by not knowing
the answers, by allowing yourself to
be surprised by what you encounter.
Jamie nods with great interest.
JAMIE
Yeah, yeah.
JOSH
Sometimes that means waiting years
for something to happen. I don’t
know. I could go on about this stuff

CORNELIA
No, Josh likes to work alone.
JAMIE
(again with real interest,
to Josh)
Josh, what’s your new film about?
JOSH
Well, I’m trying to solve the problem
that Eisenstein never solved -- that
is how to make a film that is both
materialist and intellectual at the
same time -Darby gets a text and starts to reply. Jamie yawns openly.
Josh feels he’s losing his audience but keeps going.
JOSH
It’s about the distinctly American
relationship between biography and
history, theory and method and how
that relates to power and class in our
country, particularly the political,
military and economic elite.
(sensing he’s lost them)
It’s really about America.

Jamie takes out a pad and pen and scribbles something down.
JAMIE
Eisenstein is astonishing. I just
saw Strike! I’m obsessed with Europe
in the 20’s, see. The interwar
period, ex-patriots, that sort of
thing.
DARBY
I keep trying to get Jamie to do
something with before and afters.
All humans love before and afters.
Any TV show with before and afters
will succeed.

Before you said that.

After you said that.

sensibilities veer towards 4th grade
teacher. I like bulletin boards.
We see the place now. It’s old, open, and has the feel of
being haphazardly curated: from the mouse trap stuck to the
molding to the flea market furniture to the VHS tapes of
random movies stacked against the wall. A framed NY Times
front page of the moon landing. A framed Polish poster of
the Bob Dylan doc “Don’t Look Back.” A photo of Darby going
down a slip and slide in her wedding dress.
Josh looks at a stack of records. Velvet Underground, Kinks,
John Coltrane, Suicide, Serge Gainsbourg, Thin Lizzy...
JOSH
This looks like my record collection.
Except mine are CD’s. It took me
years to discover this stuff.
Jamie smiles and puts a record on the turntable. A Notorious
B.I.G/Miley Cyrus mash-up. Josh admires a long wooden desk
with a computer and editing equipment.
JOSH
I need to buy a new desk.
JAMIE
You should come with me to the lumber
yard. We’ll make one.
JOSH
A whole desk?
JAMIE
It’s so much cheaper than buying one,
see. And more fun.

Darby places down a home-made container with a hipster cow on
it and four spoons. She and Jamie eat straight from the
container. Josh and Cornelia follow.
DARBY
It’s an avocado and almond milk
sorbet. Benny designed the container.
JAMIE
It tastes like that candy that they
sometimes make into pigs or little
fruits.
JOSH
Yeah, it’s... Shit.

I know that.

CORNELIA
I keep wanting to say baklava, but
that’s a Greek dessert.
JAMIE
Right... “The almond tasting pigs

Josh pulls out his phone.

But they’re married.

FLETCHER
Josh squints at his menu. He picks up a candle and holds it
close to the menu in order to read.
JOSH
You should see this guy’s record
collection. It’s Jay-Z, it’s Thin
Lizzy, it’s Mozart. Their taste is
democratic. It’s The Goonies and
Citizen Kane. They don’t distinguish
between high and low, it’s wonderful.
FLETCHER
When did The Goonies become a good

It’s like their apartment is full of
everything we once threw out but it
looks so good the way they have it.

Tipper, in a a home-made, totally unofficial t-shirt that
says I’ve Been To A Lot of Hard Rock Cafes, kicks her leg
high in the air. Guys in vintage plaid shorts and porkpie
hats and beards and bare feet try to kick higher. Most
everyone is filming everyone. Young women in swim suits toss
a beach ball.
Jamie, with an apron that says Kiss the Chef, finishes
kicking and sees Josh and Cornelia approaching. He brightens
and waves.
JAMIE
What’s the rumpus, Srebnicks?
Darby hands Cornelia a pinkish drink in a clear plastic cup.
DARBY
Have you tried this? Someone at
college figured out that if you put
Jolly Ranchers in vodka for twentyfour hours -- it’s awesome.

Some kind of date rape genius.

He realizes very quickly that he over-reacted, tries to be a
good sport and tosses the ball back with a forced laugh.
Ha!

JOSH
Back atcha!

JAMIE
It’s lame, yeah. That’s why I’m
doing this new thing with it: I’m
going to start a profile and wait for
people to contact me.
JOSH
Well, that part’s normal, that’s
Facebook.
Josh is doused with water from some splashing partiers. He
tries to continue unfettered. He wrings out his shirt sleeves.

The scholar is yanked back by the lavaliere mike pinned to

He shuffles to the bathroom and pees with the door open.

I guess he’s just doing that.
TIM
Yeah. Hey, Josh, how’s that grant

infantilized. You know?

Yeah. What do you mean, you know?

A circle of kneeling people all dressed in white. It’s

A tall thin guy, 30’s, with pale skin and long black hair
kneels at a make-shift shrine. This is the shaman. In front
of him is an altar decorated with crystals and laminated
cards of St. Francis, Gandhi, Merlin, King Tut.
Josh leans over to Cornelia:
JOSH
How did King Tut become magical all
of a sudden?
Jamie, in a white Puma track-suit, leans forward over a
couple of people on Josh’s other side.
JAMIE
It’s because they discovered his tomb
in the occult boom of the 20’s.
“Shhh!” from the group.
The shaman pops open what looks like a Coke bottle and pours
a brown sludgy liquid into a shot glass. He says a
benediction. People, in succession, crawl over to him, he
does a blessing of sorts on their forehead and hands them the
glass. They drink and return to their original spots.
We watch as Jamie, Darby, Cornelia and Josh drink the dark
sludge.
Jamie drinks without thought.
Darby does the quotes thing in the air before she drinks.
DARBY
This is our twenties!
CORNELIA
I’m forty-one.
Cornelia sips it. She looks up at the shaman who smiles
encouragingly. She downs it and hands it back to him
proudly.
Josh hesitates, looks back at the group. He shrugs and downs
it, a significant portion missing his mouth. He quickly
wipes at his chin and tries to get the spillage back into his
mouth. He licks his fingers and palm and the sides of the
glass then hands the glass back to the shaman, who looks
mildly irritated.
They’re back in their circle.

INT. SCHOLAR’S APARTMENT

Ira, the scholar, is talking about the power structure of the
United States. Jamie shoots him. Tipper holds a boom. She
wears a T-shirt that reads in generic lettering: A College I
Didn’t Go To. Cornelia stands close by. Josh sits in a
chair in the back, listening through headphones. His eyes
drift away from the scholar and turn inward. He looks almost
afraid.

Okay.

CORNELIA
JOSH

I can’t fucking believe his idiotic
Facebook idea paid off! It’s so
fucking stupid! And my thing is a

(pause)
Sorry, I feel bad saying that. But I
also hate the fact he’s calling his
band Cookie O’Puss.
CORNELIA
What’s wrong with that?
JOSH
It’s just some funny old kitschy
thing to him he saw on YouTube. But
that was my commercial. I actually
experienced it. You know?
CORNELIA
I don’t know from Cookie Puss.
JOSH
Really? It was for Carvel. Cookie
Puss was the original one but they
did an ice cream cake for Saint
Patrick’s Day and it was this
floating green Irish cake that said,
“My name is Cookie O’Puss.”

EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT. DAY
Jamie walks with Josh through stopped traffic toward the
Goldman Sachs building.
JAMIE
Remember, ask him questions. You’re
interviewing him. He’d be goddamn
lucky to invest in your film.
Okay.

JOSH
JAMIE
And talk about shit he understands,

A bike messenger swerves by them on the sidewalk.
JAMIE

Ride on the street, man!

missing a beat)
Psych him up. Talk about money.
Talk about war. Power. Race. Make
it relevant to him.

Josh sits on a couch, Dave in an armchair.

Dave drinks from

HEDGE FUND DAVE
You see Mad Men?
No.

JOSH
HEDGE FUND DAVE
(waves it off)
It’s really apple juice. Nah, it’s
whiskey. Nah, it’s not. It is.
He drinks.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
So, tell me more about your project.
JOSH
Well, maybe a good way to start is by
asking you a question.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
Hey, they were all raped when I got
there.
Josh stares at him blankly.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
(re: highball)
This is my second in twenty minutes.
Shoot.
JOSH
Do you know the percentage of African
American adult males currently in jail?
I don't.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
JOSH
Take a guess.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
(playing along but not
really thinking)
Like 60%?
JOSH
Jesus, no!
(pause)
It's over 9%. That's nearly 1 in 10
African American adult males, nearly
a million and half.

72.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
A million and a half is a lot.
JOSH
It's insane, but people don't realize
this. They think because we have a
black president...
HEDGE FUND DAVE
(as if he's helping Josh
out)
So this is about prison. Like a
black Shawshank. But real. A real,
black Shawshank.
JOSH
(thrown)
No, not...no.
(pause and then speaking
quickly)
There's a section, an Entr'acte
really, on the function of race in
the prison industrial complex...
(trying to get back on
track)
But the film is really about how
power in America works... Do you know
the historian, Ira Mandelstam?
Yeah.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
JOSH
(pleased)
Really?
No.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
JOSH
Well, we have over a hundred hours of
interviews with him. Now -HEDGE FUND DAVE
The movie’s a hundred hours?
JOSH
No, we’ll cut it. Now, this guy,
he’s not particularly charismatic,
he’s kind of anti-social, maybe
asbergers, but not interesting
asbergers. He’s kind of boring even.
But he’s a charismatic thinker.

73.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
How do you show what he thinks?
Cartoons?
JOSH
(what?!)
No, not cartoons.

He says it.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
But he’s boring.
JOSH
Well...yes, but like many boring
things, the longer you watch it, it
takes on a different dimension -Josh wipes the sweat that has now accumulated on his face.
Dave’s glance goes to his Blackberry. He types something
quickly.
Mmm hmm.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
So, what’s it about?

JOSH
It’s really a very simple idea. The
three sections correspond to the
three nodes of what Mills called the
power elite: the political, military
and economic. But, and this is key,
each part has to interconnect to show
how none of these three nodes
functions without the other.
Dave tries to surreptitiously glance at his Blackberry.
JOSH
It’s a linear film of course, but I
imagine it as a kind of hypertext.
To be clear, the film is really about
the working class and, I can’t speak
on behalf of the working class. I
can’t make their film, of course.
They have to be felt as the
impossible subject of the text.
Through an examination of the power
structure the voice of the working
class has to be revealed in the
margins through its very absence. If
that makes sense.
The phone rings.

Both Dave and Josh look at it.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
Hey, I’m suddenly so popular.

74.
JOSH
(barrels on)
But it’s not even really about the
power structure but about what it
means to make a film about it. It’s
about the very possibility of making
this film...It’s really about America.
Dave can’t help it.

He lunges for the phone.

The sound of KNOCKING.

INT. BREITBART’S APARTMENT - DOORWAY. DAY
Josh stands in the doorway, he wears his bike helmet and
holds his hat. Breitbart smiles.
BREITBART
I was just working on my speech for my
memorial. What’s on your mind, son?

Josh nervously unstraps his bike helmet and puts on his hat.
An awkward exchange as he has trouble holding both. He
exhales. Breitbart finally accommodates by taking the helmet.
JOSH
Would you watch what I have? I think
I’m at a point where I need a new set
of eyes.

Ten years with the same project will
do that to you.
Yeah.

Josh waits, impatiently.

BREITBART (O.S.)
Well, you have a lot of good material
there.
Uh huh.

JOSH
BREITBART (O.S.)
Lots to think about. I need to
process it.
Uh huh.

JOSH
Breitbart reappears in the kitchen doorway.
BREITBART
Do you need the stuff about Turkish
politics?
JOSH
Yes, because it connects to what he’s
saying about the shift in power in the
contemporary global economy. And, of
course, it relates back to the earlier
stuff on the Ottoman Empire.
BREITBART
Right, but it feels like a detour.
What about the lengthy history of the
Triangle Shirtwaste Factory Fire? Do
you need that?
JOSH
The interview with Tillie
Kupferschmidst’s great great niece?
That’s the emotional center of the
movie. That’s where things come
together. Without that scene...why
make the film at all?

76.
BREITBART
But it’s too long.
JOSH
It has to be long. The point is it
makes you uncomfortable.
BREITBART
(gently)
I wasn’t uncomfortable, I was bored.
The kettle goes off.
Josh follows him in.

Breitbart goes back into the kitchen.

JOSH
Well, maybe boredom is your defense
from the discomfort.
BREITBART
(growing impatient)
You just showed me a six and a half
hour movie that runs about seven
hours too long. I’m trying to help.
JOSH
I understand, I understand. I think I
need to shoot some more interviews -BREITBART
(quickly)
Don’t shoot anymore! You have enough.
JOSH
Yeah? I just don’t think you’re
getting it or maybe there’s something
about me or what you saw that’s
clouding your judgement.
BREITBART
I’m telling you what I really feel.
JOSH
I don’t believe it. I think you’re
being deliberately critical.
BREITBART
Josh, I’m trying to help you.
JOSH
Bullshit! Is it because Cornelia and
I didn’t have children?
BREITBART
Oh, come on, Josh.

77.
JOSH
We tried. There were miscarriages.
I had to give her a shot in her ass
every day for three months. It’s a
huge fucking needle.
BREITBART
I didn’t know you tried so hard. She
didn’t tell me. I thought you guys
didn’t want kids.
JOSH
We didn’t want to hope for something
we probably couldn’t have.
(collecting his things)
This was a mistake.
BREITBART
I’m sorry you feel that way.
Josh starts for door.
JOSH
I know you think I didn’t reach my
potential.
BREITBART
No, son, no I don’t think you did.
(beat)
Your first film was so wonderful and
entertaining. We recognized ourselves
in it. This is ungenerous, it’s like
you took your ball and went home.
JOSH
You know what? I’m sorry I didn’t
become you.
BREITBART
I don’t want you to be me, Josh.
JOSH
Yeah, right.
BREITBART
I’ll see you at Thanksgiving.

Josh enters -- he’s late. The space is packed -- mostly with
a sea of 20-something kids who lie on top of each other on
the floor watching Jamie’s movie. Tipper, dressed up in a
sort of Mary Jane outfit and horn-rimmed glasses, perched up
on a table, watching very seriously, her arms wrapped around
her long bent legs. Jamie stands in back, he looks nervous.
Darby a few feet away from him is texting. Cornelia waves
from a crowded corner. Josh smiles wearily.
Kent talks soberly on screen.
KENT (ON SCREEN)
In the report it says we followed
procedure. A flashlight, three
flares, and the hand signals...
A quick jerky zoom into Kent, missing his face and then
adjusting to find him. He does the hand signals, punctuating
them with:

A light sweat breaks out on Josh’s face. Darby is looking
straight at him. She gives him a sad smile. Josh looks back
at the screen.
CLOSE: Josh’s scholar, Ira, talking about the politics of
war.
CUT TO: The movie is over. The mostly 20-something crowd
laughs, drinks beers. Breitbart picks an Oreo from a bowl of
Oreos on a table. Josh pushes through the kids to find
Jamie.

about how he shot something and we

She walks away, pissed. Dave pulls Jamie onward.
We MOVE in on Josh. Color vanishes from his face as a
terrible sinking feeling enters his body.
Two hands wrap around his neck like choking.

CORNELIA
Why not? When you felt a part of it,
you loved it.

And you use your career as an excuse
not to do anything. We don’t make
decisions, we don’t go on vacations,
we don’t have kids.
JOSH
I want a kid.
CORNELIA
You want it now that it’s impossible.
JOSH
It’s not impossible.

No. It’s over. It’s done. I’m not

FLETCHER (O.S.)
Marina’s at a work dinner.
Fletcher enters with a couple of old looking sheets. Willow,
the baby, sleeps in a moby wrapped around Fletcher’s torso.
FLETCHER
They’re both top-sheets but...you

Thanks.

JOSH

92.
FLETCHER
You might wake up when I come through
here for Willow’s 2 AM feeding. And
then 5 AM. And then all the other
times she wakes up.
JOSH
That’s okay.
Fletcher pours them both whiskeys. Josh picks up a cardboard
sleeve from a Wilco CD off of a table. He smiles.
JOSH
(re: the baby)
How is she?
FLETCHER
(looks down at her)
Pretty good. Cool baby. To be
honest, though, it’s a little hard
for me to relate to an infant.
JOSH
It seems kind of cool though.
FLETCHER
It’s like the pregnancy is its own
thing. You get so used to it. After
a while I just felt, we did this, we
don’t actually need the baby.
JOSH
(nods)
I’m sorry if I’ve appeared crazy
or...I don’t know...
FLETCHER
I’m sorry we didn’t invite you to the
party.
JOSH
(shrugs)
I think I’ve been jealous of you guys
having a kid...
FLETCHER
You know, before you have a kid,
everyone tells you, “It’s the best
thing you’ll ever do.” As soon as
you bring that baby back from the
hospital, the same people say, “Don’t
worry, it gets better.” It’s like,
what the fuck was that all about
before?

93.
JOSH
Having Willow must have changed your
whole perspective on life.
FLETCHER
(pause)
Not as much as I hoped it would.
(lowering his voice)
I love my kid but I’m still the most
important person in my life.
Fletcher winces as he sits in a chair.
FLETCHER
Did I tell you I have a herniated
disk, C5 or some shit... I’m getting
an epidurol on Monday.
JOSH

I have arthritis in my knees.

Josh leans in. He squints. His POV: CLOSE on the home-made
ice cream container in Kent’s hand. The hipster cow.
JOSH
That’s Darby’s ice cream.
TIM
It looks like mint of some kind.
JOSH

It’s avocado.
Tim unfreezes the image.

We ZOOM in on Jamie.

ovarian cancer, I was pretty
promiscuous, but I couldn’t love
anyone, I had body issues -JOSH
Darby was there before we were.
Don’t you see, she brought Kent the

Thank you.

BREITBART
He looks at himself in the mirror and approves.
BREITBART
It’s been very strange looking back
over my career. How did I accomplish
all of that? If I’m honest with
myself: it sometimes took being a
selfish prick. Of course, you can’t
say that. In my speech I attribute
it to talent, work and luck. It’s
something I don’t think your husband
realizes. He still believes the
speeches.
CORNELIA
When I first started dating him, he
reminded me so much of you.
BREITBART
His problem is he wants what I have
but he’s not merciless enough to get
it.
CORNELIA
(simply and sadly)
You know I am disappointed in Josh.
On some level I feel like he failed.
But I don’t know if I actually feel
that because I feel that or I feel it
because he does. Either way it’s a
terrible thing to think about your
husband.
BREITBART
You know, Josh told me...

CORNELIA

that every decision is the right one

there are limited options and you
have to pick.

There’s no magic in being old. Some

KENT
I learned magic from a dude, Elvin,
over in Afghanistan. He was shredded
by a land mine.
JOSH
That’s terrible.
KENT
I’m more old fashioned in my
approach. I don’t lock myself in a
box or anything, it’s mostly cards
and balls. I learn from YouTube

JOSH
Yeah...we need distractions. For me
it’s the internet. I’m trying to go
on less, you know. You know, it’s

Huffington Post?

Darby’s been a good friend for years.
We’d Skype sometimes when I was in
Kandahar. The reception was really
shitty though. It would freeze up
all the time.
JOSH
Did she know about...that you were in
the hospital?
Kent hesitates.
KENT
Who are you again?
JOSH
I’m Jamie’s cameraman.
KENT
And why are you asking this stuff?
JOSH
Fact checking the movie?
KENT
Uh huh. Yeah, Darby knew. Darby was
the first person I called. She came
to visit a few times before you guys
arrived.
Some kids knock Kent’s top hat off and run with it across the
garden.
KENT
Bring that back, you fuckers!

Sorry.

What did you think when Jamie talked
about Darby’s childhood as if it was
his own?

He said he was playing a part.

He said that when?

He called me a week or so before you

Dad’s thing, he’d like it and I’d
like it and...I’m so sorry for all
the things we said and I said and...I
haven’t said and...I’ve said but
haven’t said to you. This sounds
cryptic, and maybe insane, but it’s
not. I just, can you call me back?
Can you come, please?

Where are you, Josh?
The doorbell rings.

She brightens.

CORNELIA
Wait! Maybe this is you!
She hangs up and hurries to the door.

Darby opens the door. A duffle bag and suitcase, computer
and cat carrier with mewing cats are at her feet. Josh
enters. He’s sweaty and dirty and angry and out of breath
from the trip.
JOSH
I’ve got to talk to Jamie!
DARBY
He’s not here.
JOSH
Are you going somewhere?
DARBY

Tampa. If I stay here any longer
I’ll girl interrupt.
JOSH
I was just with Kent.

Oh...Kent...I love Kent...
JOSH
I saw your ice cream in Jamie’s
video.
Darby nods.

She smiles sadly.

DARBY
Well played, sir.

He let me think I was the one who
found out about Kent in Afghanistan.
Why?
DARBY
Jamie doesn’t want to disappoint you.
None of us want to disappoint you.

DARBY (CONT'D)
You’re such a purist. Jamie would
never have made the movie without
Afghanistan. When I told him about
Kent and the massacre he thought it
would make a good movie. He just had
to figure out how to tell it.
JOSH
But why not tell it honestly?
DARBY
It’s more entertaining this way.
(beat)
And now it has a before and after
which, as you know, Americans love.
JOSH
Of course he had body issues, they
were yours.
(off her look)
I don’t mean, of course you had body
issues, but...
(pause)
People have to know. He can’t get
away with this.
DARBY
Jamie does whatever he wants.
JOSH
This goes against everything he said
he admired in me. The whole
principle of making a doc. Darby,
you don’t understand. This is fraud.
It’s a big deal. People are jailed
for this kind of thing.
DARBY
I don’t like to meddle with people.
If they’re going to change, they’ll
change.
JOSH
Where is he?
DARBY
He’s at your father-in-law’s tribute.

Oh, shit! That’s now! And I

Josh pulls out his video camera and gestures with it.
JOSH
Jamie knew that Kent tried to kill
himself. That he’d been in
Afghanistan. We didn’t just stumble
upon it. It was rigged. Jamie
invented the whole Facebook thing
because he knew it would play better.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
Kent wasn’t in Afghanistan?
JOSH
No, Kent was in Afghanistan.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
So, what’s the problem?
JOSH
It’s...it’s...the way, the way he
said that he found him is not true.
HEDGE FUND DAVE
Kent served our country, you’re being
offensive.
Breitbart looks at Jamie.
BREITBART
Is what Josh is saying true?
JAMIE
Well...I did know, but I don’t think
it really matters though, the movie’s
not about that.
JOSH
Of course it matters.

Leslie,

BREITBART
I don’t know that it matters totally
in this case.
JOSH

What?
Dave leans in from the next table.

HEDGE FUND DAVE
I don’t care.
JOSH
(dismissive)
I didn’t expect you to care.
(quickly back to Leslie)
Leslie, are you kidding me? You
don’t care? You just gave a speech
about authenticity!
HEDGE FUND DAVE
(thinks about it again)
Yeah, I don’t care.
BREITBART
I just think the movie works on many
levels, the happenstance of it, to be
honest, I find the least interesting
part.
Josh sputters, practically stomps his foot.
JOSH
I can’t believe it! This movie isn’t
worth the...RAM...it’s...stored on.
(pointing at Jamie)
He’s a con artist. Leslie, your
generation of sit-ins and protesters
and...pack rats would be horrified by
this...demon!
BREITBART
You’re hysterical, Josh.
JOSH
(hysterically)
I’m not hysterical!
He swings his arm, gesturing, knocking a tray full of food
and glasses out of a waiter’s arms. It goes crashing to the
ground.
JOSH
Shit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
He helps the waiter pick up the plates. Everyone at the
table waits. Josh finally gets back up.
JOSH
Cornelia...

CORNELIA
I don’t know. I think he’s an
asshole, but the movie’s pretty good.
And I’m sorry I think that.
Jamie takes a seat and starts eating the dessert that was
placed in front of him.
JOSH
This is so frustrating! I’m going to
get no satisfaction here, am I? This
guy’s just going to win no matter
what.
Everyone at the table stares at Josh.

JOSH
This is not how the world works.
We MOVE in on Josh.

His face fills with emotion.

BREITBART
Why does it have to be one thing or
another? Things change. Different
things matter now.
JOSH
Forget ethics then. What about me?!
You played me. I was played.
JAMIE
(under his breath)
But you acted in it.
JOSH
Only because I thought it was real!
(pause, with genuine
feeling)
I loved you.
JAMIE
I like you too! We’re friends.
JOSH
(sadly)
I really believed it.
(his throat full of
sadness)
I was a bet!
BREITBART
Are you okay, son?

Josh wipes his face.
JOSH
I’m not crying.

I’m not.

Josh’s attention goes to a tiny camera in Jamie’s lap aimed
right at him.
JOSH
Are you filming this?!
BREITBART
Josh, your sleeve is on fire.
Josh’s sweatshirt has dipped into the flame of a candle on
the table and is indeed on fire. Jamie stands, grabs a
pitcher of water and douses Josh.
Josh drips, soaked. He shakes his head like a wet dog and,
dejected, moves to leave. He hesitates and turns to Breitbart:
JOSH
I took your note by the way. I cut
the stuff on Turkish politics out of
my film. You were right, I don’t
need it.
BREITBART
I’m glad to hear that, son.

Josh puts the video camera back in his tote. He sits on the
steps with his roller blades and whiskey bottle. Cornelia
arrives. She holds a plate with a napkin covering it. She
hands it to Josh.
CORNELIA
It doesn’t matter that it’s faked.
(Josh nods)
It doesn’t matter because it’s not
about Afghanistan and it’s not about
Kent it’s about Jamie.
JOSH
(sighs)
In my head, when I was blading over,
I swept in here and exposed
everything. I was such a hero.

He lifts the napkin on the plate to see a piece of chocolate
cake drizzled with chocolate sauce and a fork.
Thanks.

JOSH
Cornelia takes a swig from the bottle.
CORNELIA
When we first started seeing each
other I was so jealous. I would get
so upset when you’d talk to another
girl at a party.
JOSH
I know! I liked that...
CORNELIA
I was so sure you’d fall in love with
someone else and leave me.
JOSH
Did you want me to?
CORNELIA
I think I wanted to know that I
wasn’t your only option. But you
didn’t fall in love with someone
else. Until you did. And then it
was two people.
(beat)
I’m so sorry I kissed him. I really
did think it was you at first...then
I kind of kissed him again. I don’t
know why I did it. I wanted to like
him as much as you did.
Josh starts to eat the cake.
JOSH
(mouth full)
I wanted so badly...I wanted to be
admired. I wanted a protege.
I know.

CORNELIA
JOSH
He looked at me like I was a real
grown-up person. Someone who has
done things. For the first time in
my life I stopped thinking of myself
as a child imitating an adult.

Blue (09/16/2013)
CORNELIA
You feel that way too?
JOSH
(nods)
I’m forty-four and there are things I
will never do. Things I won’t have.
(pause)
What’s the opposite of “the world’s
your oyster?”
Cornelia’s eyes water.

She nods.

CORNELIA
I think I stopped taking you in.
JOSH
Am I a failure?
CORNELIA
You’ve never failed me.
JOSH
But am I a failure?
CORNELIA
I feel like I failed you. I wish we
could go back and meet each other all
over again.
JOSH
I’d present myself differently. So I
didn’t get your hopes up. Maybe not
use the expression “conquer the
world” so often.
CORNELIA
You said that a lot.
JOSH
I think it’s hard for me to have
something be great every day and to
acknowledge it.
(smiles at her)
I have something great every day. If
we were different people, I’d ask you
to renew our vows.
CORNELIA
I think it’s nice to renew vows.
JOSH
Maybe we are different people.
