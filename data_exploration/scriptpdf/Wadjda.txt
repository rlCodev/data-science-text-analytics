WADJDA

Written by

Haifaa Al Mansour

BLACK SCREEN.
Sounds of a busy schoolroom: shoes shuffling across the
floor, girls shouting, laughing and gossiping to each other.
GUNSHOTS and the WHINNY of horses blare out. The girls fall
quiet before they start singing in unison.
GIRLS (V.O.)
It's time for Jihad; it's the only
choice. The war is boiling,
calling.
TEACHER (V.O.)
Girls! Stand still in your spots!
FADE IN:
1

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM (SAUDI ARABIA)- DAY

1

A group of 11 YEAR-OLD GIRLS stand in three rows on a homemade wooden stage. A banner reads, "The Secondary Fourth
School for Girls-Riyadh East." A TEACHER eyes them
skeptically.
TEACHER
Again, from the beginning.
She pushes "play" on a small tape recorder on the floor.
CHORUS OF GIRLS
It's time for Jihad; it's the only
choice. The war is boiling,
calling.
The front row has four girls, one of whom is WAJDA, (11),
cute face with big, smart eyes.
They all sing in tune except for her. She's looking away
singing absentmindedly, missing most of the words.
Wajda watches two older girls, FATIN and FATIMA, pass by.
Wajda waves to them as she sings.
She looks at the teacher, now scowling at her, tucks her
hands in her pocket and tries to follow the other girls. They
all look similar except for Wajda.
The SONG halts abruptly as the teacher hits "Stop" on the
tape recorder. The girls' voices trail off.

2.
TEACHER
Wajda! Step to the front, please.
Wajda makes her way out of the rows of girls. NOURA, (11), a
sweet and perfect type, bumps into her, smiles and fills her
place in the front line. Wajda stands in front of the line of
girls alone.
TEACHER (CONT’D)
Why don’t you show us all how well
you sing? Start with the first
verse.
Wajda becomes very nervous. Her face reddens and she stares
hard at the floor, she tries to sing, but her mouth clamps
tight.
TEACHER (CONT’D)
Well? If you don’t want to share
that “beautiful” voice of yours
with us...
The teacher gestures towards the tape recorder.
Wajda stares at the floor as she sits down next to the tape
recorder, scowling.
The line is much more unified now. The Teacher smiles with
satisfaction then glares at her.
Well?!

TEACHER (CONT’D)

Like a professional DJ, Wajda's hand rewinds the tape, stops
it and hits "Play" all in one motion.
THE CHORUS OF GIRLS
It's time for Jihad; it's the only
choice. The war is boiling,
calling. The horses are prepared;
the battle will start. War heals
wounds way better than suppressing
anger. If our religion is
humiliated, heaven calls and our
fate is written. Where are the
proud men to answer the calls?
Allhu Akbar is our song; It is our
light and the fire we fight with!
THE CHORUS CONTINUES THROUGH THE TITLES
STATIC BLENDS OVER THE SONG LIKE A RADIO TUNING TO ANOTHER
CHANNEL and then...

3.
A RAUCOUS ROCK SONG STARTS!
2

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

2

In her small, sparsely decorated room between a single bed
and a window covered completely with wallpaper, Wajda hits
"record" on her tape recorder as the ROCK SONG continues.
Dancing and moving to the beat, she insures that a cord from
the window is properly connected to the radio antennae.
She writes down the song on a track list labeled "Wajda's
Awesome Mix Tape, Vol. 7." Next, she counts out homemade
bracelets and puts them in small plastic bags. Finally, she
puts on her black converse high-tops with colored laces.
As she waits for the ROCK SONG to end, she looks through the
half open door to her MOTHER, busy drying her hair.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

3

WAJDA'S MOTHER (33), struggles with a broken hair-dryer as
she straightens her beautiful long hair. She is petite, with
a definite sparkle in her eye, but right now she’s
frustrated. The brush becomes too hot and she quickly dries
the rest of her hair without it.

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

Wajda takes some money from a drawer and puts it in her
pocket. She hits "Stop" on the tape recorder and runs out.
5

INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY

5

Wajda's Mother twists her hair and adds colored clips. She
moves to the kitchen and adds cups of cardamom and coffee to
boiling water in an old pot. Outside a car HONKS its horn.
In rapid motions, her Mother takes the over-boiling coffee,
puts it in a thermos and grabs her notebooks.
Wajda enters, drops her backpack and hurries behind, carrying
the rest of her Mother's supplies.
The Mother grabs keys from a hook by the entrance. A string
of blue prayer beads fall to the floor. She puts them back on
the hook, pulls her veil over her face and turns to Wajda.

4.
MOTHER
Don't forget your key, and don't
lock the upper lock. Your Father
may be coming later after his night
shift.

EXT. FRONT OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY

6

A Pakistani Driver, IQBAL, (late 20’s), squats in front of an
old van, sticking the broken headlights on with tape. He
turns as Wajda and her Mother emerge.
IQBAL
(In broken Arabic, bossy)
It very long way, Madame! Other
teachers we are taking, very long
way. You late every day! No taking
you late.
WAJDA
She's not late! You just came! I
saw you - five minutes not even!
IQBAL
I no talk to you little girl, I
talk to your Mother, she is late!
Iqbal enters the car and slams the door. A picture of a cute,
smiling child wearing traditional Indian dress with flowers
in her hair, falls to the car’s floor. Iqbal picks up the
picture and cleans it carefully then puts it back on the
car’s counter.
MOTHER
Don't worry about him. Okay, yalla
bye!
(to Iqbal) )
No problem, Iqbal. You take lots of
money; let's have some quiet for
the long drive.
She takes her things from Wajda and quickly enters the van.
The bus jolts away. Wajda is about to walk back into the
house when the minivan swerves to avoid an oncoming car,
almost crashing into it. She watches until it disappears,
worried for her Mother.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Wajda grabs her backpack, stopping by the mirror. She looks
at herself and touches her hair, then puts on her abbayah.

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

8

Concrete houses line the street. All the windows are covered
in aluminum. A typical middle class neighborhood in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia.
Groups of girls walk to school, completely covered in
abbayahs and veils, distinguishable only by their different
backpacks. Taxis and minivans pass by full of covered women
in black.
Wajda exits her gate and walks towards school. Suddenly a
rock flies by her feet and knocks a soda can from its place.
She looks up to see her FATHER (35), smiling and tossing
another rock up in the air, playfully.
Dark and handsome with short soft black hair and a well
groomed mustache, he wears a worn-out blue oil-man’s uniform.
FATHER
Watch this!
He flings the rock towards another can just past her on the
wall. She ducks but looks over to see the can fly from its
place. Wajda searches and picks up another rock.
WAJDA
Oh yeah, check this out!
Full of bravado, she flings the rock at a milk carton near
his feet but it falls short and BOUNCES off target.
FATHER
Ha! Keep practicing. You're getting
there!
WAJDA
Look who's back! Where have you
been?
She smiles, runs and gives him a big hug.
FATHER
Oof. Look at this.
He pulls out a shiny black rock from his pocket.
FATHER (CONT’D)
It's volcanic, from the Empty
Quarter. It has a great velocity.
It'll help your aim. Now get going.
She takes it, beaming. He taps her on her head and she runs
off to school.

6.
WAJDA
We left the door unlocked.
Mom's been waiting for you all
week!
The father’s eyes flicker at the mention of the mother. He
passes his hand over his untidy black hair feeling uneasy.

EXT. FRONT OF THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

9

ABDULLAH, (11), a skinny, bright-eyed boy, stands near the
entryway, setting up a billboard. He peeks inside at Wajda as
she enters and heads for the candy bars, picking out
chocolate. She sees him and smiles. Abdullah immediately
looks away.
He busies himself with the billboard, attaching a large
election poster of an overweight, mustached man on a chair
that looks like a throne. The poster reads: "Vote for me for
Municipal Council. Your glorious representation."
Abdullah's bicycle stands next to the board with his books
clamped onto a rack on the back.
Out of the corner of his eye he watches Wajda approach,
munching on a breakfast sandwich. He quickly brushes his hair
into place and acts busy and important.
WAJDA
(laughing)
Huh, what is this, an advertisement
for mustache products?!
Abdullah smiles, composes himself and faces her with an
annoyed look.
ABDULLAH
Smart-ass, it's a mustache so
strong a falcon could stand on it!
WAJDA
A falcon? An airplane could land on
that thing!
Abdullah smiles but then sees a group of boys approaching. He
quickly snatches the sandwich out of her hands and runs off.
ABDULLAH
Thanks for buying me breakfast!
WAJDA
Hey! If it's a race you're after
don't blame it on the sandwich!

7.
She breaks into a run after him. They race through the
streets, away from the boys, switching positions in the race.
She overtakes him, snatches the sandwich and looks back,
pumping her arms in the air, relishing the victory.
Away from the other boys, Abdullah now smiles at her. He then
runs back to the billboard.
10

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

10

Wajda walks on to school eating her sandwich happily. She
continues the target practice with her beloved new rock,
aiming at several objects as she goes.
Suddenly out of nowhere, Abdullah snatches her veil as he
zips past her on his bicycle. Wajda falls hard to the ground,
her sandwich now covered in dirt. Her hair is exposed. It’s
covered in curls and colored hair clips like her Mother's,
but sloppier. Abdullah points.
ABDULLAH
(laughing)
What is all this?
She puts her hands over her head, embarrassed.
WAJDA
(indignantly)
It's so in fashion now.
Abdullah continues laughing. She runs furiously after him. He
dangles the veil mockingly behind him as he rides ahead.
Pitying her, Abdullah finally slows down. Wajda reaches out
and rips the veil from his hands but falls hard to the
ground, into a puddle of mud.
Abdullah stops. Wajda angrily gets up and screams at him.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Stupid! How can I go to school like
this?
He’s about to get off his bicycle and help her when several
boys come out of a nearby store. Abdullah thinly disguises
his guilty look with a mocking smile.
ABDULLAH
Did you really think you could
catch me?

8.
WAJDA
(confused)
I did catch you! You and your
stupid bicycle.
ABDULLAH
Yeah right. Now you’re late and
covered in mud. If you had a
“stupid” bicycle you could go home
and change. But you don’t, so you
can’t.
Wajda, hurt, looks up as he slowly pedals away with the other
boys, all on bikes as well, talking and laughing. They ride
in circles, challenging each other and showing off.
Wajda clutches her soaking veil, watching them all ride away
together, happy and free.
WAJDA
(to herself)
I’ll get one and show you.
As she smooths out her veil, now too dirty to put back on,
she doesn’t see Abdullah glancing back with a pained, sorry
look.
11

EXT. INSIDE THE FRONT GATE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

11

Wajda tries to blend in with the other girls and sneak in.
MS. HUSSA, (35), the pretty but stoic principal, stands
inside the wall that protects the privacy of the school
entrance.
A loud LAUGH comes from the gate as Fatin and Fatima enter.
Ms. Hussa moves towards them.
MS. HUSSA
All right girls, you are just
behind the gate, don't laugh so
loudly. Women's voices shouldn't
carry outside the door!
Fatin smiles and nudges Fatima. They giggle but act polite.
FATIMA
Sorry, Ms. Hussa.
FATIN
It won’t happen again.
Wajda seizes the opportunity to try to sneak past but--

9.

Wajda!

MS. HUSSA

Caught! Wajda stops, turns to face her.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
(with malicious enjoyment)
Where is your head cover? Are you
coming to school unveiled?! And who
put those awful clips in your hair?
The girls all stop talking and giggle at her, except for
Fatin and Fatima who watch sympathetically.
Wajda looks down in frustration at her wet veil.
12

INT. SCHOOL INTERIOR COURTYARD - DAY

12

The midday sun burns directly above Wajda as she stands in
the corner of the schoolyard, punished.
13

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

13

Wajda's sneakers stand out from all the other girls in plain
black shoes, leaving school. Her eyes then catch colorful
majestic feet as a group of boys pedal by on their bicycles.
They kick up dust and laugh, gliding past. Wajda watches them
forlornly as they disappear around the corner.
Wajda continues walking, throwing the stone her Father gave
her at various targets. She misses a few times and then
finally hears a “Ping” as it hits its first mark: A SHINY
GREEN BICYCLE
Somehow perched above the other side of a fence.
She stares at it, intrigued, for several seconds, as it seems
to float on the other side of the fence. She picks up her
black stone and entranced, her eyes follow this vision.
Suddenly it begins to move across the top of the fence, until
it comes to the end, where Wajda sees that it’s resting on
the top of a moving truck. Her heart locks on it and without
even thinking, she runs after the bicycle as it disappears
down the next block.
14

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP - DAY
Wajda’s feet race, her eyes like steel and she finally
catches up to the truck now parked in front of a toy shop.

14

10.
Men unload boxes and bicycles wrapped in plastic bags. She
cranes her neck. Where is the green one?
As Wajda moves forward she hears a SPLASH! She looks down.
She’s standing in a stream of water. She moves to the side.
As the truck pulls away the TOY SHOP OWNER goes into the shop
and brings out THE BICYCLE. He puts it on display in the
front, out in the sun. He takes a sign from his clipboard,
writes, "Only 500 Riyals," and places it on the handlebars.
He goes back inside the store and puts an "Talal Maddah"
record on an old record player, glancing at this strange
little girl still standing outside his door.
Her eye then shift to the sign and the price as the MUSIC
drifts out of the store.
15

EXT. THE CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

15

Wajda counts the small wad of money she made at school today
and stuffs it back into her pocket in frustration. She takes
out the black stone from her pocket and throws it across the
field at a coke bottle. A group of WORKERS yell suggestive
insults at her.
INDIAN WORKER
Nice throw! Come up and play
with us! Let me touch those little
apples.
Wajda freezes and pretends she didn't hear him.
They laugh vulgarly at her. As she hurries towards the rock,
Abdullah appears and picks it up. He throws it far across the
lot, knocking another coke bottle out of its place.
Wajda relaxes, relieved to see him, but then acts upset as
she runs and picks up the stone. She picks up another one and
throws it back towards him.
WAJDA
Take this! And stop following
me. I don't want to play with you
any more. They made me stand up all
day at school in the sun for not
having a veil today.
The rock falls short of Abdullah's feet. He looks at Wajda,
ashamed. Wajda puts her stone in her pocket, glaring at him.
He picks up the rock and runs to his bicycle and pulls out a
package.

11.
ABDULLAH
Here, I got you this.
Wajda looks at him, walks over and takes the package. She
opens it and unfurls a new black veil with a yellow flower
made of beads on the corner. She acts defiant as she puts it
in her bag.
WAJDA
This doesn't make us even, you
know. We'll get even when we race.
I’ll have my new bicycle very soon.
ABDULLAH
What? Girls can't have bicycles!
WAJDA
Then I guess it will be that much
more embarrassing for you when I
beat you!
Wajda walks away in a huff. Abdullah looks at the stone she
threw at him and stuffs it in his pocket.
Abdullah rides away on his bicycle as a small pick-up truck
passes by causing a huge cloud of dust over Abdullah. Wajda
looks back and laughs.
The CONTRACTOR gets out of his car and heads towards the
workers.
He looks at Abdullah.
CONTRACTOR
Hey, you, go away little boy!
Abdullah is upset. The Contractor goes over to the workers.
CONTRACTOR (CONT’D)
All day and only one pillar? 5 men
working and I get only one pillar?
He slaps one of them on his neck.
CONTRACTOR (CONT’D)
Go to car go.. We have to finish
working on the other building.
He stuffs the workers onto the back of the truck. Some of the
workers put wet towels on their heads to avoid the unbearable
heat.

12.
16

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

16

Wajda’s sneakers kick up small clouds of dust as she heads
home. Green bushes have just been planted on the side of the
road. She leans over and smells them. She smiles and picks
the leaves off, one by one.
17

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

17

Wajda sits at her desk with her money out in front of her.
The green leaves are now sorted into small plastic bags to
the side. She writes "500 Riyals" on a piece of paper and
draws a chart underneath. She sorts the notes and counts
them.
WAJDA
10 riyals, 15 riyals, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 riyals.
She writes "25 Riyals" on the chart. Then Wajda sits on the
floor with her foot extended and wraps strings around her big
toe making woven bracelets. She checks a list of girls' names
and football teams.
She hears the DOOR opening and goes to meet her Mother.
18

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

18

Wajda's Mother's face is puffy and red. She falls down on the
couch exhausted, removes her veil and fans herself with it.
Her hair loks messy but full of ribbons and curls.
Wajda turns on the air conditioner, grinning. Her Mother
looks at her as she struggles to lift herself from the couch.
MOTHER (O.S.)
I don't like this look. What are
you up to?
WAJDA
(excited)
I'm going to buy a bicycle to
race Abdullah Al Hanofi!
MOTHER
Three hours in the car without AC!
I swear this commute is going to
kill me and you tell me bicycle?
She takes off her shoes and black socks, rubbing her feet.

13.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Absolutely forget about getting
a bicycle. Have you ever seen any
girl riding a bicycle? (pause)
I'd rather sell fruit down at the
hospital than go on this hideous
trip every day!
Wajda makes a face and stomps off to her room. Her Mother
goes to her bedroom and picks up a man's dirty blue uniform
from the floor.
19

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

19

Wajda hurries off through the gate of a house.
20

INT. LIVING ROOM OF WAJDA'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

20

She enters and finds her GRANDMOTHER, an overweight woman in
her 60’s, watching TV, the remote in her hand.
GRANDMOTHER
(surprised)
Wajda! What are you doing here so
early?
Wajda smiles. She goes up and kisses her forehead.
WAJDA
Good morning, Grandmother. Hope you
are doing well today. Look what I
got you!
Wajda gives her a plastic bag filled with green leaves. She
then opens her abbayah, exposing a navy-blue vest on top of
her gray uniform. She smiles wider.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
See, Grandmother, I'm wearing the
vest you made me.
GRANDMOTHER
(smiling but suspicious)
It's nice of you to think of me
this early in the morning!
She looks happily at the vest and smells the leaves. She
pulls her braided hair from her veil and replaces the
withering leaves with the fresh ones Wajda brought.

14.
WAJDA
(reluctantly)
Only 10 riyals! I brought some for
your friend Um Khalid too!
The Grandmother, twisting her lips in annoyance, slips her
feet into her shoes, sighs, lifts herself slowly out of her
chair and walks toward the next room.
GRANDMOTHER
Did your Mother send you?
She struggles to get herself down a small step. Wajda looks
at her sympathetically and helps her. Her Grandmother gently
pats Wadja's back.
WAJDA
No, Grandma! I'm trying to save
some money… to buy a nice abbayah.
GRANDMOTHER
I don't know what to do with you or
your Father. He’s always nagging
me, "Should I take a second wife? I
need a son." I tell him, "Go home
to your wife and daughter and leave
me alone," but he keeps coming here
with a list of families I have to
call for brides.
The Grandmother gets her wallet and gives Wajda 10 riyals.
GRANDMOTHER (CONT’D)
He can't even buy an abbayah for
his daughter. Where would he get a
dowry for a second wife?
WAJDA
Thanks, Grandma!
Wajda runs out, avoiding looking at her Grandmother.
21

EXT. INSIDE THE FRONT GATE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

21

Wajda walks past Ms. Hussa, tea-cup in hand, bored, watching
the crowd of girls flow through the gate.
Noura approaches Ms. Hussa coyly. She gathers up her courage
and holds out a single flower with a note attached.
NOURA
(sweetly)
This is for you.

15.
Wajda watches from the corner of her eye. Ms. Hussa looks
questionably at Noura, takes the flower and reads the note.
MS. HUSSA
Thank you for your feelings, but
you know you are not supposed to
bring flowers to school.
Noura reddens. Ms. Hussa gives her back the flower then heads
over to the gate, not noticing the note falling to the
ground.
Wajda rushes over, picks the note up, stealthily looks at it,
laughs, sticks it in her vest pocket and hurries inside.
22

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

22

Wajda enters. One girl cleans the blackboard while others
copy each other's homework.
ONE OF THE GIRLS
(to another girl)
Change the sentence a little, she
will know you copied it!
(noticing Wajda)
Here comes the salesgirl!
ANOTHER GIRL
Hey Wajda, did you finish the
bracelets?
WAJDA
Not all. I have only 10.
You have to pay 2 riyals extra.
It's a lot of work!
The girls gather as she hands out bracelets and collects
money.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Quickly, I have to go!
23

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

23

Wajda is playing on the hopscotch grid. Noura raises her head
and looks off into the distance.
NOURA
We need to go inside! Men are
watching us!

16.
All the girls look to where Noura is pointing. Wajda can
barely make out a group of construction workers atop a
building in the distance.
WAJDA
They're so far away; they can't see
us from there.
NOURA
If you can see them, they can see
you. Come on, all good girls are
going inside.
She smirks at Wajda as the girls all follow her in. Shamed,
Wajda thinks, then smiles and calls out.
WAJDA
Hey Noura!
(pulls out the note)
"I love you, Ms. Hussa. You are
like the moon, my dream, my eyes,
and my heart!" Ha Ha!
Noura looks furiously at Wajda who waves the note in the air,
making kissing noises. She puts the note into her vest pocket
and tosses a rock onto the hop-scotch grid. Noura storms
inside.
Wajda looks up to see Fatin and Fatima pass by looking at a
magazine while walking towards the back of the school.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Hey, you shouldn't be outside, men
can see you!
FATIN
(sarcastically)
Men are watching? What a scandal!
They'll tell everyone they saw
Wajda al Safan playing
provocatively in the schoolyard.
They can't miss you, especially in
that sexy vest of yours.
She and Fatima smile and head over to Wajda.
FATIN (CONT’D)
So, what's the latest mix?
WAJDA
(excited, like a salesman)
It's got everything, "Bink, get the
barty start…"

17.
FATIMA
(laughing)
"Party."
WAJDA
Whatever, "party." 10 riyals.
FATIN
(laughing)
You little devil, I don't know
where you get this music from. I'll
get one later for sure. Hey, what
about bracelets? Look at this
gorgeous creature.
(holds up a picture of a
football player)
I want a bracelet of his team- Al
Hilal.
WAJDA
(inspecting the picture)
No problem, I'll make you a special
one for tomorrow, but 10 riyals.
FATIN
(patting her head)
Okay, tomorrow then, little
hustler.
WAJDA
(smiling, pulling her head
away)
Don't mess my hair! And hey, you're
not supposed to bring magazines to
school! Ms. Hussa will kill you.
FATIN
Look who's talking! Your bag is a
24 hour convenience store.
The three laugh and Wajda continues playing. Fatin and Fatima
sit just past the corner of the building. They pull out nail
polish from their pockets and start painting their toenails
blue, the magazine open next to them.
Wajda stops halfway through a leap on the hopscotch grid, her
left foot still elevated, as she sees Ms. Hussa approach.
The girls quickly rush inside, dropping the nail polish
bottle on the bench. Ms. Hussa turns to find Wajda alone,
staring at her.

18.
MS. HUSSA
What are you doing there?
Go to your class right now or
you'll be punished!
Wajda stares down at the ground and quickly follows Ms. Hussa
into the building. She sees the bottle of blue nail polish,
scoops it up and hurries off.
24

EXT. INSIDE THE FRONT GATE OF THE SCHOOL - LATER

24

Ms. Hussa stands in front of the gate, examining the girls as
they pass. She stops one girl with a "Titanic" backpack.
25

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY
Wajda’s about to leave when an older girl, ABER, pulls her
aside and whispers to her.
ABEER
Can you take this paper out to my
brother?
WAJDA
(suspiciously)
What is this?
ABEER
Shh! It’s a… permission slip to
pick me up from school.
Wajda glances over at Ms. Hussa, concerned.
ABEER (CONT’D)
(whispering, but adamant)
I'll give you 10 riyals!
Wajda looks back at Ms. Hussa, then at Abeer.
20.

WAJDA

Abeer sighs, gives her some money and the note.
ABEER
He's outside on the corner in a
pickup truck.
Wajda goes out cautiously, trying to act casual.

Ms. Hussa scolds the backpack girl, who anxiously watches the
bus fill up.
MS. HUSSA
…And change your bag, images are
forbidden!
BACKPACK GIRL
(running towards the bus)
Okay, okay, Inshallah. I've got to
catch the bus!
Ms. Hussa turns just as Wajda’s about to leave through the
gate.
Wajda!

MS. HUSSA

She tries to hide the paper in her bag and heads over.
Ms. Hussa pauses, looks at Wajda, then over to Abeer. Abeer
pulls her veil quickly over her face and turns away. Ms.
Hussa squints down at Wajda, studying her.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Come with an abbayah like this
tomorrow or we will reserve your
place in the sun for you. Here.
She hands Wajda a pamphlet with a picture of a black figure
on the front. Wajda takes it and hurries off.

EXT. FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

27

Wajda passes by the school bus, overflowing with girls, and
sees a handsome YOUNG MAN, (20’s), by a pickup truck,
waiting.
WAJDA
Are you Abeer's brother?
YOUNG MAN
(smiling)
Yeah sure, I'm her brother. Have
you got the paper?
WAJDA
(holding it out)
Yeah, she said you'd give me 20
riyals to deliver it.

20.
YOUNG MAN
(skeptically)
Really? Hmmm.
WAJDA
(haughtily)
You don't look like her brother!
YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Okay, okay here's 20.
Wajda takes the money and sniffs it, making a funny face.
WAJDA
Even your money reeks of perfume!
I'll have to wash it.
He tries to suppress a smile, dismisses her with a wave, and
gets in his car. He drives around in front of the gate.
GUARD (V.O.)
Abeer Rassi come to the gate. Your
ride is here to pick you up.
28

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP - DAY

28

Wajda sees the green bicycle glimmering in the afternoon sun
and stops in awe.
As The Owner comes out, Wajda licks her finger and rubs an
"X" on the bicycle, claiming it. Her face beams with
happiness.
WAJDA
(indicating her “X”)
Don't sell this one. I reserved it!
The Owner uses his sleeve to rub the bicycle clean where she
touched it.
He looks down at her with a glimmer in his eyes.
THE CALL FOR DHUHUR PRAYER interrupts the moment. He covers
his goods with a big black blanket. Wajda watches as the
blanket falls over her bicycle.

21.
29

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

29

Abdullah is amongst A CROWD OF MEN heading to pray at the
mosque by the toy shop along with HIS FATHER and mustached
UNCLE. As Wajda sees him she turns away and hides the
distinguishing yellow flower on her veil under her abbayah.
As she turns back Abdullah sees her in the crowd. They look
at each other. She gestures with her eyes to the handle of
the green bicycle showing underneath the blanket.
Abdullah rubs his fingers together to show that it will take
money to buy it. Wajda takes out twenty riyals from her
pocket and waves it defiantly at him. She turns her head
proudly and struts off.
30

INT. WAJDA'S PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT

30

Wajda’s on her Mother's bed, legs on the headboard, her
toenails now painted blue. Her Mother sits in front of the
mirror straightening her hair and singing beautifully.
MOTHER
I'll write you a love letter. Tell
you how much I miss you…
She takes another lock of hair and runs the iron over it.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I wish I could cut my hair shorter
like Lubna Abdul Aziz.
Do it.

WAJDA

MOTHER
Your Father loves my long hair.
(singing)
I'll write you a love letter. Tell
you how much I miss you…
She takes out a bandana to wrap her hair and sees a new tube
of lipstick in front of her.
The Mother looks at Wajda in the mirror with a touched smile.
Wajda sees her Mother smiling and turns away shyly. Her
Mother applies the lipstick.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I’d thank you for this but I'm
afraid to ask where you got the
money. Did you ask your Grandmother
for it?

22.
WAJDA
I sold her stuff! It's not charity!
MOTHER
I don't want you going over there!
Your Father finishes his shift
early tomorrow night. What should
we cook? Margoog?
WAJDA
I hate margoog. And is he going to
give me my allowance this month or
is he going to skip it again?
MOTHER
(ironing her hair)
Your Father loves margoog. We’ll
cook it for him.
WAJDA
Cook me kapsa! He’s paying the
second wife's dowry off with my
allowance!

Wajda's Mother stops ironing, her body language becomes stiff
and tense.
Wajda reddens, Her Mother remains silent, ties the bandana
into place, rises, and exits to the kitchen.
31

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

31

As Wajda she sees Ms. Hussa at the end of the hall, glaring
intensely at her.
32

INT. MS. HUSSA'S OFFICE - DAY

32

An avalanche of items comes pouring out of Wajda's backpack
onto the desk as Ms. Hussa shakes out its contents. Wajda
sits nervously in a chair. The rock her Father gave her
tumbles off the desk and onto the floor next to her.
Ms. Hussa shakes her head as she goes through the bracelets,
cassettes, schoolbooks, notebooks and candy bars. She picks
up one of the tapes and relaxes back into her chair.

23.
MS. HUSSA
(Authoritatively)
Tapes full of love songs,
bracelets, all of this… You know
are not allowed in school!
She opens a folder, signing papers as she talks.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Abeer was always a good girl. Do
you know how she ended up getting
picked up with a strange boy by the
religious police?
Wajda remains silent, trying not to fidget.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Thank God they found someone to
marry her off to, it's not like her
family will let her come back to
school after this.
Ms. Hussa stops signing, sits back in her chair and stares at
Wajda, who looks back at her nervously.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
So, did you arrange this whole
rendezvous for Abeer and her lover?
WAJDA
(defensively)
No, I didn't!
MS. HUSSA
Don’t lie. I know you took part in
this. I just don’t know how. What
shall we do with you now? Expel
you?
Suddenly her secretary, MS. JAMILA, enters the room. Ms.
Hussa stops and looks at the folder in her hand.
Wajda looks down and notices her black stone. She quickly
pockets it.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
(To Ms. Jamila)
Just a moment please.
(To Wajda)
You may go back to your class.
We'll finish this matter later.
Wajda takes her notebooks off of the desk and puts them
slowly back into her backpack. She walks towards the door.

24.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
And Wajda, wear normal black shoes
like all the other girls!
33

INT. MRS. HUSSA’S OFFICE/CORRIDOR - DAY

33

Wajda stands outside and listens.
MS. HUSSA
Call Wajda's Mother and see if she
can come in for a meeting tomorrow.
We have to decide once and for all,
what to do about that girl.
Wajda becomes terrified.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Now what is this?
MS. JAMILA (O.S.)
The proposal for the Koran
competition in the religion club.
We just need your signature to
request the prize money awards.
$800 riyals.
Wajda’s ears perk up at the amount of money.

Thinks…

MS. HUSSA (O.S.)
At least we have something good to
show the superintendant. Thank God
not all the girls are delinquents.
All right, let’s get started on it.
Wajda’s heart races. She pulls together all her courage and
knocks on Ms. Hussa's door.
34

INT. MS. HUSSA'S OFFICE - DAY
Ms. Hussa takes a deep breath, and looks at Wajda, who
nervously crosses her feet to cover her black high tops.
WAJDA
I thought about what you said. I
was wrong and am ready to change. I
would like to join the religious
club.
MS. HUSSA
(incredulous)
You are becoming a Shiekha
all of a sudden?

34

25.
WAJDA
Maybe I'll learn something. You
know… to put me on the righteous
path.
Ms. Hussa peers at her, suspiciously.
MS. HUSSA
I will call your Mother tomorrow
and speak to her about this. If we
agree, it’s your last chance.
35

INT. THE KITCHEN - EVENING
Wajda's Mother makes margoog, working handfuls of dough
between her hands while she sings. Wajda cuts the dough as
the Mother puts some in the pan.
MOTHER
I'll write you a love letter. Tell
you how much I miss you…
WAJDA
Don't you wish you were a singer?
You sing so well!
Wajda's Mother feigns shock.
MOTHER
Never! I seek refuge to God from
what you said! Woman's voices
shouldn't carry beyond the front
door.
Her Mother continues singing, now performing dramatically.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I'll write you a love letter;
Tells you how much I miss you.
Explains my pain in your absence.
Wajda joins her Mother in singing.
WAJDA AND HER MOTHER
Why did you leave? You forgot our
nights? I'll write you a love
letter…
Wajda and her Mother laugh together. After a moment…

35

26.
WAJDA
So I've saved up 87 riyals already
and I only need 413 to get the
bicyc-MOTHER
(annoyed)
Ouuuff! Again! We closed this
subject! You are not getting a
bicycle. It is haram!
They stand in silence while they cook idly. Wajda sighs and
after a moment smiles and looks away casually.
WAJDA
They said I need to wear the full
abbayah to school from now on. I
also registered in the religious
studies club.
The Mother smiles reluctantly.
MOTHER
Wow, wearing the full abbayah now,
religious study, someone has become
a woman, maybe we will marry you
off!
WAJDA
(scowling)
Ha ha. That's not funny.
Her Mother tries not to smile, acting busy with her cooking.
She puts last bit of dough in the pan, washes her hands and
goes to the bedroom.
MOTHER
Come with me.
36

INT. WAJDA'S PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT

36

The Mother pulls out an abbayah from the cabinet and hands it
to Wajda.
MOTHER
Try this.
(laughing) )
It might be long for you. Carry it
like this:
Her Mother bunches her dress up in her hands and walks around
the room as if she were wearing high heels. Wajda copies her
exaggerated movements.

27.
WAJDA
Just like Ms. Hussa!
(bashful) )
Oh no, a thief!
She shakes her butt and pretends to scamper away.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
I know! The girls told me the
story about the thief that jumped
the fence of their house to see
her…
MOTHER
(suppressing a smile)
Shame on you, talking like this.
We don't know, it could have been a
thief.
They burst into laughter together. Wajda puts on the abbayah
and the veil while her Mother looks out the window.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Your Uncle’s wedding is coming up,
you know. I have to buy something
really nice so all the other women
know what they’re up against.
Wajda turns to her Mother, all in black. The phone RINGS.
37

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

37

Her Mother talks on the phone while checking the margoog.
MOTHER
I'm so sorry, Leila. Iqbal our
driver is so rude. He shouted at
poor Aiesha today. Aiesha who never
raises her voice! She cried the
whole three hours on the way home.
38

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - EVENING

38

Wajda counts her money. The abbayah is on the bed. She goes
to the list with "500 Riyals" written at the top, crosses out
"25 Riyals" and counts and sorts the banknotes she has.
WAJDA
45, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 81, 82,
83, 84, 85, 86...87 riyals.
She writes "87 riyals" on the chart.

28.
MOTHER (O.S.)
Leila, dear, we're completely full.
Honestly, you'd be better off with
another driver.
Wajda kisses the money with an enthusiastic "smack" and puts
it in the drawer.
MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Really? Abeer? Daughter of Mariam?
How did she even end up in a car
with him? Who is he? Of course,
he’s a playboy like his Father.
(laughs)
You have to admit, he is good
looking.
Wajda sits up on the edge of the chair, concerned.
MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Religious police? Mariam must be
dying! They should have married her
off a long time ago. Pretty girls
are like curses.
They hear the front door open and someone come in.
39

INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY

39

MOTHER
I have to go, our Father has just
come. Keep me in the loop on this
Abeer scandal. Yalla bye.
She quickly hangs up, removes her bandana and fixes her hair.
40

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY
Wajda sits in her room waiting and looking concerned. Her
Mother peeks in.
MOTHER
Go and say hello to your Father as
I prepare his dinner. What's wrong?
Are you okay? Don't worry we won't
marry you
off…
(smiling)
Not just yet!

29.
41

INT. THE MAJLIS - DAY

41

Her Father sits on the floor playing a video game on the TV.
His gutra and Oqal are folded up next to him with a brand new
cell phone on top. A string of light blue prayer beads are
next to him as well. He turns and smiles at her.
Wajda walks past him to a side table and casually turns a
framed certificate of excellence in math towards him. He
quickly glances at it. She collapses casually onto the couch.
FATHER
I'm losing, I should have stayed
with my usual fighter.
On the screen a warrior rests, haggard from the fight.
FATHER (CONT’D)
(teasing)
So is that a real certificate or a
fake one like you made last year?
WAJDA
What?! I'm great at math, do you
want to hear…
(mispronouncing it)
pythagoreium’s theory? It's a
miracle of God, all the things come
out the same!
FATHER
Sounds like you know what you’re
talking about.
He laughs and continues playing. She waits a moment, then…
WAJDA
I'm saving to buy a bicycle!
Her Father is so focused on his game he doesn’t hear her. He
loses and the MUSIC announces the end of the match. He leans
back.
FATHER
Oh, where is the margoog? Didn't
your Mother finish cooking?
Wajda watches him as he runs his prayer beads idly between
his fingers. Her Mother enters and sets dishes on a little
mat on the floor just beside the Father who lights up at her
presence. She is all dressed up, looking her best.

30.
FATHER (CONT’D)
Wajda, who is this movie star who
just entered? Look at this hair, a
beautiful black waterfall of silk!
The Mother tosses back her hair, pleased, but hiding it.
MOTHER
Cut it out!
(teasing, yet bitter)
A movie star huh? Then why is your
Mother checking all over town for
available women for you?
The Father looks up and their eyes meet with pained looks. He
reaches out and puts his hand on hers. She pauses for a
second and looks at him tenderly. She playfully pulls her
hand away and tosses her hair over her shoulder.
He bursts into a charming laugh and pulls her towards him.
Wajda watches them together, happily.
FATHER
I'm not sure she's working that
hard! Sit and play with me!
She laughs seductively while she frees herself and continues
setting up the plates.
WAJDA
Let me play! I'll take the old guy!
Prepare to die!
She jumps off the couch while the Father is laughing.
42

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

42

Wajda sits in class, looking out the doorway into the
corridor. Suddenly she sees her Mother walking with Ms Hussa
to her office and goes rigid.
Her Mother nervously fixes her hair and adjusts her blouse.
43

EXT. STREETS IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP - DAY
Frazzled, Wajda walks quickly home staring straight ahead.
She looks up and sees the bicycle in front of the shop.
The Toy Shop Owner sits, drinking tea with ANOTHER MAN. A
BEARDED MAN approaches.
The other man puts down his tea cup and quickly exits.

43

31.
The Owner gets up to walk into the store with the Bearded
Man. The owner is trying to be cordial with him.
The man breaks one of the toys.
Wajda hurries off. She hears the man shouting.
BEARDED MAN (O.S.)
No idols! Don't you fear God?
44

INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY

44

The Mother cleans a pile of dishes from the previous night.
One slips off her shaking hands and falls to the ground. She
leans on the edge of the sink and yells loudly.
MOTHER
All this for a bicycle that you'll
never have as long as I'm alive. Do
you think I'll wait around until
you get expelled?!!
45

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

45

Wajda covers her ears as her Mother breaks another dish - on
purpose this time. Wajda turns on the radio to a ROCK SONG.
MOTHER (O.S.)
And turn off that damn radio and
those evil songs! You're no better
than Abeer. She's staying home and
her parents are marrying her off.
And that is what we'll do with you
too! There's no school for you
tomorrow!
Wajda turns it off and lies down, looking at her shoes.
46

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Wajda's Mother paces, talking on the phone, agitated.
MOTHER
I know Iqbal, but my daughter had a
problem at school. I didn't have
time to tell you. You're paid for
the trip whether I am there or not.
Don't come tomorrow.
(pause)
How dare you speak to me that way?
(MORE)

46

32.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
Do you think you are the only
driver in town?… Fine! I'll find
someone else!
She SLAMS the phone down hard and leans back into the couch.
47

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - NIGHT

47

Wajda sits on her bed with her knee to her chin, coloring in
the white toe and sole of her shoe with a black marker. She
pulls out the colored laces and sadly replaces them with
black twine from her bracelets.
We hear the door opening and her Father comes in. Wajda tries
to listen.
MOTHER (O.S.)
Really? I should pay for it? Why
can’t you pay for something for
once?
FATHER (O.S.)
What about your transportation
allowance? You should use it
instead of doing that group where
you all pool your money.
Wajda puts down her shoes and leans her head on the door.
MOTHER (O.S.)
Yeah, and what about the dowry
money, you handsome groom?
FATHER (O.S.)
Do you think I want to support two
families? I'm the joke of the town.
Are you going to give me a son? We
both know that is not going to
happen.
(frustrated)
Forget it, and don't count on me
coming next week at all!
MOTHER (O.S.)
(yelling after him)
I don't care! Go to your mother’s
house to discuss potential brides
all night!
A door SLAMS, then only silence. Wajda's eyes fall on the
chart she made to map out her savings for the bicycle.

33.
48

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

48

As Wajda prepares to leave for school she looks through the
half open door of her Mother's room. Her Mother’s talking on
the phone, her hair a mess, looking exhausted.
MOTHER
Can't you count it as emergency
leave? I still have some days. You
know I've been working hard,
covering for everyone. I'll open up
for the entire month if I have to.
Okay, thank you, see you tomorrow.
She hangs up, distraught then sees Wajda through the doorway.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Where do you think you're going?
Didn't you hear me yesterday?
WAJDA
I sorted everything out with Ms.
Hussa!
MOTHER
Back to your room and don't come
out. I don't want to see you today
at all, I don't want to hear a peep
from you - nothing!
WAJDA
Aren't you going to work today?
MOTHER
(sarcastic)
No darling, I'm staying here to
watch over you. Happy?
The Mother gets into bed and rolls over, covering herself
with the blanket.
49

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

49

Wajda turns on the RADIO and lowers the volume until it’s
barely audible. She looks through her doorway at the housekeys hanging by the front door. She can see her Mother on the
couch, smoking, watching TV, completely depressed.
50

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Wajda sneaks past her Mother to the stairwell to the roof.

50

34.
51

EXT. COURTYARD OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY

51

Wajda carefully lowers herself down a pipe along the side of
the house. She slips and her black rock falls from her pocket
onto the ground. Through the window she sees her Mother cover
herself and rush over. She pulls herself against the wall and
freezes. The Mother looks out, cautiously. Wajda holds onto
the pipe, holding her breath. Her Mother finally returns to
the couch and Wajda lowers herself down.
She opens the gate, takes gum out of her mouth and sticks in
into the lock so it doesn't close completely.
52

EXT. ABDULLAH'S SCHOOL - DAY

52

Wajda waits by the boys' school, hiding behind a wall, until
Abdullah finally arrives on his bicycle. Wajda throws a stone
next to him and he looks over, surprised to see her.
WAJDA
Do you know how to go to Adira?
53

EXT. ADIRA STREET - DAY

53

Wajda rides on the back of Abdullah's bicycle as he pedals
them along. As they pass the toy shop she sees the green
bicycle glimmer in the distance. His feet spin the pedals.
ABDULLAH
You have to get off once we see
someone on the road. I don't want
people to talk about me. And cover
your face, I'll say you're my
sister!
WAJDA
No one will believe you, I'm too
good looking to be related to you!
ABDULLAH
Yeah right. And isn't the principal
going to call your Mother for
skipping school like this?
WAJDA
I’m taking a personal day.
They approach a busy road. Wajda gets off and walks alongside
him.

35.
They arrive to an older part of the town where foreign
workers pass by. AN INDIAN MAN sits in front of a house,
smoking. Wajda approaches him, cautiously.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Hey, do you know where Iqbal the
driver lives?
THE MAN
Do you know how many "Iqbal"
drivers there are around here,
little girl?
Wajda shrugs. They continue searching the area, from one
street to the other. Wajda suddenly sees the minibus with the
taped headlights parked next to a dilapidated house. She
moves closer and looks into the car. She sees the picture of
the little girl placed on the dashboard.
She motions for Abdullah to knock at the door, but he shakes
his head and stands behind his bicycle.
ABDULLAH
It’s your war!
Fine!

WAJDA

Wajda frowns at him and knocks at the door. She waits several
moments and looks over at Abdullah, who looks away, ashamed.
She knocks again and the door slowly opens.
Iqbal stumbles out, rubs sleep from his eyes and sees Wajda.
IQBAL
You! What do you want?
WAJDA
You can't do this! You..you..
Wajda is overtaken by emotion and cannot speak. Iqbal
dismisses her and tries to close the door. Suddenly Abdullah
puts his foot inside.
ABDULLAH
(assertively)
Where is your Iqamah (residency
card)?
Iqbal looks at him threateningly, enraged.
Go away!

IQBAL

36.
ABDULLAH
(more assertively)
It is a good job, there are no
problems. Just go back to it and
we'll all forget about this
incident. Do you know who my Uncle
is? The one with the moustache?
Have you seen his election posters?
I'm sure he'd be interested to look
further into your legal status.
Abdullah holds his ground as Wajda folds her arms behind him,
looking at Iqbal challengingly.
54

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

54

Wajda laughs hard as she runs after Abdullah, riding ahead on
his bicycle. Wajda mimics him.
WAJDA
“Don't you know my Uncle? With the
giant mustache?”
Abdullah laughs as he dismounts.
ABDULLAH
He knew him, right? That mustache
is a registered trademark!
Abdullah directs her attention to a house busy with MEN
coming in and out. He directs her away from the scene.
ABDULLAH (CONT’D)
Their son put stuff around his
waist that blows up and died. Boom!
He acts out pulling a cord and makes an explosive noise.
WAJDA
He's crazy! That must have hurt.
ABDULLAH
No, if you die for God, it's like a
prick of a needle, and then you fly
up and you have seventy women!
Really?

WAJDA

She acts out a big explosion.

37.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Boom! Seventy bicycles!
Abdullah leans his bicycle against the wall and runs towards
a small grocery store. He shouts back to her.
ABDULLAH
It doesn't work that way. Stay with
the bicycle so no one steals it.
Wajda leans on it and strikes a pose ala Marlon Brando in the
"The Wild One.”
55

INT. COURTYARD OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY

55

Wajda looks through the window at her Mother, lying on the
couch. As soon as she gets up, Wajda ducks down quickly. She
waits for her Mother to go to the bathroom and then sneaks
inside.
56

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

56

Wajda lies on her bed, exhausted. She looks over at her
savings chart and sorts her money again.
WAJDA
60, 70, 80, 85, 86, 87 riyals…
Her Mother pokes her head inside and Wajda shoves the money
under her pillow, feigning innocence and repentance.
MOTHER
Had enough?
Wajda nods.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Tomorrow you can return to school,
but you are joining that religious
club, like you told Ms. Hussa.
57

INT. THE MOSQUE - DAY

57

Wajda's black converses dangle above the floor while she sits
at a row of desks with twenty other girls. On the blackboard
the KORAN TEACHER writes "The Religious Club: Agenda" then
turns to the class.

38.
KORAN TEACHER
Let's compile all the stories we
know about torment in the grave and
make a pamphlet for the whole
school. Any ideas?
NOURA
(raising her hand)
I want to tell the story of the
giant snake from Hell that was sent
to torture the girl that did not
pray after she died.
Wadja is busy drawing a picture of a bicycle when she hears
Ms. Hussa’s high heels approach. Behind Wajda, Yasmine
whispers to Noura, giggling.
YASMINE
There was a thief at Ms. Hussa's
house…
NOURA
It was her lover, not a thief! Her
Father thought it was a thief and
called the police!
A conservative older girl, SALMA, shushes them.
SALMA
If she said it was a thief, then it
was a thief.
NOURA
(rolling her eyes)
Of course you would think that,
Salma. The only man that would ever
speak to you would have to be a
thief.
Salma looks down, eyes watering. The girls giggle then
compose themselves as Ms. Hussa enters.
KORAN TEACHER
Girls, Ms. Hussa is here to explain
the Koranic competition rules. It's
only five weeks away. I'll pass
around a sign up sheet.
The teacher hands out the sheet as Wajda tuns the page to
hide the bicycle drawing. Ms. Hussa glances at Wajda, then at
the class.

39.
MS. HUSSA
First, we've increased the amount
for the prize. It is now 1,000
instead of 800 riyals. You'll have
to learn all the long suras (the
first 4 chapters of the Koran).
Wajda raises her eyebrows. She flips through the Koran on
her desk and measures the amount of paper she would have to
learn.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
The competition is two parts:
you’ll to study the associated
vocabulary along with the reasons
why the verses were descended from
heaven. You also have to learn the
verses and the proper recitation.
The correct tone, rhythm and pacing
are very important.
Wajda sneaks a look at her bicycle drawing and watches the
sign up sheet as it passes from one girl to another,
nervously. Salma is the first to sign up followed by Noura
and then Yasmine…
The sheet finally comes to her and Wajda scribbles her name.
Noura raises an eyebrow and looks to Yasmine as Wajda smugly
brings it up, hands it to intrigued Ms. Hussa and smiles.
58

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP - DAY

58

Walking home from school, Wajda stops, checks out the bicycle
and then walks inside with determination.
59

INT. TOY SHOP - DAY
She exchanges a glance with The Owner as he counts his
receipts. He flips over a record on the player.
WAJDA
Do you know they invented a new
thing called a tape player?
TOY SHOP OWNER
Do you plan on buying anything?
WAJDA
How would I know? People need to
browse, don't they?

59

40.
Nonchalantly, she walks around in the aisles pretending to
look at other toys. Her eyes stay focused on the bicycle
section. She looks up to see The Owner looking at her as he
organizes his records and she quickly turns away.
She heads to the computer game section and looks at one that
says "Learn the Koran the easy way." She studies it,
thinking.
TOY SHOP OWNER
You won't find any tapes back
there. We only have CD's.
He smiles, mockingly. Wajda looks back, suppressing a smile.
WAJDA
Thank you very much! See you
tomorrow
On her way out the door Wajda slowly passes by the bicycle
and runs her fingers through the ribbons on the handlebars.
TOY SHOP OWNER
Can you even ride one?
WAJDA
(confidently)
Ride? I race the wind.
Wajda trips as she exits. The Owner laughs in amusement and
turns up the record player.
60

INT. PHOTO SHOP - DAY

60

Wajda walks up to the counter and pulls out a photo.
WAJDA
Can you put this picture on a mug?
The picture shows a veiled woman holding a smiling baby girl.
61

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

61

As Wajda waits for her mug, at the front of the store, she
throws her rock idly up in the air, keeping an eye on the
bicycle next door.
Abdullah rides up on his bicycle, which is loaded down with
rolls of lights and extension cords.

41.
ABDULLAH
Hey, where's your bicycle? I
thought you're getting the nice
green one! HA!
WAJDA
(furious)
I will, I have a plan.
ABDULLAH
(laughing)
I'm sure you do, but it doesn't
seem to be working.
As he pedals away, the shopkeeper comes out and hands Wajda
the mug. She takes 15 riyals out of her pocket, looks at the
money, sighs and reluctantly hands it to him.
Wajda runs after Abdullah, determined to catch him. He laughs
and tries to pedal away, but is weighed down by the lights.
Wajda closes in on him, and pulls him down to the ground by
grabbing the string of lights over his shoulder.
WAJDA
(breathing heavily)
I just signed up for a Koranic
recitation competition. I'll get a
thousand riyals by the end of the
semester. I'll buy a bicycle and a
helmet like people on TV. I will
race you and win!
ABDULLAH
Yeah… Race me and win… In your
dreams, little girl!
He laughs again, gets back on the bicycle and pedals off.
WAJDA
(yells)
I caught you didn't I?
ABDULLAH
I let you catch me!
62

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY
Wajda counts her remaining money.
WAJDA
57, 58, 59, 60, 61...62 riyals.

62

42.
She sighs, picks up the mug, and stares at the picture on it.
63

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

63

The TV is on, muted, in the background. Wajda lays on the
floor. She looks up at the TV and sees a commercial for the
movie the “Matrix”. Wajda's Mother, holding a phone to her
ear, looks at her disapprovingly. Her Mother collects herself
and turns away from Wajda. Her hair is up, with a few curls
dangling seductively on her neck. She smiles, flirtatiously.
MOTHER
Come on, don't you miss us? It’s
been almost two weeks. Are you
punishing us or have you already
found someone new?… If I'm the
original brand, why do you look for
imitation?
After flirting with the Father her Mother hangs up, worried,
goes into her room and makes another call. Wajda takes the
chance to put the mug on the table.
MOTHER (O.S.)(CONT’D)
I collected the money from the
other girls for you, Leila. It’s
been with me for sometime now.
Aren't you coming to take it?…
Really! You're working in the
hospital across the road? What did
your husband say? Doesn't he mind
you working with men?!
(pause)
What? Yes, great, we're home.
She hangs up. Wajda watches her go to her dresser and pull a
wad of money from a drawer. The doorbell RINGS. Her Mother
notices Wajda's curiosity and starts to close the door.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Go see who it is.
64

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

64

Wajda opens the door and sees Abdullah, holding a rolled up
extension cord over his shoulder. They stare at each other in
a confrontational way. Wajda acts annoyed.
WAJDA
What do you want?

43.
ABDULLAH
My Uncle wants me to string up
these lights all the way down the
street. Can I attach them to your
roof? And by the way you never said
thank you!
WAJDA
Use the neighbors; we don't care
about your Uncle or his mustache.
Thanks for what?
ABDULLAH
(annoyed)
They don't have a pole to hang them
on. Yours is the only roof that
will work. "Thanks" for taking you
all the way to Adira and fixing the
driver situation. He’s taking your
Mother again, right?
WAJDA
(looking at his bicycle)
Hold on.
She slams the door and runs to her Mother's room.
65

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

65

WAJDA
(yelling through the door)
Hey Mother! Abdulla Al Noufi wants
to use our roof to string up lights
for the election so his Uncle with
the mustache will win.
Her Mother opens the door, holding the mug, smiling at Wajda.
Wajda smiles back upon seeing the mug.
MOTHER
Thank you, sweetie. You were such a
cute baby.
(frowning suddenly)
Tell the boy to go away. His Uncle
is not even from our tribe and we
will not vote for him.
66

EXT. FRONT OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - EVENING
Abdullah stands, impatiently. Wajda comes back, thinks.

66

44.
WAJDA
(casually)
I'll let you onto the roof if you
bring your bicycle.
They look at each other defiantly across the doorway.
They both turn as a minibus full of foreign, mostly Filipino,
nurses stops in front of their building. A fully covered
Saudi woman, LEILA, jumps out. The minibus waits, idling.
Leila hurries up the stairs towards Wajda. She accidentally
bumps into Abdullah as he tries to move out of the way.
LEILA
Hey Wajda, it's me Leila.
She removes her veil and exposes her face, smiling.
LEILA (CONT’D)
You look so grown up and cute!
Wajda glances at Abdullah, making sure he heard the
compliment. He gets on his bicycle and pedals away.
LEILA (CONT’D)
Can you call your Mother? The bus
is waiting.
Just then her Mother appears behind her. She stands just
behind the front gate, hiding from strangers.
MOTHER
You traitor! I can't believe you're
working so close to my house
without even telling me!
67

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
LEILA
(laughing)
Working at the hospital is great.
It pays more, they provide
transportation and I don't have to
endure someone like Iqbal for three
hours every day!
Both women laugh. Wajda's Mother hands Leila the money.
LEILA (CONT’D)
Thank you, dear. When is your turn?

67

45.
MOTHER
Next month. I want to buy a nice
dress for her Uncle's engagement.
She gestures at Wajda, kicking a rock on the ground.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
All the other potential wives will
be attending his brother's wedding
as well.
LEILA
God be with the one he chooses-You might rip her heart out that
night!
Wajda laughs and the Mother glares at her.
LEILA (CONT’D)
Is he going to drive you to the
wedding so he sees you before you
go to the women's section?
MOTHER
No, his Mother is taking us in a
cab!
The minivan HONKS.
LEILA
Ugh. I have to go. Oh before I
forget, they're hiring at the
hospital. Think about it. It’s
closer and we can chat all day!
MOTHER
(rolls her eyes)
My husband would kill me. He's so
jealous. He couldn't stand the
thought of other men looking at me!
LEILA
(laughing)
Cut it out! You blame everything on
him. If you change your mind, call
me! I'll keep an application at
reception for you.
As she leaves, the Mother watches Leila, enviously.

46.
68

INT. THE MOSQUE - DAY

68

Wajda's black colored shoes sit in a pile with all of the
others by the door. The girls sit on the floor in a circle.
Wajda sits patiently, focused on the teacher.
The Koran Teacher has Salma pass out a copy to each student
from a small shelf in the corner of the room.
KORAN TEACHER
Now girls let's start our program.
But before we start, I know some of
you may have gotten your period, so
you are not allowed to touch the
Koran.
Some of the girls GIGGLE.
KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
This isn't a laughing matter. You
are young ladies now. Your bodies
are fragile like flowers and there
are dangers lurking around every
corner. All right, let's read.
Yasmine flips the pages, using a Kleenex. The teacher looks
at Wajda, sarcastically.
KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Let's start with the new face in
our group - Wajda. Start with Surat
al Nisa, from ayat 59.
Wajda slowly opens the book, looks at the pages, and looks at
the teacher. The teacher looks at her sternly.
WAJDA
(reading in broken pacing)
O you who have believed, obey Allah
and obey the Messenger and those in
authority among you. And if you
disagree over anything...
KORAN TEACHER
(correcting her)
…refer it to Allah and the
Messenger...
WAJDA
(repeating the teacher)
...Refer it to Allah and the
Messenger, if you should believe in
Allah and the Last Day. That is the
best [way] and best in result...

47.
KORAN TEACHER
(holding out her hand)
Stop, please. Noura, continue.
NOURA
(in perfect harmony)
...refer it to Allah and the
Messenger, if you should believe in
Allah and the Last Day. That is the
best [way] and best in result
KORAN TEACHER
Beautiful as always, Noura.
Wajda looks at Noura with extreme envy.
69

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

69

Fatin and Fatima once again look at a football magazine and
take off their shoes to paint their toenails.
FATIMA
Where is the blue nail polish? I
hid it under there the other day.
Wajda approaches but ducks back just as Ms. Hussa swoops down
on the two girls.
Fatin and Fatima cover their feet, looking panicked. They
push the magazine under each other's clothes.
MS. HUSSA
What are you doing here? Why were
your hands under her skirt?
The girls freeze in their tracks. Wajda stands motionless,
watching.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
This is all we need at our school:
two girls hiding in the back yard,
putting their hands all over each
other! Tell me what that means?
The girls recoil from each other, mortified.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
“Sorry” isn’t going to cut it this
time. In my office. Now!

48.
70

EXT. SCHOOL - LATER

70

Wajda sees Fatin and Fatima leaving the school, extremely
upset. They pull their veils down covering their angry faces.
Crowds of girls bump past Wajda, all wearing black abbayahs.
Wajda wearily puts on hers as well.
71

INT. THE TOY SHOP - DAY

71

Wajda heads straight to the bicycle and runs her hand over
it. She sees that it is locked down with a chain. The Owner
comes out with a box.
TOY SHOP OWNER
What are you doing? Still browsing?
WAJDA
No. I know what I’m here to get.
She picks up the "Learn the Koran the Easy way" game while
the owner restocks the shelves, watching her.
How much?

WAJDA (CONT’D)

TOY SHOP OWNER
Only 80 riyals… Cheaper than a
bicycle.
WAJDA
(in a polite tone)
How about 62?
72

EXT. THE ROOF OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY

72

Wajda sits on Abdullah's bicycle, trying to turn it in
circles on the small flat surface of the roof. She awkwardly
pedals and turns, barely keeping her balance.
Abdullah fastens a hook with lights attached. He looks over
at a crudely constructed mess of metal hanging off the edge.
ABDULLAH
What is that?
She looks at him defensively, offended.
WAJDA
What do you think? It's an
antennae. I can get signals from
beyond your world on that thing.
(MORE)

49.
WAJDA (CONT'D)
How do you think I make my "Awesome
Mix Tapes”?
ABDULLAH
(while he works)
With all the people shouting?
“Awesome” indeed. My Uncle now
listens to the Koran radio station.
He will speak on the channel now.
They have all those famous Koran
readers. “It makes your heart
melt,” my Uncle says.
WAJDA
(her hand over her heart)
He should hear my Mother sing! She
should have a channel of her own.
Wajda leans over against the railing to push herself along on
the bicycle. She idly switches a broken bare light-bulb on
and off on the side wall.
ABDULLAH
Stop, you'll burn it out!
WAJDA
It doesn't work anyway.
She looks down at the campaign tent.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Why does your Uncle look different
now?
In the poster the Uncle has shaved his mustache and has grown
out a big beard.
ABDULLAH
Didn't you hear? Men shouldn't
shave their beards! It is haram!
What do they teach you at school?
WAJDA
(challengingly)
I don’t know. “Women’s stuff.”
Our “special days of the month”...
She bursts into fits of laughter as Abdullah, embarrassed,
goes back to work. Wajda balances awkwardly on the bicycle
and RINGS the little bell.

50.
ABDULLAH
(smiling while he works)
Everyone in the neighborhood will
hear you ringing that bell.
WAJDA
Who cares? Look, I'm a natural.
She swerves and falls hard. Abdullah giggles.
ABDULLAH
Yeah right. All that fuss for a
bicycle and you don't even know how
to ride?
WAJDA
How would I? Where would I ride a
bicycle?
She makes a face as Abdullah jumps up and stands behind her.
Go ahead.

ABDULLAH

He holds the bicycle steady and trots alongside her while she
goes in circles around the edge of the roof.
73

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - NIGHT

73

Wajda sits on her bed tuning her radio. She stops, lingers,
then idly turns to the Koran station.
ANNOUNCER
You are listening to the one and
only Koran station. Tune in to hear
your favorite readers. Now, Al
Hudafi will recite Surat al Baqara.
READER (V.O.)
In the name of Allah, the
Beneficent, the Merciful. Alif Lam
Mim. This Book, there is no doubt
in it, is a guide to those who
guard against evil.
She lies down in her bed listening.
Her gaze falls on the video game she just bought. Her Mother
comes in and closes the Koran.
MOTHER
Don't leave the Koran open! Satan
will spit in it!

51.
Wajda jumps up, takes the video game box and leaves.
74

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

74

Wajda sits on the floor trying to hook the game to the small
TV in the living room. She fiddles around with the cords.
WAJDA
This game doesn't work on our
“state-of-the-art TV”.
Her Mother looks perplexed, then realizes.
MOTHER
Don't even think of it. Your
Father will go mad if you mess up
his TV.
Wajda sighs, staring at the locked Majlis door, where her
Father's TV sits.
75

INT. THE MOSQUE - DAY

75

Wajda listens as the teacher finishes a lesson passionately.
KORAN TEACHER
Wajda, what do you think?
Wajda takes a moment and exchanges a glance with Noura, who
elbows Yasmine and rolls her eyes.
WAJDA
I think this competition is very
hard for me.
Noura and the girls all giggle.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
But I heard on the Koran channel
yesterday that if it is easy for
you, you get only one reward. But
if it is hard for you to read and
remember you get two rewards. One
for reading the Koran and one for
the trouble you go through!
KORAN TEACHER
Thank you, Wajda, for sharing this
with us. Girls, I want you all to
take Wajda as an example of a
person who tries hard and is
devoted to God.

52.
Noura and her cronies look dumbfounded.
WAJDA
(surprised)
Thank you!
ANOTHER TEACHER passes by and motions for the Koran teacher.
They talk for a moment. She looks over at Wajda.
KORAN TEACHER
Ms. Hussa said she needs to see
you. Go to her room now. I told her
how well you're doing.
76

INT. MS. HUSSA'S OFFICE - DAY

76

Wajda stands nervously in front of Ms. Hussa's desk.
MS. HUSSA
Wajda, I have to say, I didn’t
believe it but apparently you’re
doing well in class. If this is a
permanent thing I will be very
impressed.
Wajda puts on a polite smile. Ms. Hussa looks through a
filing cabinet. She deliberately pulls out a file, looks at
it, and puts it on her desk.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
You may not believe it, but I was a
little reckless at your age too.
And look at me now.
Wajda watches Ms. Hussa sit back and thumb through the file.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
If you keep going the way you’re
going, I believe you may actually
be able to win this competition.
She leans over and presses a button on the intercom.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Ms. Jamila? Please come by later
and pick up the Koran competition
file. All of the questions are
complete now. Thank you.
She leans back in her chair and pushes the folder to the
front of her desk, towards Wajda.

53.
MS.HUSSA
I'll bet the other girls would die
to know what is in that folder.
Wajda looks at the folder on the desk, puzzled. A KNOCK and
then and Fatin and Fatima walk in.
MS. HUSSA
Close the door, please.
Fatin politely turns, closes the door and stands next to
Fatima. Wajda is surprised to see the girls and shuffles her
feet nervously. Ms. Hussa sits back.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
So you still insist that you
weren't doing anything there behind
the school?
FATIMA
We were reading magazines and
that's all, but nothing like what
you mentioned.
(to Wajda)
Ask her!
Ms. Hussa taps her fingers on the folder on her desk, looking
at Wajda.
Wajda looks at the girls, who look at her confidently, sure
she will back them up. Wajda looks at Ms. Hussa, then looks
down uncomfortably.
WAJDA
I'm not sure. I was standing far
away.
The girls gawk at her in disbelief. Wajda avoids their gaze.
Ms. Hussa looks at the girls, smugly. They stare at Wajda.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Well, I was worried the men on the
faraway building would recognize me
because of my vest…
She pauses as Ms. Hussa looks at her with slight impatience.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
It's a very distinct vest.

54.
MS. HUSSA
I see. Thank you, that's enough. So
we may never know if they were just
painting their toe nails as they
said. There wasn't even any nail
polish.
Ms. Hussa looks accusingly at the two girls, then to Wajda
with a satisfied smile.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Wajda, thank you very much, you may
return to your class. Please take
this folder out to my secretary,
Ms. Jamila. And close the door
behind you.
Wajda takes the folder from Ms. Hussa and turns to leave. The
taller girls move out of the way so she can exit. They tower
over her, glaring as her tiny figure passes between them.
77

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

77

Wajda stands in the empty corridor, staring at the folder in
her hands. She opens the folder and is about to read as the
conversation carries over from Ms. Hussa's office
MS. HUSSA (O.S.)
It's only a few words, just sign it
and we will all forget it.
FATIN (O.S.)
(almost crying)
No! We weren't touching each other!
The bell RINGS and the NOISE of OTHER GIRLS overwhelms the
scene. Wajda looks at the folder and back towards Hussa’s
office. She closes the folder and enters the next room.
78

INT. MS. JAMILA'S OFFICE - DAY

78

Ms. Jamila is by a cabinet. She looks at Wajda as she enters.
MS. JAMILA
Is that the competition folder?
WAJDA
(handing it to her)
Yes, Ms. Hussa told me to give this
to you.
As she hands it over and leaves Ms. Jamila opens the folder.

55.
MS. JAMILA
Weird, the pages are empty.
79

INT. WAJDA'S ROOM - DAY

79

The FAJR prayer RINGS out. Wajda's Mother wakes her up,
tenderly.
MOTHER
Wake up, little troublemaker, it's
time for school.
Wajda rubs the sleep from her eyes and looks over at the
bottle of blue nail polish next to her money-saving chart.
80

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

80

Wajda stands on a stool next to her Mother as they wash for
prayer.
WAJDA
I saw girls on TV riding bicycles.
Why don't you give me the money to
buy it? I know you have money. I
saw it in the drawer.
MOTHER
Here, girls don't ride bicycles.
You will not be able to have
children if you ride a bicycle!
WAJDA
You don't ride a bicycle and you
can't have children!
Her Mother drops her towel on the floor, turning to Wajda in
anguish.
MOTHER
How could you say that? I almost
died having you! Wash for prayer!
81

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
They put their prayer rugs in place and line up to pray.
WAJDA
(provocatively)
I’m not going to school today. Go
ahead, marry me off.

81

56.
MOTHER
You want to stay home? Fine. But we
are going to the mall for my dress
the second I come home today!
Water DRIPS from the faucet in the bathroom. The sound mixes
with the IMAM’S VOICE announcing the start of FAJR prayer
from the nearby mosque.
IMAM (O.S.)
Qad qamat Al Slalah
The mother gets ready and raises her hands up near to her
ears. Wajda follows.
MOTHER
Allhu Akbar.
She moves her lips silently reciting the prayer.
82

EXT. FRONT OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

82

Wajda's Mother rushes out of the front gate with all of her
supplies, followed by Wajda. The Mother looks up to see the
string of lights attached to their roof. She looks down at
Wajda, who looks away, still upset. Her Mother takes her
things and gets into the car.
MOTHER
(indicating the lights)
We'll talk about that later.
Iqbal glares at Wajda. She sticks a finger under her nose,
indicating a mustache, reminiscent of Abdullah’s threat.
Iqbal hurries back into the car, spewing curses. The bus
jolts away, blowing gray smoke as they embark.
83

INT. WAJDA'S PARENT'S ROOM - DAY

83

Wajda opens several drawers in her Mother's dresser. When she
opens the top drawer she moves aside some clothes to reveal a
large wad of money. She flips through the notes, counting
them one by one. She contemplates the money for a while, and
looks over at her Mother’s almost empty closet. She puts the
money back, closes the drawer and leaves.
84

INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY

84

Wajda opens a small box underneath the cabinets next to the
oven and pulls out a ring holding all the house keys.

57.
85

INT. THE MAJLIS - DAY

85

The Majlis door is open with the key in its lock. Wajda sits
in front of her Father's nice, new TV with a game controller
in hand. The video game box is open and empty.
VIDEO GAME
Choose the correct answer: Who are
the Sabians?
The what?

WAJDA

She hits a button.
VIDEO GAME
Incorrect! Try Again. Who are the
Sabians?
WAJDA
Okay, mister..um...
She hits another button.
VIDEO GAME
Incorrect! Try again. Who are the
Sabians?
Frustrated, she throws the console onto the floor.
WAJDA
How am I supposed to know??
Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS.
86

INT. THE STAIRWAY LEADING UP TO THE ROOF - DAY

86

Wajda and Abdullah carry the bicycle up, both out of breath.
WAJDA
I don't care if they memorize
everything. I'll be better! I'll
beat them all! I’m getting good!
Not wanting to argue, Abdullah pushes the bicycle upwards.
87

EXT. THE ROOF OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY
Abdullah puts the bicycle down. Wajda sees that it has two
additional training wheels and gets angry.

87

58.
WAJDA
What is this?
ABDULLAH
It will help you learn. I need to
work on the lights. I can't push
you all day.
Wajda violently smashes the lights, stomping her feet.
WAJDA
I can't recite and I can't ride! I
hate you. And…
She collapses to the floor, crying. Abdullah goes over to the
bicycle, takes off the wheels, then sits next to her.
ABDULLAH
Here, I took them off.
Wajda doesn't move. He reaches into his pocket and takes out
some notes.
ABDULLAH (CONT’D)
I'll give you 5 riyals if you stop
crying.
With one hand covering her eyes, Wajda's other hand reaches
out and snatches the money. She puts it in her pocket, raises
her head and wipes her nose. She looks up at the ribbons on
the handlebars, swaying in the breeze.
She squares her shoulders, gets up and heads over.
88

EXT. IQBAL'S CAR - DAY

88

Wajda and her Mother ride silently in the back of the car. As
they pass the toy shop, Wajda sees The Owner talking to a man
and his son, right by her green bicycle! She can't hear what
they’re saying but can see that they’re bargaining.
She squints out to get a better look as The Owner looks up
and notices her. He smiles while he talks to the man,
explaining something. The car pulls away. When she can no
longer see the toy shop, Wajda sits back, agitated.
Her Mother watches her and looks back at the shop.
IQBAL
Madam, only one hour. I don't have
time to wait for you. You are late,
I go. You find taxi.

59.
MOTHER
(irritated)
We understand that, Iqbal. Enough.
She pretends to text someone to stop him from talking to her.
Wajda looks at the little girl’s picture. She leans forward
and tries to talk to Iqbal.
WAJDA
Who is this little girl, Iqbal?
IQBAL
This is my daughter. I didn’t see
her for 3 years now.
He then shakes his head happy with himself.
IQBAL (CONT’D)
She goes to school now. (pause)I
didn’t go to school.
WAJDA
Obviously you didn’t go to school
because you don’t have manners.
IQBAL
You have a big mouth.
Wajda sticks her tongue out to him. Her mother looks at her
angrily. The car moves quickly across the dessert.
89

INT. THE MALL - DAY

89

Wajda’s Mother passes ahead of her as she stands mesmerized
by a kiosk selling accessories. Quickly she goes to the
salesperson and points to a rack full of bracelets similar to
the one's she made with a sign that says "Only 20 Riyals!"
WAJDA
I make better bracelets than these.
How much will you pay me? 10?
SALESMAN
No thank you, I buy them from
China, I can get like 10,000 for 10
riyals.
WAJDA
China won't do the national colors!
SALESMAN
You mean like this?

60.
As he points to one, she hears her Mother calling her from
the upper level. She runs towards the escalator, shooting the
salesman an angry look.
90

INT. DRESS SHOP - DAY

90

They enter a shop that has an assortment of dresses and gowns
in the window. A red dress stands out among the others.
While they talk, Wajda sits on a chair in the entry-way
watching the action outside. The salesman pulls out the dress
and examines the Mother's covered body.
SALESMAN
It is a beautiful dress but maybe
a little big for you.
The Mother tucks her hands into her abbayah, nervously.
Wajda watches a group of fully veiled women walk past a group
of young men. They turn their heads, flirt with smiles and
laughs. After passing each other, they pull out their cell
phones and text rapidly.
PASSING GIRL
The jerk, he says I have a big ass!
The group of girls laugh and disappear in the long aisle.
MOTHER
What size is it?
Large.

SALESMAN

MOTHER
All right. Can I try it?
SALESMAN
Okay, you can try it on in the
women's bathroom at the end of the
corridor. And if it turns out big,
we can tailor it for you after you
pay a deposit.
The Mother looks at a pair of beautiful red shoes on display.
91

INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM - DAY
The mother in a small bathroom, with Arabic toilet on the
floor. The floor is wet.

91

61.
She is trying to finish zipping it up while holding the edge
of it between her legs so the dress doesn’t get wet.
MOTHER
(whispers)
I know it’s a lot of money but I
have to show your Father he can’t
get anything better than me.
The mother opens the door and shows the dress to Wajda. Wajda
is leaning over the sink and holding her mother’s Abbya.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Do you think your father will like
it?
The dress is too big for her. She pulls the ends of the dress
around her waist to tighten it. Wajda shrugs her shoulders.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Let’s take the dress back to the
salesman so he can tighten it. Then
go quickly before Iqbal gets angry
and leaves us.
The mother raises the dress edge over her feet and enters the
bathroom booth again. Wajda hands the mother her Abbya from
over the door.
WAJDA
Don’t worry, he won’t leave.
92

EXT. THE ROOF OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY

92

Wajda rides the bicycle, more steadily but still awkwardly,
in a circle.
ABDULLAH
I think I'm done with the lights
now.
He looks over the edge. The lights are all aligned
beautifully.
WAJDA
My Mother saw the lights but forgot
to ask me about them again.
ABDULLAH
She doesn't know? Does your Father?

62.
WAJDA
I think they like your Uncle now
that he was on that radio program!
MOTHER (O.S.)
Aiiyyyeee!!!!
They turn, both stunned to see Wajda's Mother at the entrance
of the roof. The mother tries to hide the cigarette in her
hand and put it out secretly.
Wajda tips over, lands hard and hurts herself. She looks up
pleadingly at her Mother.
WAJDA
I'm bleeding… I have blood!
Her Mother grips the railing, screams and covers her eyes.
MOTHER
You stupid-- you think you can act
like boys? Your honor, your honor!
Oh my God, oh my God. Where is the
blood coming from? Where is it
coming from?
WAJDA
(confused)
From my knee...
MOTHER
What? Oh thank God!
She sighs in relief, then grabs Wajda by the shoulder.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Bicycles are dangerous for girls
and you almost saw why!!!
(to Abdullah)
And you!! What were you thinking?
I'll tell your Uncle to teach you
some manners. Get out of here!
Abdullah runs away, panicked. The Mother points at the
bicycle.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
And take that damn thing with you!
Abdullah quickly comes back and picks up the bicycle, then
runs into the stairway, struggling with the bicycle alone.

63.
We hear a loud CRASH as the bicycle falls down the stairs.
Wajda and her Mother look at each other, the Mother trying to
compose herself and then… both burst into laughter.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
(straightening up)
Shame on you, bringing a boy
upstairs with no one home. What
would your Father do if he knew?
He'd kill you!
WAJDA
Why are you home early, anyway?
Her Mother sits on her knees and faces Wajda, threateningly.
MOTHER
Listen to me, don’t ever bring him
up here again. I will seriously
tell his Uncle and he will be in
big trouble. If I weren't busy with
your Father's party, I would have
gotten really upset with you and we
would have a long talk about this.
(Switching moods suddenly)
Now let's get downstairs, we need
to start cooking. Your Father's
friends are coming over tonight.
And get your game out of there;
he'll be mad if he knows you are
using his TV.
Wajda looks up quickly at her Mother, surprised.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You think I don’t know your tricks?
At least you’re learning the Koran.
As they walk off the roof Wajda kicks a piece of ribbon that
had fallen off the bicycle. The ribbon flies in the air as
their figures disappear into the stairwell.
WAJDA (O.S.)
Are you going to tell his Uncle?
MOTHER (O.S.)
He is a nice boy. His only problem
is that you won't leave him alone.
(they both laugh) )
We'll cook the best dinner for your
Father's party tonight.

64.
93

INT. THE KITCHEN - EVENING

93

Wajda helps her Mother prepare the massive plates of food for
the group of men in the other room, talking and laughing
loudly. Trying to relieve the tension, she starts to SING.
MOTHER
Be quiet! Do you want them to hear
you? Put this in the oven.
Wajda stops singing and looks at her Mother, pushing back a
lock of hair off her forehead, looking exhausted.
Her Father KNOCKS once and they pass the plates through to
him at the door. He smiles as he takes it.
FATHER
Wow! All this food!
He kisses the Mother’s forehead and looks her in the eyes.
FATHER (CONT’D)
They'll be really impressed. You
make me so proud!
MOTHER
Obviously not proud enough.
She goes back to the kitchen and starts fixing the next dish.
94

INT. THE MAJLIS - LATER

94

Wajda and her Mother clean up dishes from a long sitting area
on the floor.
WAJDA
Wow! What is this?
Wajda examines a gift given to her Father. It is a family
tree. She runs her finger along the branches.
MOTHER
(cynically)
Your Father's glorious family tree.
Her Mother eats discarded food from the plates, then finds
her husband's prayer beads and picks them up tenderly.
Wajda leaves the family tree and hooks her game into the TV
as her Mother leaves the room.

65.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Make sure you clean that all up. I
don't want to do anything that will
get him upset with us again.
Distracted, Wajda puts down the controller and looks at the
family tree. The names read: “Khalid, Mansour, Mohammed,
Omar…” Her Father's name stands alone while all of his
brothers have leaves with boy's names below them. Wajda cuts
a piece of blank paper from the Koran, writes her name on it
and adds it under her Father's name.
MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I almost forgot. Ms. Hussa called
earlier.
Wajda looks at her, wide-eyed, while hooking up the game
controller. The Mother enters, smiling suspiciously.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
She's really pleased with you!
Honestly, the way Ms. Hussa was
going on I wasn't sure we were
talking about the same person!
She looks at Wajda expectantly, but Wajda shrugs, turns the
game on and busies herself with it. Her Mother stops cleaning
for a moment.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You keep surprising me!
95

INT. THE MOSQUE - DAY

95

All the girls crowd around Salma who passes around pictures.
The girls laugh and reach for them.
NOURA
Let me see! Let me see!
Are you wearing this only?
Noura covers her face in astonishment. The Teacher comes in
and Wajda pulls herself away from the scene. The other girls
don't notice. Noura points at a picture.
NOURA (CONT’D)
Is this your Father?
SALMA
(upset)
That's Khalid, my husband!

66.
NOURA
He looks like your grandfather. But
I guess that’s the best your family
could do-Humiliated, Salma snatches the photo back. All the girls
except Wajda laugh. The Koran Teacher appears behind,
catching them off guard.
KORAN TEACHER
What's going on here?
The girls immediately go silent.
WAJDA
(quickly)
I told them they can't have
pictures at school.
NOURA
No you didn't!
(turning to the teacher)
Salma just got married. Look, she
brought in pictures!
KORAN TEACHER
(grabbing the pictures)
Let me see. Who's this, your
Mother? Is this your husband?
As they talk, Wajda looks out to the hallway where Fatin and
Fatima pass by with their furious MOTHERS. Fatin tries to
explain something but her Mother silences her with an angry
look. Fatima notices Wajda watching sympathetically. Fatima
looks away.
KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Okay, put them away now. Wajda's
right, you're not allowed to show
pictures at school.
Wajda looks down, trying to hide being ashamed.
KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Let's get started. Yasmine, read
from page 13.
YASMINE
(whispering)
I need a Kleenex.
KORAN TEACHER
Wajda, read.

67.
Wajda closes her Koran and looks at the teacher hesitantly.
WAJDA
I'll try without looking.
The Koran Teacher looks at her, surprised.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
(reciting nervously)
And whoever opposes the Messenger
after guidance has become clear to
him and follows other than the way
of the believers - We will give him
what he has taken and drive him
into Hell, and evil it is as a
destination. Indeed, Allah does not
forgive association with Him, but
He forgives what is less than that
for whom He wills. They call upon
instead of Him none but female
[deities], and they call upon none
but a rebellious Satan.
KORAN TEACHER
Very nice Wajda, you remembered it
all. But you have to recite. You
can't just go..badababdababdaba!
(turns to Salma)
How about our young bride? Let's
hear that voice. And listen Wajda,
you have to recite like this if you
want to win.
SALMA
And whoever opposes the Messenger
after guidance has become clear to
him and follows other than the way
of the believers - We will give him
what he has taken and drive him
into Hell, and evil it is as a
destination...
The sweet sound echoes through the room, while the girls
follow along. Noura’s eyes stare at Salma through angry
slits. Wajda looks out at the empty hallway, disappointed.
96

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP - DAY

96

On her way home from school Wajda looks over and sees the
green bicycle in front, relieved that it’s still there. She
enters the shop.

68.
97

INT. THE TOY SHOP - DAY

97

WAJDA
Who were talking to yesterday about
the bicycle? I saw you showing it
to some kid when we drove by.
TOY SHOP OWNER
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
WAJDA
You know exactly what I’m talking
about. I don’t want you showing my
bicycle to anyone else.
He shakes his head. She reaches into her pocket.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
Here, I made you a mix-tape. Since
we are friends now.
TOY SHOP OWNER
(Sarcastically)
Thanks for your generosity.
WAJDA
(Sarcastically)
Don’t mention it.
my bicycle.
98

But don’t sell

EXT. FRONT OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY
Wajda walks past Abdullah by his Uncle's election tent,
without saying anything.
ABDULLAH
What, are you the one who is upset
with me now? Your Mother almost
broke my neck pushing me down the
stairs!
WAJDA
My Mother doesn’t want me talking
to you anymore.
She smiles and walks towards her house. He pulls out a
bicycle helmet and runs after her.
ABDULLAH
Since when do you listen to your
Mother? Here - I got you this. It's
a helmet, like the ones on TV.

98

69.
Wajda’s whole face lights up as she takes the helmet.
Abdullah is pleased.
ABDULLAH (CONT’D)
Do you want to ride in the empty
lot behind the tent? We have a few
minutes before people come.
99

EXT. THE CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

99

Wajda, wearing her abbayah and the helmet, rides in circles
in the empty lot. Abdullah sits on a cinder block, watching.
WAJDA
Watch this? See! See!
She takes her hands off the handlebars. He nods. She quickly
puts them back on but periodically takes them off while
riding.
ABDULLAH
The Toy shop owner told Khalid and
his Father that someone reserved
the bicycle.
Wajda’s Gets excited and hits the brakes hard.
WAJDA
He must be holding it for me!
100

INT. THE MAJLIS - DAY

100

Wajda sits playing her video game, wearing her helmet. A new
resolve in her eyes.
VIDEO GAME
What is Al Mihrab?
WAJDA
I know that one.
She hits the button.
Correct!
Finally!

VIDEO GAME
WAJDA

She falls back onto the couch. She looks up to see the family
tree. Her name has been taken off, and the leaf she wrote it
on is crumpled up on the table. She picks it up, sadly.

70.
Through the half open door she sees her Mother on the phone
in the other room, yelling.
MOTHER
Well if you won’t listen to me, I
don’t know why I should listen to
you!
Her Mother hangs up, puts on her abbayah and yells:
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Get ready, we are going out!
Wajda quickly takes off the bicycle helmet. The Mother puts
on her Abyya quickly. The new red shoes are left on the
floor.
101

INT. THE HOSPITAL - DAY

101

The Mother fidgets. At the far end of the room she sees
Leila, in a lab coat, putting files onto a shelf. She stands
on a ladder, wearing only a hijab, with her face and some
hair showing.
A SAUDI MAN puts a cup of coffee on the counter next to her.
They exchange jokes.
WAJDA
Are you going to work here with
Leila? Those lab coats are cool,
like the Matrix, only white!
MOTHER
Shhh! I… just want to give her
something.
Leila steps down and heads over.
LEILA
Hey! You came! Wait, let me get you
the application.
MOTHER
Leila, what happened? Why you are
you revealing your face?
Laila smiles to her confidently and searches under the desk,
her male colleague comes back. He smiles at the Mother.
MALE WORKER
Hello, How are you?

71.
She doesn't answer, uncomfortably tucking her hands into her
abbayah, looking away. Wajda looks at him casually.
Hello.

WAJDA

The man smiles to Wajda, grabs a file, and exits. The Mother,
now really uncomfortable, tries to get Leila's attention.
MOTHER
Leila, don't worry dear. I'm not
here for an application. We were
just passing by.
Wajda is surprised by her Mother's lie.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
We'll leave you now to work. Looks
like you're busy.
LEILA
(sympathetically)
It's a good job and the places are
filling up quickly. You should…
MOTHER
(interrupting)
It's so good to see you, Leila.
I'll call you later.
She grabs Wajda's hand and leads her towards the door. Wajda
looks back at Leila wistfully, then at her Mother.
WAJDA
I thought you were going to-Enough!

MOTHER

Her Mother shushes her and quickens her pace out the door.
102

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

102

The girls line up for an assembly. Ms. Hussa makes her way to
the stage and picks up the megaphone. She stares over the
crowd, sternly. She checks the microphone.
MS. HUSSA
Hello...Hello...In the name of God.
First I want to thank all the girls
for their hard work this term. We
are the best school in the area.
(MORE)

72.
MS. HUSSA (CONT'D)
And I would like to remind all the
girls that school is a place for
virtue and knowledge. (clears her
throat). Girls, I would like you to
listen very well. We caught two
girls committing a sin behind the
school. Their names are Fatin Ali
and Fatima Umar.
The girls stare intently as Ms. Hussa motions the “offenders”
forward.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
And now they will come to the front
of the stage to repent.
Fatin and Fatima make their way to the stage. They appear
broken, their heads hanging low and their faces blank. Wajda,
upon seeing the girls, feels sick to her stomach.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
To avoid similar situations, you
are no longer allowed to bring
flowers to school for your friends,
or give each other letters or
autographs. And no one is allowed
to hold hands. Do you understand?
Good. You may go to your classes
now.
The girls move quickly toward the door. As Fatin and Fatima
leave, Fatin bumps into a GIRL.
GIRL
(panicked, screaming)
Don't touch me!
Fatin says nothing. Wajda starts to walk toward them both
when she sees Ms. Hussa waiting by the stairs.
Wajda stops, glances at the two girls, then back at Ms. Hussa
who smiles at her. Wajda turns her head quickly and walks
away from Fatin and Fatima, feeling guilty and uncertain.
103

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

103

Wajda brings in her Koran and sits on the floor next to her
Mother who irons her Father's thobes, singing.
MOTHER
The handsome man stole my heart;
with his black eyes. I come closer,
he goes away;
(MORE)

73.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
making me feel hollow. No tears, no
words can bring him back; Oh my
heart..
Wajda ignores the piles of note-cards scattered around her,
looking morose. Her Mother looks at her, concerned, and stops
singing.
WAJDA
I don't want to finish the
competition! I hate Ms. Hussa! I'm
tired.
MOTHER
What does Ms. Hussa have to do with
it? It's your business!
(smiling encouragingly)
Your Father is happy that you are
doing this. He is so proud of you.
Please, Wajda. That’s very
important right now.
Wajda looks at her Mother, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. She
sits up straight and recites Surah 30 (Ar-Rum), verse 21:
WAJDA
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves, so
that you may find tranquility in
them; and He has put love and mercy
between you. Surely in this there
are indeed Signs for a people who
reflect.
Wajda stops reciting. Her Mother looks at her, lovingly.
MOTHER
Give it a tone like this.
(beautifully)
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves, so
that you may find tranquility in
them - Go on try it.
WAJDA
(imitating her Mother)
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves, so
that you may find tranquility in
them.
MOTHER
Very good! Now do the next lines
like this:

74.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
(reverently)

between you. Surely in this there
are indeed Signs for a people who
reflect.
WAJDA
(following)
And He has put love and mercy
between you. Surely in this there
are indeed Signs for a people who
reflect.
MOTHER
(proudly, teasing her)
Excellent! Your voice is as lovely
as your Mother's.
Wajda stops, realizing she’s doing it well!
WAJDA
I feel shy! I can't recite like
this in front of everyone.
MOTHER
You are shy? Ha! I only wish it
were true!
Wajda makes a face at her Mother, who bursts out laughing.
Wajda barely smiles.
Outside they see the lights Abdullah strung up turn on and
illuminate the street and their living room.
Wajda and her Mother look at each other.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
You’ve worked hard. Come on.
She quickly turns the iron off and they run up to the roof.
104

EXT. THE ROOF OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

104

The two look out as groups of men gather in the street below.
The lights reflect on Wajda and her Mother who look so much
alike in the dim light. A breeze blows their hair gently.
Down the street they see Abdullah's bearded Uncle greeting
everyone as they arrive.
Abdullah stands at the end of the row, dressed up in his
thobe and gutra. Wajda points down at her Father, excited.

75.
WAJDA
See! My Father is there.
MOTHER
(intrigued, searching)
Where?
WAJDA
(points down firmly)
There!
MOTHER
(excited)
Oh! I see him. Look how handsome he
is!
Wajda looks at her Mother from the corner of her eye. She is
busy looking at her Father. Wajda throws a little stone where
Abdullah stands and he looks up. He sees her without a veil
or head covering in the golden lights he himself strung up,
and smiles.
He fixes his gutra by throwing its ends on his shoulders, to
show how well dressed and important he is.
Wajda smiles back and gestures that there’s something on his
cheek. Abdullah looks worried and tries to clean his face.
Wajda laughs. Her Mother looks at her, disapprovingly.
Another man, standing next to Abdullah, looks up. Both Wajda
and her Mother duck behind the wall quickly, laughing softly.
Wajda's Mother lies down on the roof and stares at the stars
in the clear sky. Wajda lies next to her and smiles.
WAJDA
So do you love him?
MOTHER
(a little shy, surprised)
Who? Your Father?
WAJDA
(smiling, teasingly)
No, the neighbor's boy?
MOTHER
(also teasingly)
I don't think I am the one in love
with the neighbor's boy!
Wajda gets embarrassed, laughing dismissively at her Mother.

76.
Her Mother laughs. Wajda flips to her side and rests her head
on her arm in order to face her Mother.
WAJDA
You didn't answer!
MOTHER
I was in high school when he asked
for my hand. All the girls were so
jealous when they saw his picture.
He was the first man in my life,
and most probably the last! And I
have to admit, he's a lot of fun.
WAJDA
You are way prettier than any other
woman I have ever seen. You'll give
my Father a heart attack with your
red dress.
MOTHER
(suddenly sad)
Yeah. He won't see it. He'll be
busy in the men's section.
The man I know… he talks big, but
he would never burn my heart with a
second wife. I don't know who fills
his head with this nonsense.
She sits up, quickly, changing the subject.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
Enough. Let's practice one more
time for your competition tomorrow.
And don't tell anyone about that
crazy bicycle story of yours,
they'll never let you win.
Wajda makes a face, sits up, determined, and recites.
WAJDA
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves, so
that you may find tranquility in
them; and He has put love and mercy
between you.
MOTHER
(warmer inflection)
…Mercy between you...
WAJDA
…Mercy between you.

77.
MOTHER
Let it come from your heart, and
forget everyone around you.
She takes Wajda's hand and places it over her heart.
WAJDA
(more sincere)
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves, so
that you may find tranquility in
them; and He has put love and mercy
between you.
Her voice echoes across the empty roof while the election
lights sway in the breeze.
105

INT. WAJDA'S PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT

105

Wajda lies in her Father's place in the bed. Her Mother
sleeps next to her in a semi-fetal position. Wajda stretches
her arms in the vast empty space of the bed, occupying only a
small part of it.
106

INT. WAJDA'S PARENTS’ ROOM - DAY

106

Wajda now sleeps in a semi-fetal position. Her Mother wakes
her up, already dressed in her abbayah to leave for work. She
caresses Wajda's hair.
MOTHER
Now, you've got a big day today.
When you go up on the stage, say
this after me: God inspire me, make
things easier for me. Untie my
tongue so I speak fluently.
Wajda squints to see her Mother, struggling to remember.
WAJDA
Where are you going so early? God
inspire me, make things easier for
me..
MOTHER
(while fixing her veil)
I have to open up the school today.
I'm the teacher on duty… Untie my
tongue ...
Wajda yawns and runs her hand through her hair.

78.
WAJDA
...Untie my tongue...
MOTHER
...So I speak fluently
They hear a car HONKING at the door. Wajda touches the beads
on her Mother's abbayah.
WAJDA
...So I speak fluently.
Her Mother kisses her forehead and gets ready to leave.
MOTHER
I wish I could come today. You know
this damn long commute. I know
you'll nail it! And don't forget,
your Grandmother wants you to wear
the vest she made you for luck.
WAJDA
I hate that vest. I only ever wore
it that day I went to visit her.
MOTHER
I know you hate it, but do it for
her.
Wajda stares out into the hallway as her Mother pops her head
back into the doorway.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
And whatever happens, for
God's sake, act wise. No
bargaining, no fighting, and no
crazy ideas about bicycles. Watch
that tongue of yours. Understand?
She smiles and leaves. Her black shadow stretches across the
wall and then disappears. Wajda sighs and falls back onto the
bed. She reaches over and touches her Father's prayer beads
on the night-stand.
107

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

107

Wajda walks, whispering to herself the tajweed rule from a
note-card. She throws her Father’s rock at a bottle.
WAJDA
Man yajaala, Mayyjaal, edgham
beghunah.

79.
PING! The bottle spins. She smiles and walks on to school.
108

INT. THE TOY SHOP - DAY

108

The Owner puts on his glasses and looks skeptically down at a
tape labeled “Wajda’s Awesome Mix Tape Volume 8.” He puts it
in the player and presses “play.” A ROCK SONG starts. He
shakes his head disapprovingly, smiling.
109

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

109

Wajda and several other girls practice their recitations.
Wajda goes through her note cards, pulling pieces of paper
out of her pockets and scanning them. Ms. Hussa enters.
MS. HUSSA
Alright girls, make sure you empty
your pockets and leave all your
study material behind. No note
cards, no reasons of descendence,
no vocabulary cards. Alright?!
NOURA
Vocabulary? Reasons of
Descendence?! We were supposed to
know all of that?
Wajda empties her pockets, pulling out note cards and pieces
of paper. She takes out her Father's prayer beads and the
black rock. She notices Salma, sitting on a bench with her
hands tucked between her shaking knees, looking around
nervously. Ms. Hussa moves to leave.
MS. HUSSA
If we find any type of study
material on your person you will be
disqualified.
Wajda slowly walks over to Salma, bends down next to her,
holds out her rock and shows it to her.
WAJDA
With this rock I can’t lose.
SALMA
I'm not clean, I can't read the
Koran.
Wajda looks at her, perplexed. Overhearing, Noura approaches.

80.
SALMA (CONT’D)
(whispering)
You know…… after you sleep with
your husband… you have to wash
before you read the Koran.
Noura nods in agreement, hiding her excitement.
NOURA
If you feel nervous about it, maybe
you shouldn't do it.
(pause)
It's a lot of stress.
Salma gives Noura a hateful look. Ms. Hussa passes by, her
hands full of paper. Salma gets up and runs over to her. The
two speak quietly. Wajda watches them, slowly moving the rock
between her thumb and fingers as Ms. Hussa sends Salma out
the door.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

110

Wajda sits in a line with 7 girls and one empty chair, as the
following: Wajda, Contestant #2, Noura, Contestant #4,
Yasmine, Contestant #6, Contestant #7, and an empty chair.
She nervously shakes her leg, facing a table with the
teachers. Ms. Hussa writes "First Round" on a small
blackboard and heads back to her seat with the other teacher.
A fan turns slowly above them, rattling in the silent room.
MS. HUSSA
Welcome girls, we are very proud of
you for all of the work you have
put into this competition. Now,
let's start with vocabulary from
the verses you learned. If you get
the answer right, you stay in line.
If you get it wrong, please exit to
the right of the stage. Wajda,
please come forward. Who are the
Sabians?
Wajda tries to compose herself. She brushes the sweat off her
forehead and walks to the front of the stage.
WAJDA
They lived in Iraq. Their book is
the Zubar.
MS. HUSSA
Correct. Next. What is Ayat?

81.
The girl next to Wajda gets up and moves to the front.

CONTESTANT #4
MS. HUSSA
Next. What’s Al

YASMINE
A temptation.
Correct.

MS. HUSSA
Next. What’s sodgatehun?

The 6th Contestant thinks hard, unsure. Noura looks at her
happily, while Wajda looks at her compassionately, holding
the black stone.
CONTESTANT #6
Um… charity?
MS. HUSSA
Incorrect. What is sodgatehun?
Dowry.

CONTESTANT #7

MS. HUSSA
Excellent. Well done all of you.
And now-Just then, Ms. Jamila enters and whispers to her.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
She's ready? Good, send her in.

82.
Salma enters from behind the stage. Her hair is dripping wet
and she has obviously just showered. Red faced, and
mortified, she sits at the end of the line. Wajda glances at
her. Noura glares at Salma, furiously.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Salma, please come forward. What is
Al Farqan?
Salma moves to the front of the stage.
The Koran.

SALMA

MS. HUSSA
Excellent. Next. From the
beginning. Da'ab?

CONTESTANT #7
A big.....thing?
Ms. Hussa suppresses a smile. The girl stands nervously in
her spot.
MS. HUSSA
Also incorrect. What is “Hoban
Kibiran?
SALMA
Great Injustice.

83.
MS. HUSSA
Correct. Thank you.
Wajda looks at Ms. Hussa, trying to hide how nervous she is.
Only the three girls remain in the eight chairs.
Ms. Hussa confers with the other teacher and then stands up
and moves to the front of the room.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Those of you on the right of the
stage, please come and collect your
certificate of appreciation, thank
you for participating, I'm sure you
learned a lot. Noura, Salma, and
Wajda, congratulations, you're
going to compete for the
championship. Good luck.
111

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY (LATER)

111

Ms. Hussa stands under the words "Championship" on the
blackboard. Noura, Salma and Wajda sit at a table in front of
the stage.
Wajda looks petrified, while Noura smiles with contentment
and Salma stares ahead in quiet determination.
NOURA
(whispering to Wajda)
I’ll bet you never thought you’d
make it this far. But beware of
the ugly bride over there, she
looks pretty determined to win.
Especially after her shower.
Wajda turns away. Salma flashes Noura a look of intense anger
about to cry.
MS. HUSSA
Girls, we'll now have you recite.
Please read until we indicate for
you to stop. We’ll start with Surat
al Nisa, from ayat 66, Noura begin
with “If we had decreed”:
NOURA
(flatly but correct)
And if We had decreed upon them,
"Kill yourselves" or "Leave your
homes," they would not have done
it, except for a few of them.
(MORE)

84.
NOURA (CONT'D)
But if they had done what they were
instructed, it would have been
better for them and a firmer
position. And then We would have
given them from Us a great reward.
And We would have guided them to a
straight path. And whoever obeys
Allah and the Messenger - those
will be with the ones upon whom
Allah has bestowed favor of the
prophets, the steadfast affirmers
of truth, the martyrs and the
righteous. And excellent are those
as companions.
Ms. Hussa raises her hand for her to stop. Noura sits back
confidently. Ms. Hussa looks to Salma to begin.
MS. HUSSA
Salma start Surat al Bakara from
the beginning.
SALMA
(lowering her eyes)
In the name of Allah, the
Beneficent, the Merciful. Alif Lam
Mim. This Book, there is no doubt
in it, is a guide to those who
guard against evil.
Noura’s cold eyes distract her.
SALMA (CONT’D)
Those who believe in the unseen and
keep up prayer and spend out of
what We have given them. And who…
and who…
KORAN TEACHER
(giving her cues)
…And who believe...
SALMA
(shaken, continuing)
…Who believe in that which has been
revealed to you and that which was
revealed before you and… uh
KORAN TEACHER
…And they are sure of the
hereafter.

85.
SALMA
(more shaken, continuing)
…And they are sure of the
hereafter. These are on a…
Salma stops and looks up. Ms. Hussa raises her hand.
MS. HUSSA
That's enough. Thank you, Salma.
Let's continue.
Wajda removes her sweaty hand from the table, leaving a moist
imprint on it. She dries her hand on her dress.
She puts her hand in her pocket, pulls out her Father’s stone
and grips it tightly. A piece of paper sticks out of the
pocket on her vest. She looks at Salma, trying not to cry.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Let’s continue.
Wajda puts the stone back in her pocket and waits silently
for the teacher's instructions.
KORAN TEACHER
Wajda, please start with Surat al
Bakara, ayat 7. Starting with
“There is disease.”
Wajda looks uncertain, feeling small in the large room. She
steadies herself in a moment that drags on endlessly. In the
crowd she sees Fatin and Fatima looking directly at her. She
is about to lower her eyes but something in their now beaten
faces makes her find her confidence.
She meets their eyes right on and starts reciting in a
beautiful voice, which begins weak and then gradually grows
stronger and more intense.
WAJDA
In the name of Allah, the
Beneficent, the Merciful. There is
(pause)
There is… a disease in their
hearts, so Allah added to their
disease and they shall have a
painful chastisement because they
lied. And when it is said to them,
Do not make mischief in the land,
they say: We are but peace-makers.
Now surely they themselves are the
mischief makers, but they do not
perceive.

86.
Wajda stops and looks around the room for some indication on
whether or not she should continue.
MS. HUSSA
(softly)
Thank you, Wajda, that was very
good.
Noura looks worried and very angry. Fatima has a small smile
on her face. The two teachers lean in to consult each other.
The moment seems endless to Wajda.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Girls, you did an excellent job and
you should be proud you all made it
this far. Congratulations...we will
announce the winner after the
prayer.
Out of the corner of her eye she sees Noura, peering down at
Wajda's vest pocket. Wajda looks at her, confused, then down
at her pocket and sees the paper sticking out.
Noura’s mouth widens in a devilish grin as she sits straight
up in her chair.
Wajda blanches, pushes the paper down in to her pocket,
hiding it, then looks up quickly, panicking.
As the girls exit the stage Noura approaches the table where
the judges sit. She leans over to Ms. Hussa and whispers
something into her ear. Ms. Hussa furrows her brow, pauses
for a moment and looks at Wajda.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Wajda, please come over here.
Worried, Wajda walks over to the judges' table.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Empty your pockets.
Wajda stares at her.
WAJDA
I wasn't cheating, I swear!
NOURA
I saw a cheat-sheet in her pocket,
Ms. Hussa. You said that they were
to have no notes or else they’d be
disqualified.

87.
MS. HUSSA
Thank you, Noura, for your courage.
You may go now.
Noura shoots Wajda an evil smile.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Wajda, empty your pockets, please.
Wajda slowly pulls out the contents of her pockets, first the
rock, then her Father's prayer beads, and puts them on the
table. She pauses, looks down at her vest pocket, and
reluctantly pulls out the folded piece of paper. Not
remembering what it is, she looks at it with despair and lays
it on the table.
The Koran teacher takes the paper from the table and reads
it. Her face relaxes and she suppresses a smile. She hands it
to Ms. Hussa.
KORAN TEACHER
Ms. Hussa, someone loves you and
thinks you are like the moon! I
don't know if we agree with that!
She laughs teasingly to Ms. Hussa then looks to Wajda kindly.
KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
You know very well you shouldn't
bring notes like this to school,
not after the whole saga with Fatin
and Fatima.
Ms. Hussa takes the paper and looks at it, shocked. She looks
over to Wajda for answers. Wajda looks at her wide-eyed,
petrified to be caught with it.
MS. HUSSA
Thank you, Wajda. Please go join
the other girls for prayer.
She smiles and hands the note back to her.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
And when you return this note to
its illustrious author, I assume
you will do so with the benevolence
and graciousness your Koran
learning has taught you.
Wajda takes the note, turns away, still wide eyed, and inches
slowly away from the table. As she moves away from them her
look of fear and shock turns into a very broad grin.

88.
112

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

112

When she gets out into the hallway, alone, Wajda's smile
breaks into a giggle, until she bursts out into
uncontrollable fits of laughter.
113

INT. MOSQUE - DAY

113

The girls line up into rows. Some are taking out their
abbayahs and wrapping themselves for prayer.
Ms. Hussa is in the first row along with the other
contestants and a very angry Noura at her side.
Wajda sees Fatin and Fatima in the middle of the mosque and
lines up next them, smiling. She unfolds her abbayah and gets
ready to pray. Fatin looks over at her, raising her eyebrows.
FATIN
You sure you want to stand next to
us?
Fatima holds Fatin's arm, then looks gratefully at Wajda.
FATIMA
Congratulations.
WAJDA
They haven't announced the winner
yet.
FATIN
You won, and you're their favorite
convert, so I'm sure they were all
rooting for you anyway.
Wajda stares uncomfortably at the floor, unsure what to say.
WAJDA
I… I want to buy a bicycle. I'm
sorry, I had to win.
Fatin pushes Wajda away with her elbow. Fatima shakes her
head at Fatin and turns to Wajda.
FATIMA
A bicycle? You would never dare.
We all know that you’re a coward.
Wajda looks up to see Ms. Hussa searching for her.

89.
MS. HUSSA
Wajda! We saved you a spot in the
first row with the other
contestants.
Wajda looks back to Fatin and Fatima, fixing their abbayahs
for prayer. Wajda hesitates.
Go.

FATIMA

Fatin looks the other way but Fatima nods. Sadly, Wajda lines
up next to Ms. Hussa who grabs Wajda's abbayah and pulls her
next to her. She whispers down to her.
MS. HUSSA
Good Muslims have to line up close
to each other so the devil…
(indicates Fatin and
Fatima))
…doesn't get in between them.
Wajda avoids looking at Ms. Hussa as she lines up in her
spot. The call for the start of prayer is announced and all
of the girls pray in one synchronized voice.
GIRLS
Allhu Akbar.
114

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

114

Noura, Salma and Wajda wait nervously on stage. Ms. Hussa
reaches to a megaphone behind the blackboard.
MS. HUSSA
Standing in front of me are the
three finalists of the school-wide
Koran competition. Only one will be
awarded the cash prize, but all
will receive 1st, 2nd an 3rd place
certificates. The third place
winner is..Salma Andul Azziz.
Salma smiles to Wajda.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
And now, the runner up to this
year's competition is…
(pauses)
Noura Al Markoon.
Wajda covers her face, tearing up with happiness, the exact
opposite of Noura’s right now.

90.
Salma rushes up and gives Wajda an ecstatic congratulatory
hug. She scurries back to her seat and savors every second of
Noura, rigid and miserable, trudging up to Ms. Hussa, taking
her certificate and storming off the stage and out of the
room.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Wajda Al Safan, you are our
champion. Congratulations! You are
in this spot because of your
devotion and perseverance, and I
hope all the girls here today learn
from your example.
Wajda's face beams with happiness as she walks slowly to the
front of the stage. She nods "thank you" as Ms. Hussa hands
her the certificate. She looks nervously at the megaphone.
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
Alf Mabruk bint al Saffon. Don't be
shy! And what are your plans for
the prize money?
As Ms. Hussa hands her the megaphone, Wajda pauses and scans
the faces of the audience.
Mmmmm.

WAJDA

Ms. Hussa looks at Wajda and smiles encouragingly. Wajda's
gaze falls on Salma and the rest of the girls and then she
sees Fatin and Fatima, looking up at her - Fatin, with
contempt and Fatima with a glimmer of pride. Wajda takes a
big sigh and gathers her courage.
WAJDA (CONT’D)
(defiantly to Ms. Hussa)
I am going to buy a bicycle from
the shop down the road.
Giggles and laughter erupt from the audience.
What?

MS. HUSSA

Wajda looks at Fatin and Fatima, who both smile, impressed
with her statement. Wajda looks back at Ms. Hussa.
WAJDA
(matter-of-factly)
I'm buying a bicycle.
(pauses and smiles) )
With no training wheels, of course.

91.
Fatin and Fatima laugh, along with the rest of the crowd.
MS. HUSSA
(persuasively)
Now Wajda, wouldn't you rather
donate the money to our fighting
brothers in Palestine?
WAJDA
I don't think so. I'm going to buy
a bicycle.
Wajda looks at Ms. Hussa calmly and shrugs her shoulders. Ms.
Hussa stands, unsympathetically.
MS. HUSSA
A bicycle is not a toy for girls
Wajda. Especially Muslim girls who
need to protect their honor. Plus,
I'm sure your family won't allow
it. We will donate the money in
your name to our brothers and
sisters fighting in Palestine.
But--

WAJDA

MS. HUSSA
Thank you for your obedience and
generosity. You may step down now.
Wajda stares at Ms. Hussa, then looks over at the other
teachers cautiously, realizing their disapproval. She
continues staring at Ms. Hussa, knowing she cannot argue.
Distraught, she turns to leave, but Ms. Hussa stops her
MS. HUSSA (CONT’D)
(whispers)
You think you can act however you
want and people won't notice? This
will haunt you forever.
Wajda, infuriated, speaks very loudly.
WAJDA
You mean like your “handsome”
thief??
The crowd goes silent as does a shocked and humiliated Ms.
Hussa. Wajda marches down to join the crowd of girls leaving
the big hall - Fatin and Fatima right by her side. Fatima
messes up her hair and Wajda tries to smile, holding back
tears.

92.
115

EXT. FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

115

Abdullah waits outside as Wajda exits, sobbing. She storms
past him without pausing. He runs along after her, confused.
ABDULLAH
Didn't you win? Where is the money?
WAJDA
In Palestine!
She continues walking. He stands in disbelief for a few
seconds and then runs along after her. She is heartbroken
with tears in her eyes. She turns her head to hide them.
Abdullah retreats, taken aback by her vulnerability.
Wajda runs off, leaving him standing alone in the street.
116

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP

116

Wajda speeds up as she nears the toy shop. She breaks into a
run as she sees that the bicycle is no longer there. She
looks up to the Toy Shop Owner, unloading boxes from a truck.
He glances over at her and shrugs his shoulders.
I had to.

TOY SHOP OWNER

Wajda storms off angrily, crying fresh tears.
Abdullah, standing at the corner, stares at the empty spot in
front where the bicycle once sat.
117

EXT. THE CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

117

Wajda trudges slowly, defeated, trying not to cry. The
workers taunt Wajda as she approaches, making rude gestures.
WORKER
Come up and play with us little
girl. We will have lots of fun!
Wajda stops, breathing heavily. Determined, she scoops up
handfuls of stones and throws them violently at the workers,
who run for cover. She cries.
WAJDA
Take this! Take this!

93.
Abdullah catches up, sees what’s going on, scoops up a
handful of rocks and joins in, aiming for the workers. The
FOREMAN approaches them menacingly, shaking his fist.
FOREMAN
Hey you kids! Stop that!
ABDULLAH
(holding up a big stone)
Tell your workers to stop bothering
her. She deserves better!
His arm still outstretched, he looks at Wajda who drops her
remaining stones, turns and runs back towards her home.
118

EXT. FRONT OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - DAY

118

Wajda and Abdullah walk slowly back towards the house.
ABDULLAH
(softly)
I'll give you my bicycle.
WAJDA
(shaking her head)
Then how would we race?
Wajda walks on ahead of Abdullah.
ABDULLAH
Hey, Wajda!
She turns.
ABDULLAH (CONT’D)
(gathering up his courage)
You know I'll marry you when we
grow up, right?
Wajda stops and looks at him sadly. She turns away and
continues towards her home.
119

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

119

Wajda pushes open the front door of her house, surprised to
see it’s unlocked. She walks in, tired.
Her Father sits on the edge of the couch, nervously twiddling
his thumbs. He runs his hands through his freshly combed hair
when he sees Wajda.

94.
FATHER
Hey, finally you're home!
Wajda looks at her Father, suspiciously.
WAJDA
(pretending to be cheerful)
What's up with the new hairstyle?
FATHER
Your Mother’s rejecting my calls.
I've been trying to call her all
day. Where is she?
Wajda, without saying anything, pulls the certificate from
the competition out of her bag, walks slowly over to her
Father and hands it to him.
He looks at her, confused, and reads it. His face changes to
excitement.
FATHER (CONT’D)
You won? I can't believe it.
That's amazing!
He hugs her. Wajda rests her head on his shoulder and lets a
few tears flow from her eyes. He holds her in front of him.
FATHER (CONT’D)
Hey, why are you crying? You won.
You should be happy?
Wajda is about to tell him everything when his phone RINGS.
He goes to the hallway to talk in private. He turns away from
Wajda, laughs, says something soft and hangs up. He returns
to the Majlis and picks up his ghutra and Okal.
As he leaves, he messes up her hair playfully.
FATHER (CONT’D)
I'm so proud of you, my little
champ.
He looks back at her.
FATHER (CONT’D)
Tell your Mother I waited for her.
I wanted to talk with her. Tell
her…
(clears his throat)
Tell her I love her.

95.
He turns back once more, giving Wajda an apologetic smile and
leaves. Wajda sits back into the couch. She looks up at the
clock on the wall. The phone RINGS and she picks up.
WAJDA
Hello? Hi Aunt Leila… No, I don't
know where she is… Yeah, she's
usually home by now… Okay, I'll let
her know. Bye.
She lays down and continues staring at the ticking clock.
120

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

120

Wajda sleeps on the couch, still in her school uniform. She’s
awakened by the sound of GUNSHOTS and BLASTS of fireworks in
the distance. She sits up and sees that the living room is
dark. Lights are shining from the bathroom and her Mother's
room. She gets up and cautiously walks over.
She looks in through the doorway and sees her Mother's
abbayah on the bed right next to:
A NEW WHITE LAB COAT.
She heads for the bathroom.
121

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

121

Wajda leans over the sink to wash her face. She sees clumps
of freshly cut hair along the inside of the sink. As she
examines it closer, she hears more GUNSHOTS and BLASTS of
fireworks. She looks at the stairway leading to the roof.
122

EXT. THE ROOF OF WAJDA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

122

Wajda sees her Mother smoking a cigarette in the dim light.
Her hair is cut to shoulder length, twirling in the wind. She
stares off into the distance, at a party, where strands of
lights line a house a few blocks away.
Wajda walks over and stands next to her Mother, tossing her
Father’s rock idly in her hand. Her Mother tries to
discretely put out her cigarette. Wajda stares out at the
house with the lights on it, confused. The Mother smiles
sadly.
MOTHER
I heard the news. Congratulations,
I'm so proud of you.

96.
WAJDA
(pouting)
They didn't give me the money.
She puts the rock back in her pocket. The Mother messes up
Wajda's hair, playfully.
MOTHER
I can't believe you said you wanted
a bicycle!
(laughing) )
They must have thought you were
crazy!
(pauses)
Damn them, you don't need their
money, anyway.
Wajda is taken aback by her Mother's tone. She watches her
skeptically as she squints off towards the house having the
party.
WAJDA
Isn't that my Grandmother's house?
I thought my Uncle's wedding wasn't
until next month. Right?
MOTHER
It's not your Uncle's wedding they
are celebrating.
Wajda looks up at her Mother suddenly. Her eyes widen in
realization. Wajda rushes over to hug her, and they embrace.
Her Mother sits them down and wraps her arms around Wajda's
head and shoulders as GUNSHOTS ring out in the distance. Her
Mother wipes the tears from Wajda's eyes.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
It's all right. He made his
decision. It'll be only the two of
us now. It will be fine.
She strokes her daughter’s hair. Wajda looks up, determined.
WAJDA
Let's buy the red dress and go over
there and get him!
MOTHER
There's no need for the red dress
anymore. Besides, I used that money
to buy you something else.

97.
She reaches over and flicks on the bare light-bulb on the
wall.
The weak light falls directly on the corner of the roof
revealing…
THE GREEN BICYCLE!
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I wanted to surprise you tomorrow
morning.
Wajda stares at it in disbelief then looks over to her
Mother, who smiles at her tenderly.
MOTHER (CONT’D)
I hope it’s the right one. The
Shopkeeper said he has been holding
it for some spunky little girl for
weeks.
They embrace each other and cry as fireworks continue behind
them.
123

EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

123

Wajda pedals through the neighborhood on her new green
bicycle. The wind blows through her hair. She slides to a
stop in front of her Grandmother’s house. She looks up at the
lights and remaining decorations. She sighs and continues on.
As she pulls away she sees Abdullah approach with a few other
boys. She smiles at him. He smiles back, waves the others to
go on without him and pushes hard to catch up with her.
As they pass the toy shop, The Owner sits sipping tea in
front of the store chatting with another FRIEND.
FRIEND
What is this music?
As the children pass by, The Owner smiles at Wajda. His
friend looks at him in utter confusion.
Wajda turns and pushes her bicycle ahead faster. She looks
back to see if Abdullah is catching up to her.
WAJDA
Catch me if you can!
She passes by several BYSTANDERS who look at her
disapprovingly. She holds out her arms proudly and steers the
bicycle without touching the handlebars, smiling.

98.
Wajda breaks away and pedals until she reaches the end of the
road, where the highway begins. She slides to a stop, looks
back and smiles to see Abdullah catching up to her, then she
turns and stands watching the trucks and cars rumble by.
FADE OUT:
