INT. KLIMT’S STUDIO, VIENNA. DAY. 1907
During the credits we watch the creation of a masterpiece:
GUSTAV KLIMT painting ADELE BLOCH-BAUER, his magnetic muse.
Klimt has a larger than life, sexual presence, and there is
something almost erotic about the way he paints his model,
which the sensual Adele is more than aware of. As his rough
hands apply gold-leaf to the canvas, Adele shuffles in her
seat. Klimt speaks in German - marked in italics, as it is
throughout the script.

KLIMT
Move to the left a little.

KLIMT (CONT’D)
Rück ein wenig nach links

She does so.
ADELE
Like this?

ADELE (CONT’D)
So? Oder so?

He walks up to her, touches her just beneath the shoulder,
adjusts the angle she is sitting at, then returns to his
canvas. As he moves away, she shuffles again.

KLIMT
You are restless today.

KLIMT (CONT’D)
Du bist unruhig heute.

ADELE
I worry too much, you know
that.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Ich mache mir zu viele
Sorgen, das weisst du.

KLIMT

KLIMT (CONT’D)
Worüber?

ADELE

ADELE (CONT’D)
Die Zukunft.

About what?

The future.

EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE, VIENNA. DAY. 1938
The Bloch-Bauer residence on Elizabethstrasse. HEINRICH and
KLAUS, two soldiers in Nazi uniform, stand outside it and
start pounding loudly on the front doors. Standing behind
them in civilian clothes is the Gestapo agent, FELIX LANDAU.
HEINRICH
Open the door!

HEINRICH (CONT’D)
Öffnen Sie die Tür!

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET. DAY.
Superimposed caption : LOS ANGELES, 1999
A car drives down a Los Angeles street and passes by a small
knitwear boutique - this little shop looks very European,
small and quaint - quite incongruous in the West Hollywood
surroundings.

2

INT. MARIA’S BOUTIQUE. DAY.
The phone is ringing in Maria’s knitwear boutique, as MARIA
is handing a purple cardigan over to a customer. Maria is an
elderly, beautiful woman who oozes old world charm and
elegance. Behind her chic ensembles and delicate manner
however there is a fair amount of steel as well as an
anarchic streak. Her customer is LIZBET, another elderly
woman of European provenance.
MARIA
When I saw this one I decided it
had your name on it.
Lizbet tries on the cardigan.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Purple is definitely your colour. I
don’t know why it’s taken you sixty
years to discover it.
The phone keeps ringing; Maria excuses herself with a smile
and answers it.
MARIA (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
Hello? Yes, my dear, it is. I see.
Yes, of course. Thank you for
letting me know.
She puts down the receiver. And in her face we see that she
has just received some life-changing news. Lizbet notices.
LIZBET
Are you alright Maria?
And when Maria utters her sister’s name, it is to herself.
MARIA
Luise.
EXT. A CEMETERY. DAY.
A Jewish cemetery on a sunny afternoon, an oasis of calm
against the Los Angeles skyline. People huddled around
LUISE’S coffin as Maria makes a short speech. She looks
dignified in an unostentatious suit.
MARIA
My sister and I loved each other
but the truth is that we were
always competing. If life is a
race, then she has beaten me to the
finishing line. But if it is a
boxing match, then I’m the last one
standing.
A ripple of laughter from those who knew them both. With a
spade, Maria throws some earth into the grave. And when she
speaks again, it is quietly, looking down at her sister’s
coffin.

3

MARIA (CONT’D)
Either way, we went through a lot
together, and I will miss you. Auf
wiedersehen, Liebe Schwester.
EXT. A CEMETERY. DAY. LATER
As the mourners make their way to the waiting limos in the
late afternoon sun, Maria is accompanied by BARBARA
SCHOENBERG, an old family friend. Barbara is in her sixties;
an academic who is intelligent and warm.
MARIA
Thank you for coming, Barbara, to
have you here means a lot.
BARBARA
Our families go back a long way.
How are you coping?
MARIA
I’m getting used to losing the
people I love. Practice makes
perfect, my dear.
And that reminds her of a job that needs doing.
Barbara.

MARIA (CONT’D)
Your son, the lawyer..
BARBARA

Randy?
MARIA
Last time I saw him he was wearing
braces and reading a Spiderman
comic. How is he?
BARBARA
Struggling, I’m afraid.
Maria looks at her, uncomprehending.
BARBARA (CONT’D)
After law school he worked at a
fancy firm for four years, then
decided to set out on his own in
Pasadena.
MARIA
So what happened?
BARBARA
It all fell apart. Add those debts
to seven years of student loans and
things aren’t great.
MARIA
I’m sorry to hear it.
They’ve reached the cars. A chauffeur opens the door for
Maria.

4

BARBARA
Good news is he has an interview
coming up with a firm downtown.
Something solid.
MARIA
Well, that sounds promising.
The two women kiss and Maria gets into the car.
BARBARA
You need a lawyer?
MARIA
Some letters I found in my sister’s
belongings. I need advice from
someone I can trust.
EXT. A LOS ANGELES ROAD. DAY.
RANDY is driving his tired car a little erratically along an
LA road, obviously late. RANDY is in his thirties, eager,
with a rough charm . But there is also something a little
chaotic and immature about him, as if he is still searching
for his centre.
INT. CAR. DAY
Randy has his hands on the steering wheel and is sipping
coffee from a paper cup as he rehearses for the upcoming
interview.
RANDY
And I really feel that with a firm
like yours..and I really feel, sir,
that with a firm of this
reputation...
His cell phone - very much of the period - rings on the
passenger seat next to him. He picks it up, placing the cup
between his thighs.
RANDY (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
Hello?
BARBARA (O.S.)
Randy, do you remember Maria
Altmann? She has something she
wants to ask you.
RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
Not a good time, Mom, not a good
time. I’ll call you later.
He switches it off, puts it back, and aims for his cup. But
he drops it, pouring steaming coffee on his crotch.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Shit!

5

EXT. BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN OFFICES. DAY.
Randy is racing towards the impressive glass and steel
building that houses the Bergen Brown Sherman Law Firm. He’s
running late, has to weave his way through impressive young
lawyers on their way to work.
INT. ELEVATOR, BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN. DAY.
And in the elevator of the law firm building, he is still
rehearsing under his breath.
RANDY
I sincerely feel that with a firm
of this standing, no, with a firm
of this calibre..
There’s a high-powered looking lawyer wearing an impressive
suit in the lift - he throws Randy a funny, slightly
supercilious look and then spots the coffee stain on the
crotch.
RANDY.
It’s coffee. Soya cappuccino.
INT. BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN BOARDROOM. DAY
In the impressive glass and steel offices, Randy is now being
interviewed by the partners that make up BERGEN, BROWN and
SHERMAN, all in their sixties. They sit on one side of the
boardroom table and on the other sits Randy, who is
delivering his rehearsed spiel with nervy gusto.
RANDY
With a firm as impressive as this,
I would be strongly motivated to
deliver my very best.
SHERMAN has an open folder before him which contains Randy’s
CV : the name SCHOENBERG in bold letters at the top.
SHERMAN
Any relation to the famous
composer?
Randy is a little put out by the question. One senses he gets
this all the time. But he does his best to cover the
instinctive response.
RANDY
Arnold was my grandfather, sir.
SHERMAN
His music demands a certain quality
of application but the rewards
validate the effort.
BROWN
A radical.

6

RANDY
One of the things I would most look
forward to is dealing with..
But he’s interrupted.
SHERMAN
And Judge Schoenberg is your
father.
RANDY
Retired now, but yes sir, he is.
SHERMAN
Outstanding lineage Mr. Schoenberg.
RANDY
Yes, sir.
He gives up, smiles, just a little defeated. It’s not as if
he’s not used to living in these shadows.
SHERMAN
So what happened in Pasadena?
Randy is flummoxed by the question. For a second he
flounders, then opts for honesty.
RANDY
I took a risk and it didn’t pay
off. Working for yourself isn’t
everything it’s hyped up to be.
SHERMAN
So now you’re ready to work with
others.
And all Randy can muster is a smile. But Sherman decides to
give him a chance. He closes the file.
SHERMAN (CONT’D)
Let’s give it a go, Mr. Schoenberg.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
In the slightly scruffy back garden of the house Randy shares
with his wife PAM and baby daughter DORA in the San Fernando
Valley, Pam and Randy are drinking champagne. Pam is holding
the glasses in one hand, balancing Dora in the other. Randy
puts on a mock patrician voice, sending the whole thing up a
little.
RANDY
Here’s to Bergen, Brown, Sherman,
and being able to tell them apart.
PAM
I’m so proud of you. And I was
thinking..
RANDY
Uh-oh.

7

She gives him a playful kick in the shins. He feigns pain.
PAM
We could get out of here, put a
down payment on one of those houses
we saw in Brentwood. I mean, not
now, but soon.
RANDY
Oh my God, I’ve just come from the
interview and she’s already calling
the moving company.
PAM
It’s the first time we can start
making plans.
RANDY
What is it you don’t like about
this place? The leaking taps, the
rogue mice, or the psychotic
neighbour?
PAM
All of the above. And we could get
somewhere with a little room I
could turn into a studio.
RANDY
Sounds pretty good.
She kisses him, turns to go into the house.
PAM
I’m putting her to bed and then
we’ll have dinner. Couscous.
She turns and behind her back he makes a face - he’s
obviously not a fan of couscous.
RANDY
That’s great. I’m going to run out
but I’ll be back by eight, eight
thirty at the latest.
PAM
Where are you going?
RANDY
My Mom’s been driving me crazy.
Some family friend woman. I need to
get it out of the way.
She kisses him.
PAM
Okay. Hurry home.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS STREET. DAY.
Randy is driving towards Maria’s house, looking a little
stressed as he mutters to himself.

8

RANDY
Thanks, Mom.
EXT. MARIA’S FRONT YARD. DUSK.
In the early evening, Randy pulls up in front of Maria’s
little bungalow. He gets out of the car to find her watering
her plants.
MARIA
I was expecting you at six. It’s
ten past.
RANDY
My apologies, Mrs. Altmann, it was
gridlock on Wilshire.
And it’s lovely to see you too.
As he shakes her hand the sarcasm can’t help but seep through
his smile. Maria starts to make her way towards the front
door; he follows.
MARIA
You look tired and stressed
you’re not bad looking.

but

RANDY
Thank you.
MARIA
Do you know anything about art
restitution?
RANDY
Not a thing.
MARIA
Well, it’s never too late to learn.
Come in and have some strudel. I
made it especially for you.
And as they enter the house, Randy throws a quick glance at
his watch. He really doesn’t have the time for this.
INT. MARIA’S LIVING ROOM. DUSK.
Randy is walking around Maria’s living room, taking it all
in. It’s as if a small part of pre-war Vienna has been
transported to the suburbs of L.A. He’s looking at an old
family picture on the wall from the 1920s when Maria
approaches with a slice of strudel for him.
MARIA
My sister is the pretty one on the
right.

9

INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DUSK.
The photo comes to life: it is the 1920’s and the BlochBauers are posing for the photographer: CHILD MARIA and her
sister CHILD LUISE, GUSTAV and THERESE, their parents,
FERDINAND and ADELE, their uncle and aunt. As each one is
mentioned, we see them in close-up as they prepare to have
their photograph taken.
MARIA (V.O.)
I’m the moody one in the middle. My
parents, my uncle Ferdinand, and
my aunt Adele.
ADELE
Come and sit next to me,
Maria, darling.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Komm, setz dich neben mich,
Maria, Liebling.

MARIA (V.O.)
Adele did not have children, we
were like one big family ; I had
two sets of parents.
GUSTAV
Try to smile Maria, it’s
good to exercise your facial
muscles at least once a year!

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Versuche wenigstens einmal im
Jahr zu lächeln Maria, es ist
eine gute Übung für deine
Gesichtsmuskeln!

They all laugh and there’s a flash as the photo is taken.
MARIA (V.O.)
The Bloch-Bauers.
RANDY (V.O.)
The famous Bloch-Bauers.
INT. MARIA’S LIVING ROOM. DUSK.
And now they’re sitting and he’s finished the cake, puts the
plate down. Maria hands him a big bundle of letters, tied
with a string. He is polite but it’s not easy, he doesn’t
want to be here.
MARIA
I found these amongst my sister’s
belongings. I’ve translated them
for you on the back.
He starts to scan them, notices the date.
RANDY
1948.
MARIA
From our family lawyer in Vienna,
Johann Rinesch. All about our
paintings which were stolen by the
Nazis.

10

RANDY
Okay.
MARIA
A month ago I read in the New York
Times that things are changing in
Austria.
RANDY
How are they changing?
MARIA
They’re redrafting the art
restitution laws. Reviewing old
cases.
INT. MARIA’S DINING ROOM. DUSK.
The dining room basks in late afternoon light as Maria opens
the sliding doors to it, and it’s madness - all of her
sister’s belongings take up the whole room, books and boxes
piled high on the floor and on the table. Randy follows her
into the room.
MARIA
My sister finally moves in with me.
Only problem is she decides to do
it when she’s dead.
RANDY
Well, at least you won’t be having
any arguments that way.
She gives him a look. He flounders, keeps digging.
RANDY (CONT’D)
What I mean is..you know how housemates argue, like about leaving
dishes in the sink and stuff like
that.
She gives him nothing. Randy digs some more.
RANDY (CONT’D)
So you won’t be arguing. About
dishes. Is what I mean. Coz she’s
dead.
It’s agony. He’s reached the end. No more space to dig.
RANDY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. That was..it was a joke.
Well, it was supposed to be a joke.
She holds it for a beat.
MARIA
I’m glad you went for law and not
stand-up comedy.
RANDY
You’re not alone there.

11

She reaches for a box, opens it, takes out a faded old
postcard of the Klimt portrait of Adele, hands it to him.
MARIA
Here she is - my Aunt Adele,
painted by Gustav Klimt.
RANDY
That’s quite a painting.
MARIA
It’s magnificent. She was taken off
the wall of our home by the Nazis.
Since then, she has been hanging in
the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna.
RANDY
And now you want to be reunited.
MARIA
Wouldn’t that be lovely?
RANDY
It would make you a rich woman, I’m
sure.
MARIA
And you think that’s what it’s
about, do you?
Randy is slightly taken aback and admonished. With her hand
she indicates the many boxes that lay piled and scattered
across the room: a family’s history. She picks up an old book
- a copy of the famous children’s stories Struwwelpeter - and
runs her hand across the cover. He notices the book.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I have to do what I can to keep the
memories alive. Because people
forget, you know. And then, there’s
justice.
And he catches something in her eyes - the memory of a longlost past and a long-forgotten wrong.
EXT. MARIA’S GARDEN. NIGHT.
Under the warm Californian night, Maria and Randy are sitting
in her garden. Randy is holding the postcard of Adele now;
Maria is holding the letters.
MARIA
After the war they returned a
couple of paintings to us which
paid for my nephew’s education. But
we had to sign export permits to
relinquish any claims to the five
Klimts including that portrait of
my aunt.
RANDY
Export permits?

12

MARIA
The Klimts were deemed national
treasures so we weren’t allowed to
take them out of the country even
though they belonged to us. So we
signed them over.
RANDY
Just like that?
MARIA
We didn’t have the strength to
fight, we were just grateful to be
alive. All we wanted to do was
mourn our dead. And there was
another important reason we didn’t
contest it.
RANDY
What was that?
MARIA
We were told that Adele had left
the paintings to the Belvedere in
her will.
RANDY
Had she?
MARIA
We always thought so. Then I read
these letters.
And she puts them on the table. Randy picks them up, but once
again he throws a quick look at his watch.
EXT. MARIA’S FRONT YARD. NIGHT.
A few minutes later, Maria is walking Randy back to his car.
When they get there, she decides to give her verdict.
MARIA
I am sorry to have wasted your
time. It was a test and we have
both failed.
He looks at her, doesn’t know what she means.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I have bored you to tears. Four
times you looked at your watch
tonight.
RANDY
I got a new job today. I have a
baby that keeps me up at night, a
wife I want to make happy, several
financial institutions who’d like
my feet broken, and a plate of
couscous waiting at home.

13

MARIA
So why would you be interested in
ancient history?
She takes the letters from his hand.
MARIA (CONT’D)
It’s great about the new job. And I
hope you succeed in making your
wife happy. Enjoy your couscous, my
dear.
He is about to get into the car, then stops.
RANDY
Struwwelpeter.
She doesn’t understand.
RANDY (CONT’D)
That book you were holding. My
grandmother used to read those
stories to me. Terrifying. The one
with the boy who got swept away by
the wind...
MARIA
Into a terrible adventure. I too,
found it frightening.
Something small happens; she returns the letters to him.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Just have a look and tell me if I
have a case. That’s all I want from
you.

INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT.
Randy and Pam’s bedroom, like the rest of their house, is
small and too crowded; it’s obvious they’ve outgrown it.
Randy is lying in bed next to PAM, looking through the
letters.
PAM
Read that one to me.
RANDY
‘11th of April, 1948. Dear Luise
Bloch-Bauer,’ - that’s her sister ‘the Austrian Government has
decided to return to you two of the
paintings which were unlawfully
taken from your family during Nazi
occupation.’

14

INT. MARIA’S BUNGALOW. NIGHT.
Maria goes from room to room, switching off the lights one by
one before she goes to bed. As the portrait of Adele is
mentioned we hover a little on the postcard of it which Maria
has placed leaning against some books in the dining room.
RANDY (V.O.)
‘This however comes with the full
understanding that they will hold
on to the Klimt portrait of your
aunt and the other four Klimts
which they insist were bequeathed
to the gallery in her will, a fact
which they claim as incontestible.’
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT.
And as Randy reads the last sentence, his interest has grown.
RANDY
‘The will itself, I have not seen,
despite my persistent attempts to
do so. Yours sincerely, Johann
Rinesch’.
And he puts down the letter, looks over at Pam.
PAM
So her lawyer never saw the will?
RANDY
Nobody saw the will. Can you
believe that? Nobody.
PAM
Nobody?
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
In his pyjamas, in amongst Dora’s toys, Randy is on the
internet, researching the web page of the ‘Austrian
Government, Ministry of Culture: Art Restitution claims.’ And
as his eyes scan the page we can tell he’s already being
drawn in a little.
INT. BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN OFFICES. DAY.
Randy comes out of his office, into the reception area and
sees Maria. He’s holding a bunch of papers. Maria is sitting,
but stands when he approaches. Randy’s behaviour is a little
furtive, as if he doesn’t want to be seen with Maria.
MARIA
Everybody here looks like they are
about to have nervous breakdowns.
RANDY
Most of them are. We need to
photocopy these.

15

Through a glass partition he notices Sherman looking at him,
wondering who Maria is. Feeling the pressure, Randy starts to
walk down the corridor to where the photocopier is, with
Maria in tow. He is obviously in a hurry, fitting Maria in
between pressing work at the office.
RANDY (CONT’D)
I was up till three, I did some
research for you.
MARIA
I’m impressed.
RANDY
Get someone on the ground in
Vienna. For the first time in fifty
years, they’ve opened the archives.
So you start by trying to find a
copy of Adele’s will.
They have arrived at the photocopier. He starts to make
copies for her.
MARIA
And then what?
RANDY
The Austrian Ministry of Culture
has set up a committee to review
each case individually. You need to
fill in an application for them to
consider your claim by the end of
next month at the latest.
MARIA
Next month?
He hands her a piece of paper - she scans it with her eyes.
RANDY
I’ve sent away for one already.
MARIA
Slow down, you’re going too quickly
for me. You can explain things to
me over lunch.
And just then, he sees Sherman again, coming out of a
conference room.
RANDY
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can’t do
lunch. I can’t do lunch, Maria.
INT. NORM’S DINER. DAY.
They’ve had lunch. Randy has placed the photocopied papers on
the table, amidst the leftovers.
RANDY
These are three names of the top
restitution lawyers in America.
(MORE)

16
RANDY (CONT'D)
They’ll cost you but without them,
it’s a non-starter.

MARIA
All I have is my bungalow, my shop,
and a little money I’ve been saving
for a trip to Hawaii. I don’t want
to start throwing cash at some
fancy lawyers.
He hands her the photocopies across the table, starts to put
on his jacket.
RANDY
I need to go.
MARIA
Randy, I don’t want to rock your
boat.
RANDY
Well, thank you, how considerate.
MARIA
But maybe you can help me on the
side. Like a hobby.
He makes a sign at the waitress for the check.
RANDY
You can’t do this ‘on the side’
Maria, this is a full time job,
this is not a hobby.
MARIA
You are quite rude, a little
uncouth, and completely
disinterested in the past.
RANDY
And you have a talent for making me
feel good about myself.
MARIA
But you have the connection.
RANDY
The connection?
MARIA
Your family, Randy. Your
grandparents. They were from
Vienna. We have the same history.
And to this he has no answer.
INT. RANDY’S OFFICE. DAY.
Back on his computer that afternoon, Randy closes a work page
and starts looking for info on the actual painting, finds a
piece about it, and his eyes fall on a sentence about its
estimated value.

17

With him we read the words : “estimated value is over a
hundred million dollars”. We watch his reaction at this piece
of information.
EXT. LOS ANGELES PARK. DAY.
Randy and Pam are having an evening stroll in a local park.
Randy has DORA, their baby daughter, strapped to him. As
Randy talks to her about this change of heart, he tries to
appear casual, nonchalant - a performance to keep her on his
side.
RANDY
I can help her find the will, get
the ball rolling, then hand the
whole thing over to someone else.
PAM
You mean you’re going to go all the
way to Austria?
RANDY
So all I need to do is get the firm
interested.
PAM
You sure that’s a good idea? You’ve
only just started the job, how do
you think they’ll react if you run
off?
RANDY
I’m not going to run off, honey, I
just want to persuade them to let
me go. It’s not a big deal.
PAM
Besides, you think the Austrians
will make it that easy for you?
‘Here’s the files and a pastry’?
RANDY
Nothing to lose.
PAM
Isn’t there?
And her question hovers in the air.
INT. SHERMAN’S OFFICE. DAY.
Randy sits in Sherman’s impressive office. He’s handed
Sherman a folder which Sherman is scanning his eyes over.
SHERMAN
I can’t have you in Austria chasing
paintings, Randy.
RANDY
Not just any paintings sir.

18

SHERMAN
I know them well. Our daughter went
to Vienna and all we got was the
lousy fridge-magnets.
RANDY
I see it as a possible investment
for the firm.
SHERMAN
Go on.
RANDY
It’s all in there, sir. There seems
to be a move in Austria towards
making reparations for the past.
And these paintings are priceless.
I’d be..we’d be representing Mrs.
Altmann.
SHERMAN
You really think a painting that
ends up as a fridge-magnet will
ever leave Austria?
RANDY
I think it would be a mistake not
to take a look.
For a second Sherman could go either way.
SHERMAN
One week max, I want you back on
the 3rd.
RANDY
Thank you, sir!
INT. MARIA’S BOUTIQUE. DAY
Early evening and Maria has just received a new shipment of
sweaters at her small boutique. She is taking them out of the
containers, placing them carefully onto the shelves. Randy
bursts in from the street. She works throughout the scene.
RANDY
Still working.
MARIA
I’ll close the shop only when I
croak.
RANDY
I’ve got the green light - I’ll go
over, try and find the will. Then
we take it from there.
She is thrilled.
MARIA
You are chomping at the bite all
of a sudden!

19

RANDY
The bit, yes. And I’ve got another
idea...
He puts a copy of an Austrian newspaper, the Wiener Zeitung,
on the counter where she’s folding the sweaters. Points to an
article. The sight of the Austrian paper unnerves her.
RANDY (CONT’D)
My mother sent me this. There’s an
art restitution conference planned
later this month. They’re looking
for speakers. I think you should be
one of them.
MARIA
What are you talking about?
RANDY
Elegant descendant of one of the
great Viennese families- the press
would love you. It would speed
things up, apply pressure.
MARIA
I love your enthusiasm. After all,
I’m not a spring chicken, we need
to get moving. But in your haste,
there’s been a misunderstanding.
RANDY
There has?
And suddenly her tone changes, a raw nerve has been touched.
She stops her work, folds up the newspaper and puts it in his
hands.
MARIA
I’m not going back to that place.
Not now, not ever.
RANDY
I don’t understand.
MARIA
They destroyed my family. They
killed my friends and forced me to
abandon the people and places that
I loved.
RANDY
Over half a century ago.
MARIA
You think that’s a long time?
RANDY
We’d only go back for a few days.
And now she snaps, shows that steel.

20

MARIA
Randy, you’re not listening! I
would rather die than go back
there. Not for all the paintings in
the world.
She suddenly feels she may have over-reacted, pulls back, and
smiles at him. But she knows she’s made her point.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Anyway, a few days ago you weren’t
even interested in the case, now
you are all over me like a rash.
What happened?
RANDY
Against my better judgement, I
think I like you.
And she gives him a shrewd look. He can’t quite fool her. But
despite his shortcomings, she can’t help liking him back.
INT. MARIA’S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
At home Maria is alone in her living room, sitting in an armchair in her dressing-gown, surrounded by all her things. And
in her face we see that Randy’s suggestion that she should
return has unleashed a tumult of conflicting emotions.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Randy is feeding Dora, who is in a high-chair. Pam, who is a
part-time photographer, has some of her most recent photos
spread out on the kitchen table and is going through them.
It’s obvious that she’s not happy about his decision to go.
RANDY
I’ll be back before you know it.
Four days, a week at most. Depends
on the reception I get.
PAM
So what’s your plan?
RANDY
It’s just a hunch, no real plan.
She stops what she’s doing.
PAM
Are you sure about this?
We’ve waited so long for this. You,
me, Dora. It’s everything we’ve
dreamed of. I don’t think we should
jeopardise that.
RANDY
I’m not emigrating to the Congo,
I’m going to Austria for a few
days, with the firm’s blessing.
What do you think?

21

She stands up, walks over to him, gives him a kiss on the
forehead.
PAM
OK.
And she leaves the room. But her words take the wind out of
his sails and plant some doubt in his mind.
INT. MARIA’S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Still in her nightie and dressing-gown, Maria walks up to the
old record-player, picks up a record to play. The record is
Schubert’s Du Bist Die Ruh, sung by her husband, Fritz. His
name and picture are on the record cover. Near the recordplayer, there is a photo of them both on their wedding day.
With the music playing, she walks slowly over to the dining
room door, opens it. For a few seconds, she stands in the
doorway looking at all of her sister’s belongings. Almost as
if she is frightened of getting closer. Then, slowly, she
moves forwards and starts going through them, picking things
up from time to time to examine them, objects from their
shared past: photographs, letters, books in German, toys. A
whole world. And as she goes through them, a change is
happening in her, a realisation. Finally, she picks up the
old postcard of Adele. And then, a memory returns -INT. ADELE’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 1920S
Adele is sitting in front of her mirror, putting the final
touches to her outfit for a night out. Out of the corner of
her eye she spots Maria, the child, who is peeking through a
gap in the door.
ADELE
I see you Maria. Come closer.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Ich sehe dich Maria. Komm
her.

Maria edges in and comes to stand behind her.
ADELE
Why don’t you help your aunt
put on her favourite
necklace?

ADELE (CONT’D)
Möchtest du deiner Tante
helfen, machst du mir die
kette zu?

She hangs her diamond and pearl necklace around her neck.
ADELE
Your little fingers are
perfect for the job.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Deine kleinen Finger sind
gerade richtig dafür.

Maria does as she’s told, mesmerised by her charismatic aunt
and her beautiful necklace.

22

ADELE
One day soon you’re going to
have to stop being so timid.
Life will demand it of you.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Bald wirst du aufhören
müssen, so schüchtern zu
sein. Das Leben verlangt viel
von uns.

When the necklace is fastened, she turns around and takes
Maria’s face in her hands.
ADELE
Your only enemy is fear.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Dein einziger Feind ist die
Angst.

INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT. 1998
The phone rings in Randy and Pam’s bedroom. They’re sleeping.
Randy wakes, picks it up.
RANDY
Hello?
EXT. MARIA’S GARDEN. NIGHT.
Maria is standing under the Los Angeles night in her garden,
on the wireless phone to him. As she speaks, it takes some
courage to form the words.
MARIA
I know it’s the middle of the night
but if I wait until the morning, I
might change my mind.
She stops for a second, takes a breath.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I’ve decided to face the ghosts.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT.
Randy puts the phone down. Pam has woken, is looking at him
questioningly.
RANDY
She’s complicated.
INT. MARIA’S BOUTIQUE. DAY
Maria attaches a piece of paper to the shop door which reads:
‘THE SHOP WILL BE CLOSED UNTIL TUESDAY THE 4TH OF APRIL’. And
as she does it, the doubt has crept in again: is she doing
the right thing?

23

EXT. L.A. HIGHWAY / INT. CAR DAY.
Pam is driving Maria and Randy to the airport. Maria, dressed
to the nines for the trip, is in the front seat. Randy is in
the back.
PAM
Your Mom called again this morning.
She wants you to visit the
Holocaust memorial while you’re
over there.
RANDY
I know. She’s asked me seven times.
PAM
She said you should do it in honour
of her grandparents.
MARIA
Siegmund and Malvina. She had the
most beautiful eyes, like an owl.
RANDY
I noticed that’s a big suitcase
you’re bringing along, Maria. You
sure you’re taking enough stuff?
MARIA
If I’m going back, I might as well
do it in style. Now Pam, darling,
would you mind going a little
quicker, we’ll miss our flight.
RANDY
It doesn’t leave for another four
hours.
MARIA
I want to buy perfume and cognac in
the duty free.
Pam and Randy exchange a shared look in the rear-view mirror
as he pulls a face of mock terror. What is he getting himself
into?
EXT. AN L.A. HIGHWAY. DAY
MARIA (O.S.)
Maybe you should change lanes.
PAM
With pleasure, Mrs. Altmann.
And Pam puts her foot down on the pedal and overtakes another
car. Maria’s bossiness is effective.

24

EXT. VIENNA STREET. DAY. 1938
An abstract, nightmare vision - a Jewish woman in a fur coat
is scrubbing the pavement, surrounded by a jeering, mocking
crowd of people. A moment of absolute degradation. And a
voice is heard.
STEWARD (O.S.)
We’re about to land in
Vienna. Please fasten your
seat-belt.

STEWARD (CONT’D)
Wir werden gleich in Wien
landen. Bitte schnallen sie
sich an.

INT. AUSTRIAN AIRLINES PLANE, ECONOMY CLASS. DAY.
It was a nightmare - and the voice wakes Maria up with a
sudden start. But it’s only the air steward. Maria looks out
of the window at Vienna, shimmering in the spring sunshine
below them.
MARIA
I never thought I’d come back.
She puts her hand on Randy’s. In that one gesture of physical
intimacy, all her fear is obvious. And Randy is a little
taken aback by it - he senses the emotional nature of the job
he’s accepted and this makes him a little nervous.
EXT. VIENNA. DAY.
Montage of Vienna, a world away from Los Angeles: the parks,
the tree-lined avenues, the Schonbrunn Palace.
EXT. VIENNA TAXI. DAY.
Randy and Maria in the back of the cab taking them from the
airport to the hotel. Maria is staring out of the window.
RANDY
Some guy from the Ministry has
agreed to see me tomorrow. I have a
feeling he’s in charge of paperclips.
MARIA
We’re lucky anyone has agreed to
meet us at all.
RANDY
But you don’t have to come, you can
stay at the hotel.
MARIA
We haven’t even arrived and you’re
already thinking of ways to get rid
of me.
RANDY
I didn’t really/

25

MARIA
Anyway, I want to go to the
Belvedere to visit my aunt. The
postcard doesn’t do her justice.
Maria stares out of the window. They are on the Ringstrasse
now, and the car stops at a traffic light by a cafe. Maria
looks through the cafe window. And suddenly, for a second,
through Maria’s eyes, it changes. In the cafe, in amongst all
the people in modern dress, she sees herself as a child, with
her sister Luise, and her aunt Adele. The girls are eating
ice-cream, and Adele is laughing at something one of them has
said.
Maria blinks nervously and it all returns to the present. A
momentary memory.
INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. DAY.
At the reception of their small hotel they are signing in.
The receptionist, a young Austrian man, is writing down the
details from Maria’s passport and notices that she was born
in Vienna.
RECEPTIONIST
You were born in Vienna Mrs.
Altmann?
MARIA
Just round the corner, yes.
RECEPTIONIST
You speak German?

RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

MARIA (CONT’D)
Yes. But I choose to speak English
these days.
RECEPTIONIST
I hope you enjoy your stay.
MARIA
I’ll certainly try.
And there is a nervousness in her which manifests itself in a
slight terseness.
EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DUSK.
Later that night Randy and Maria are walking under the streetlamps of Elizabethstrasse. Suddenly she stops in her tracks.
Her family home stands before them. The emotion is clear in
her eyes and voice. Randy notices.
RANDY
Are you alright, Maria?
MARIA
There it is. No. 18.

Our home.

26

RANDY
It’s beautiful.
But Maria is overwhelmed, and can’t speak.
EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DUSK.
And a few minutes later they are walking round the side of
the house, seeing it from different angles and the memories
have flooded back.
MARIA
The things this house has seen
Randy. Great writers, artists and
musicians passed through these
doors, including your grandfather
of course. And once, Doctor Freud.
On my wedding night, half of Vienna
was here. The world was changing
around us, but we danced on,
unaware. Only half conscious.
RANDY
Too much alcohol?
And the minute it’s out, he knows he’s ruined the moment. She
gives him a withering look. She is incensed.
MARIA
Is everything a joke to you?
And she walks away. He stands in her wake, cursing himself.
EXT. VIENNA HOTEL. NIGHT.
They are nearly back at the hotel now, MARIA walking ahead
angrily, with Randy in tow, feeling her wrath.
MARIA
I think we’ve both made a mistake
coming here.
RANDY
I’m sorry, Maria.
Just as they approach the hotel, a man emerges from the
shadows. It is HUBERTUS CZERNIN: in his mid-forties,
handsome, intellectual and aristocratic.
HUBERTUS
Mrs. Altmann?
Maria and Randy are taken by surprise.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
I spotted your name on the list of
speakers for the restitution
conference and I tracked you down.
Randy is immediately suspicious.

27

RANDY
And you are...?
HUBERTUS
Hubertus Czernin, investigative
reporter. I’ve been called a thorn
in the Austrian backside. I took it
as a great compliment.
He takes Maria’s hand and kisses it. Randy balks a little.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
Welcome to Vienna.
INT. HOTEL BAR. NIGHT.
In the empty bar of the small hotel Maria and Randy have a
whisky with Hubertus. Hubertus places a copy of his magazine
PROFIL on the table in front of them.
HUBERTUS
I’m the editor. My little Austrian
baby. It keeps me sane.
Randy flicks through it, still suspicious.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
When I wrote a piece exposing the
Nazi past of our own President
Waldheim a man walked up to me in
the super-market and spat in my
face. He called me a traitor. I
said to him I was a true Austrian.
Only I know how much I love this
country.
MARIA
And what makes you interested in a
couple of Californian tourists Mr.
Czernin?
HUBERTUS
I just thought you could do with an
Austrian friend.
Randy hands him back the magazine.
RANDY
What for?
HUBERTUS
Like many Americans Mr. Schoenberg,
perhaps you have a tendency to be a
little optimistic.
RANDY
I do?
HUBERTUS
This whole restitution thing began
as a P.R. exercise. Austria wanted
to improve its image abroad.
(MORE)

28
HUBERTUS (CONT'D)
But now it’s turning into a
Pandora’s box.

MARIA
They don’t want to give away their
treasures.
HUBERTUS
So they’re going to put as many
obstacles in your way as possible.
And I might just be able to help
you get over some of them.
RANDY
And what’s in it for you? What’s
your motive?
Hubertus smiles at the abruptness of Randy’s question.
HUBERTUS
Let’s just say it’s a very
particular brand of patriotism.
He stands.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
Now if you’ll excuse me, I think
I’ll treat us to another round of
drinks.
MARIA
Wonderful idea.
And he leaves the table and makes his way to the bar. Randy
continues to look suspicious and Maria uses the opportunity
to score a point.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I like him. At least he has some
manners.
But Randy doesn’t look convinced.
INT. MARIA’S HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT.
Maria is in her nightie, brushing her hair and getting ready
for bed. She goes into the bathroom and pours some water over
her face. She looks into the mirror questioningly. Has she
done the right thing coming back? And YOUNG MARIA appears in
the mirror’s reflection: her twenty-two year old self in her
bridal dress. And we hear the voice of her husband FRITZ, as
he sings a Mozart aria.
INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT. 1938
And it’s the night of her wedding to FRITZ - the whole of
Viennese society in their finery. Fritz comes to the end of
the aria and there is applause as Gustav takes to the floor,
with Therese at his side.

29

GUSTAV
When my daughter Maria told
me that she was marrying an
opera singer I said ‘as long
as he’s not planning to sing
Puccini at the wedding’. So
we settled on Mozart. Let’s
keep the whole thing Austrian
I said.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Als mir meine Tocher Maria
sagte, sie würde einen
Opernsänger heiraten, sagte
ich nur, 'solange er nicht
vorhat, Puccini auf der
Hochzeit zu singen'. Deswegen
einigten wir uns auf Mozart.
Ich sagte, lass uns das Ganze
auf österreichisch machen.

Some laughter, applause.
GUSTAV
I ask you ladies and
gentleman to raise a glass to
Fritz and Maria.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Meine Damen und Herren, ich
bitte Sie, erheben Sie Ihr
Glas und lassen Sie uns auf
Fritz und Maria anstoßen.

WEDDING GUEST
Long live the bride and
groom.

WEDDING GUEST (CONT’D)
Hoch lebe das Brautpaar.

And everybody toasts to ‘Fritz and Maria’.
GUSTAV
These are troubling days. Let
us hope that this memorable
evening is a harbinger of
happier times.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Das sind finstere Zeiten
.Hoffen wir, dass dieser
unvergessliche Abend unter
einem guten Omen für
glücklichere Tage steht.

Vocal agreement by the audience but you can tell that neither
they or Gustav are convinced by these last words.

INT. LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
Maria and Fritz now make their way through the music and the
crowd, being congratulated and feted. They pass by Luise who
is dancing the foxtrot brilliantly.
YOUNG MARIA
So like my sister to upstage
me even on my wedding day!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Typisch meine Schwester! Sogar auf meiner Hochzeit
stiehlt sie mir die Schau.

And her uncle Ferdinand finds them in the bustle.
FERDINAND
Young man you better look
after your treasure here.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Junger Mann, passen Sie gut
auf Ihren Schatz auf.

30

FRITZ
I’ll do my best sir.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Ich werde mein Bestes tun,
mein Herr.

FERDINAND
And now, may I borrow my
niece for a few minutes?

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Und darf ich meine Nichte
jetzt auf ein paar Minuten
entführen?

FRITZ
She’s all yours.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Bitte sehr!

INT. THE ADELE ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
Off one of the corridors, one of the rooms is a shrine to
Adele’s memory. Nothing in it apart from Adele’s portrait,
the other Klimts and vases of flowers. A fire-place too with
a fire burning. Ferdinand and Maria sit under the portrait.
FERDINAND
It makes me sad your aunt
Adele is not here to admire
you today.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Es macht mich traurig dass
deine Tante Adele nicht hier
ist, um dich heute zu
bewundern.

YOUNG MARIA
Me too uncle.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Mich auch, Onkel.

FERDINAND
At least she’s not alive to
witness what is happening to
the country she loved so
much.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Wenigstens muss sie nicht
erleben, was mit ihrem
heissgeliebten Land
geschieht.

He takes out a small jewelry case.
FERDINAND
I want you to have this
Maria.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Ich moechte, dass du sie
bekommst, Maria.

He opens the case: it is Adele’s diamond necklace - the same
one she wears in the painting, the same one Maria fastened
around her neck as a child.
YOUNG MARIA
Her favourite.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ihre Lieblingskette.

Ferdinand stands up and fastens it around her neck. Maria is
deeply moved by the gesture.
FERDINAND
Like her, you are head-strong
and inquiring. Something of
Adele’s spirit is in you.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Wie sie, bist du eigensinnig
und neugierig. Du hast etwas
von Adeles Charakter in dir.

31

YOUNG MARIA
I will always treasure it.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ich werde sie immer zu
schätzen wissen.

Gustav enters with Luise.
YOUNG LUISE
There you are! Come Maria,
it’s time for the cake!

YOUNG LUISE (CONT’D)
Da bist du ja! Komm’ Maria,
es ist Zeit für den Torte!

GUSTAV
The whole world has been
looking for you!

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Die ganze Welt ist auf der
Suche nach Dir!

YOUNG MARIA
Alright, alright.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Schon gut, ich komme.

Maria walks up to her uncle and embraces him. He kisses her.
Luise grabs her by the hand.
YOUNG LUISE
Hurry up! I’m hungry!

YOUNG LUISE (CONT’D)
Mach' schnell ! Ich bin
hungrig!

And she drags Maria out of the room.
FERDINAND
That Maria of yours is a
heart-stealer.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Deine Maria ist
unwiderstehlich.

He walks up to a small drinks tray and pours himself a whisky
and one for his brother. He hands it to him.
FERDINAND
The Chancellor has conceded
on every front. Hitler has
made some empty promise about
Austrian sovereignty but my
bet is that before the end of
the month the Nazis will be
marching round the
Ringstrasse in their
jackboots.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Der Kanzler hat alles
bewilligt. Hitler hat einige
leere Versprechen über
Österreichs Souveränität
gemacht, aber ich wette, dass
die Nazis noch vor Monatsende
in ihren Stiefeln um die
Ringstrasse marschieren
werden.

GUSTAV
You really think that is
possible? The Austrians will
not allow it.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Glaubst du wirklich, dass
das möglich ist? Die
Österreicher werden es nicht
zulassen.

32

FERDINAND
I will leave for Zurich on
Sunday with Luise. By next
week, the rest of you must
join us.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Ich reise am Sonntag mit
Luise nach Zürich. Bis
nächste Woche müsst ihr alle
dort eingetroffen sein.

GUSTAV
We can’t leave, just like
that. There will be much to
do, we have to take our time.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Wir können nicht einfach so
weggehen. Es gibt viel zu
tun, wir brauchen Zeit.

FERDINAND
Like always, you are a
dreamer, Gustav. Time is the
one thing we haven’t got.

FERDINAND (CONT’D)
Du bist wie immer ein
Träumer, Gustav. Zeit ist das
Einzige, was wir nicht haben.

And Gustav cannot ignore these final words. They strike a
chord with him and for the first time, there is a very
palpable worry in his eyes.
INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
After the cutting of the cake, Maria and Fritz are surrounded
by family and friends. Therese is making the most of the
moment as the mother of the bride, making a little speech.
THERESE
Now it is time for the mother
to speak! And all I can do is
wish these children a life of
peace and love.

THERESE (CONT’D)
Jetzt ist es an der Zeit,
dass die Mutter ein paar
Worte spricht! Alles, was ich
tun kann, ist, diesen Kindern
ein Leben in Frieden und
Liebe zu wünschen.

And breaking the solemnity of the moment, Fritz brings a
forkful of cake to Maria’s mouth.
FRITZ
The diet is over, you fit
into your wedding dress. Now
open your mouth and eat some!

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Die Zeit des Abmagerns ist
vorbei, du passt doch in dein
Brautkleid. Jetzt mach den
Mund auf und iss!

YOUNG MARIA
Alright. But I have some news
for you. This is the last
time you’re telling me what
to do!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Gut. Aber ich sage dir, das
ist das letzte Mal, dass du
mir sagst, was ich tun soll!

And everybody laughs as Maria takes a giant bite of the cake.

33

INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
And now everyone is dancing - the family, the guests, the old
and the young. And as the pace of the dance picks up there is
a sense in all of them that this may well be the final dance.
There is spirit and warmth in the dancers but there is also
the knowledge that this is the end of an era. And with that
knowledge, the dance turns slightly frenzied, manic, as if
all who dance are trying to dance their way out of the
terrible fate that awaits them.
INT. ARCHIVES OFFICE, MINISTRY OF CULTURE. DAY. 1998
Randy and Maria are sitting waiting for someone from the
Archive Department. No-one is paying much attention to them.
Randy looks at the clock on the wall.
RANDY
Forty-five minutes.
MARIA
Something tells me we’ll be doing a
lot of waiting in Austria.
An ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE appears, a stern looking woman in her
fifties. She is holding a file. She speaks German.
ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE
Your application to search
the archives has been
received but it has not been
processed yet.

ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
Ihre Anfrage auf
Nachforschung im Archiv ist
eingetroffen, wurde aber noch
nicht bearbeitet.

Randy tries to reply in German but is useless - he has a very
strong American accent and completely mispronounces the
words.
RANDY
Quickly, please.

RANDY (CONT’D)
Schnell, bitte!

ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE
We will let you know when
permission is granted.

ARCHIVE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
Wir werden Sie
benachrichtigen, sobald die
Freigabe erfolgt ist.

And she walks off.
RANDY
I think that’s a no.
MARIA
That’s Austrian bureaucracy for
you. Selectively efficient. And by
the way, I thought you said you had
forgotten most of the German your
grandmother taught you.
RANDY
Thanks, Maria, that’s kind.

34

MARIA
You haven’t forgotten most of it.
You have forgotten all of it.
And she’s walking towards the door, leaving him reeling in
her wake.
INT. OFFICE IN MINISTRY OF CULTURE. DAY.
Randy and Maria are in the office of a junior official in the
Ministry of Culture. The man is superficially cordial and
smiles a lot but there is an air of impatience to him, as if
he has more pressing matters.
JUNIOR OFFICIAL
The Restitution Committee has
decided your case is worthy of a
review Mrs. Altmann.
MARIA
Young Mr. Schoenberg and I have
travelled all this way so we’d
appreciate discussing my case with
the Committee before they make any
decisions at all.
JUNIOR OFFICIAL
The Committee will not be
interacting with external parties.
MARIA
We’re an external party, are we?
RANDY
The paintings belonged to Mrs.
Altmann’s family.
JUNIOR OFFICIAL
It is an internal matter. But you
must trust that all due procedures
will be followed.
And he stands.
JUNIOR OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
And now if you don’t mind, I have a
reception to go to. Do make sure
you enjoy your stay in our
beautiful city. It’s been a real
pleasure to meet you.
And they are ushered into the reception area and the door has
closed behind them.
INT. RECEPTION AREA, MINISTRY OF CULTURE. DAY.
Standing in the reception area, Maria and Randy try to come
to terms with the manner in which they’ve just been treated.
MARIA
This man had the smile of a
psychopath.

35

She jokes but Randy notices she’s been affected by the
meeting.
RANDY
How are you doing?
MARIA
I’m wondering if I have the
strength to deal with these people.
And we’ve only been here a day.
And she gives him a vulnerable smile.
EXT. THE BELVEDERE. DAY.
Randy, Maria and Hubertus are walking towards the main
entrance of the Belvedere in the morning sunshine.
RANDY
It looks like we’re not going to
get a copy of the will before we
have to leave after all.
MARIA
The archive department wasn’t
exactly helpful.
HUBERTUS
Thankfully I have what is commonly
known as a ‘mole’ in the Belvedere.
Someone who can speed things up.
Hubertus hands Randy a piece of paper with a number on it.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
On Mondays the museum is all locked
up. But my friendly mole will be
waiting for you. I hope you’re not
allergic to a little dust.
MARIA
Didn’t I tell you he was going to
be useful, Randy?
HUBERTUS
Be patient, Maria. He’ll soon come
to see that some Austrians are his
friends, whatever their motives.
RANDY
Keep working at it.
And Randy’s little retort is enough for us to know that his
doubts about Hubertus are thawing.
INT. THE BELVEDERE. DAY.
Maria, Randy and Hubertus are walking through the Belvedere
galleries. Suddenly, Maria stops in her tracks. She sees a
portrait she recognises. It is the Klimt portrait of Amalie
Zuckerkandl.

36

MARIA
Amalie Zuckerkandl. Also painted by
Klimt. She was a friend of our
family. She was murdered by the
Nazis.
HUBERTUS
At Belzec death camp, yes. Mrs.
Altmann, your aunt is around this
corner. Are you ready for the
reunion?
They turn the corner and there she is: Klimt’s portrait of
Adele. The emotion is evident on Maria’s face and she can’t
help but whisper her aunt’s name to herself.
MARIA
Aunt Adele.
Randy too is bewitched by the painting, he stares up at it in
awe and admiration.
HUBERTUS
Rightly or wrongly she has become
embedded in Austria’s identity. A
national icon. Adele has become
part of the country’s psyche.
But as he talks Maria’s mind has travelled to the distant
past -CUT TO:
INT. THE ADELE ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT. 1924.
Young Maria looks up at the Klimt painting of her aunt which
now hangs on the wall. Adele approaches her.
ADELE
Do you like it?

ADELE (CONT’D)
Gefällt es dir?

CHILD MARIA
Why is it all gold?

CHILD MARIA (CONT’D)
Warum ist da soviel gold?

Adele sits on the sofa, indicates to Maria that she should
come sit on her knee. She does so. Together they look up at
the painting.
ADELE
Ignore all the gold. That’s
Klimt. Look at my face
instead. Does it resemble me?

ADELE (CONT’D)
Vergiss das ganze Gold. Das
ist Klimt. Schau lieber statt
dessen lieber auf mein
Gesicht. Ist es mir ähnlich?

CHILD MARIA
Yes. But I don’t think you
look happy.

CHILD MARIA (CONT’D)
Ja. Aber du schaust nicht
glücklich aus.

Adele is taken aback by her perception and honesty.

37

ADELE
I wonder what it will be like
to be a woman when you are
older. Whether you will have
to amuse yourself with
trivialities.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Ich frage mich, wie es sein
wird, wenn du erwachsen bist,
wenn du eine frau geworden
bist. Ob du dich wohl mit
belanglosigkeiten zufrieden
geben musst?

She looks at her niece and sees a reflection.
ADELE
Or maybe time will change
things.

ADELE (CONT’D)
Vielleicht ändern sich ja die
Zeiten.

INT. THE BELVEDERE. DAY.
Suddenly the voice of a tour-guide brings her back to the
present. The tour-guide is an Austrian woman and her
followers are a pack of teenage school-children.
TOUR GUIDE
Austria’s own Woman in Gold,
painted by Klimt. One of our
most famous paintings, a
glorious example of Austria’s
heritage.

TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
Österreichs Goldene Adele,
gemalt von Klimt. Eines
unserer berühmtesten Gemälde,
ein herausragendes Beispiel
österreichischen Kulturerbes.

Maria can not control herself. Suddenly, unexpectedly, she
snaps.
MARIA
She was stolen by thieves!

MARIA (CONT’D)
Sie wurde von Dieben
gestohlen!

The tour guide and the students look at her as if she is a
mad woman and then move to another painting. Some of the
teenagers giggle at her. Maria pulls herself together.
RANDY
Maria?
With shaking hands she takes out of her bag a small camera.
MARIA
Excuse the temper of an eccentric
old woman. Mr. Czernin, will you
kindly take a photograph of me and
Randy please?
HUBERTUS
With pleasure.
Maria and Randy pose in front of the painting. Hubertus is
about to take the shot when they are approached by a gruff
guard.

38

GUARD
Taking photographs is forbidden!
And just as quickly, Maria has returned to her usual self.
Calmly, almost flirtatiously, she turns to the guard.
MARIA
This woman is my aunt and this
painting belongs to my family. For
once, please make an exception to
your rules...
She leans forward and peers at his name-tag.
MARIA (CONT’D)
....Franz. Thank-you. You are very
kind and most understanding.
The guard is dumb-struck, speechless.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Come on Randy. Relax and smile.
And they pose for Hubertus who’s enjoyed what he’s just
witnessed. As he takes the photograph we see the two women’s
faces in close proximity - aunt and niece, past and present -EXT. VIENNA. DAY. 1938.
12th of March, 1938: the Anschluss. Nazi troops marching down
the streets of Vienna - and the crowds are jubilant. People
are throwing flowers. Maria and Fritz have come to witness it
all. They stand behind the crowd, trying to blend in, but
find it increasingly difficult. They then run off into a side
street off the main thoroughfare and see streams of joyous
young people running in the opposite direction to them, and
towards the celebrations. Alarmed by all they see, they run.
YOUNG MARIA
Quickly, let’s get home!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Schnell, lass uns Heimgehen!

INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
Maria, Gustav and Fritz are listening to the wireless, trying
to hear the latest news, Therese is looking out of the
window. And all around them the suitcases which had already
been packed.
FRITZ
It says they’ve closed the
borders.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Sie sagen, dass die Grenzen
geschlossen sind.

GUSTAV
My brother was right. We
should have left already.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Mein Bruder hatte Recht. Wir
hätten früher fliehen sollen.

39

THERESE
Come and see!

THERESE (CONT’D)
Shaut her!

They all run over to where Therese is by the window, and look
out. There is a commotion on the street outside: a woman in a
fur coat has been forced to her knees by a group of people
and made to scrub the pavement. The liquid she is using is
obviously caustic - she seems to be in terrible pain when it
comes into contact with her skin. It is the same moment that
Maria saw in her nightmare on the plane on the way to Vienna.
YOUNG MARIA
It’s Mrs. Klein. The wife of
the doctor.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Das ist Die Frau Klein. Die
Frau vom Doktor.

THERESE
What are they doing? What are
they doing to her?

THERESE (CONT’D)
Was machen sie da? Was haben
sie mit ihr vor?

GUSTAV
Forcing her to wash the
pavements with acid.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Sie zwingen sie, den gehsteig
mit Säure zu reinigen.

THERESE
Why? Why are they doing these
things?

THERESE (CONT’D)
Warum? Warum? Warum machen
sie das nur?

GUSTAV
Why do you think, Therese?

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Warum wohl, Therese?

Therese begins to cry. Maria puts her arms around her, trying
to comfort her. Gustav has moved away from the window. He
sits down on the sofa, almost as if he is in a daze.
GUSTAV
What time is it?
FRITZ
Nearly five o’clock,

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Wie spät ist es?

sir.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Fast fünf Uhr.

GUSTAV
It’s Saturday. Fetch me my
cello Maria.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Es ist Samstag. Hol' mir mein
Cello, Maria.

YOUNG MARIA
What for father?

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Wofür, Vater?

40

GUSTAV
It’s Saturday and it’s nearly
five o’clock. Why should this
Saturday be different from
any other?

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Es ist Samstag, und es ist
fast fünf Uhr. Warum sollte
dieser Samstag anders sein
als die anderen?

THERESE
Because it is.

THERESE (CONT’D)
Er ist halt anders.

GUSTAV
I will not allow them! No. I
will not. We will continue. I
will not allow them to touch
us.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Ich werde nicht klein
beigeben! Nein. Das werde ich
nicht. Wir werden weiter
machen. Ich werde nicht
zulassen, dass sie uns ein
Haar krümmen.

YOUNG MARIA
Oh father.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Oh Vater.

GUSTAV
The cello, Maria.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Das cello, Maria.

INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
And now they are all sitting around Gustav who is playing the
cello. And Therese continues to weep quietly. But there is an
extraordinary dignity to the family in this moment.
EXT. A VIENNA STREET. DAY.
Outside the Passport Office make shift tables have been set
up to deal with a barrage of people requesting passports.
Hundreds of people shouting, pushing, and a general sense of
panic. Two officials sit at the table and are being assailed
from every direction. Maria and Fritz are at the front and
one of the officials is looking at their paper-work. Maria,
in crisis, seems to be finding a new strength.
YOUNG MARIA
My husband’s brother is in
England and my uncle in
Switzerland. We have places
to stay in both countries.
There’s only four of us but
we need to leave Austria as
soon as possible!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Der Bruder meines Mannes ist
in England und mein Onkel in
der Schweiz. Wir haben in
beiden Ländern die
Möglichkeit unter zu kommen.
Wir sind nur zu viert und wir
müssen Österreich so schnell
wie möglich verlassen!

OFFICIAL
So do all the other Jews.
What makes you special?

OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
Das trifft auf alle Juden zu.
Was unterscheidet Sie von dem
Rest?

41

EXT. VIENNA STREET. DAY.
A young Jewish boy is being forced by a group of young Nazis
to write JUDEN on the wall of his father’s bakery. One of the
young Nazis jeers at him.
YOUNG NAZI MAN
You had it coming to you,
Jewish scum!

YOUNG NAZI MAN (CONT’D)
Jetzt hast du dein Fett weg,
Judenbengel!

Maria and Fritz walk past nervously, appalled by what they
see. People are rushing to and fro, Vienna is a city in
turmoil. And then, as they run down the road they see another
man painting JUDEN on a wall. As they pass the corner they
see a Jewish family being turfed out of their house.
Furniture is being taken out and books and papers thrown out
out the window. Maria recoils in horror at what she sees but
she and Fritz keep walking, trying to remain unnoticed.
YOUNG MARIA
The hatred. My God, the
hatred.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Dieser Hass. Mein Gott,
dieser Hass.

FRITZ
Don’t look my love, don’t
look.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Schau nicht hin, meine Liebe,
schau nicht hin.

INT. BLOCH-BAUER RESIDENCE, STAIRWELL. DAY.
Maria and Fritz ascend the stairwell to their apartment.
INT. ENTRANCE HALLWAY, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
They rush into the house. Therese is waiting in the hallway.
THERESE
Thank heavens. We were
worried.

THERESE (CONT’D)
Dem Himmel sei Dank. Wir
haben uns schon Sorgen
gemacht.

INT. THE ADELE ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
Maria comes in and finds Gustav under the portrait of Adele.
Something in him has died, he looks a lot older than he did
at her wedding a few days ago.
YOUNG MARIA
Why are you sitting all alone
here Papa?

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Warum sitzt du ganz allein
hier, Papa?

42

GUSTAV
Your mother and I. We are
older. But you and Fritz
must get away. For Therese
and me, it’s different.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Deine Mutter und ich. Wir
sind älter. Aber du und
Fritz, ihr müsst fliehen.
Fur Therese und mich, ist es
anders.

YOUNG MARIA
We’re not going anywhere
without you Papa.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ohne dich gehen wir
nirgendwohin, Papa.

Gustav begins to weep and you know it’s the first time Maria
has ever watched her father cry. He moves his head away from
her as if to hide his grief.
INT. THE ENTRANCE HALLWAY, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
The next morning there is loud knocking and barking voices at
the door. Maria, Fritz, Gustav and Therese congregate in the
hallway - they are still in their dressing gowns.
THERESE
They’re here!

THERESE (CONT’D)
Sie sind da!

GUSTAV
Of course they are. Fritz,
open the door.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Natürlich sind sie da. Fritz,
öffne die Türe.

FRITZ
Yes sir.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Jawohl mein Herr.

He does so and standing on the threshold is the Gestapo agent
Felix Landau in civilian clothes and his two lackeys in
uniform, Heinrich and Klaus. Without waiting to be asked
Landau steps into the house with an air of ownership. He is
obsequious and domineering at once.
LANDAU
Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer?
GUSTAV
My brother is in Switzerland
on business.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Mein Bruder ist geschäftlich
in der Schweiz.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Is that what it’s called?

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Ach, so nennt man das?

He starts to move into the main living areas as if the house
is his own.
Landau moves around the house, taking it all in.

43

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Your brother is guilty of tax
evasion amounting to one
million reichsmark,
perpetrated by his sugar
company. His assets have been
frozen and until the full
amount is paid the
Oberschütze here will be
staying with you - from now
on you are all under house
arrest.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Ihr Bruder hat sich mit
seiner Zuckerfirma der
Steuerhinterziehung in Höhe
von einer Million Reichsmark
schuldig gemacht. Seine
Konten wurden gesperrt. Bis
der volle Betrag bezahlt ist,
wird der Oberschütze hier bei
ihnen bleiben - sie stehen
ab sofort unter Hausarrest!

YOUNG MARIA
My uncle is an honest man and
a law-abiding citizen.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Mein Onkel ist ehrlich und
gesetzestreu.

Landau continues to move around the house paying particular
attention to the art work.
LANDAU (CONT’D)
You are a family who
appreciate the power of art.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Sie sind eine Familie, welche
die Kunst schätzt.

He stops by a Holbein painting.
LANDAU (CONT’D)
Holbein. Impressive.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Holbein. Beeindruckend.

INT. DINING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
Gustav stoically places two sliver candlesticks onto the
dining table. It joins a collection of precious objects which
have been gathered together and spread out on the table jewelry, porcelain and objets d’art. And leaning against a
wall, Gustav’s cello. Landau is standing over the loot and
going through all of the objects, calling them out to
Heinrich who is making a list of them. The Bloch-Bauers all
stand around the room helplessly.
LANDAU
Two gold earring embedded
with precious stones. A
ladies Patek Phillipe wristwatch.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Zwei Gold-Ohrringe mit
gefassten Edelsteinen. Eine
Patek Phillipe Damen
Armbanduhr.

And the next item he picks up is Adele’s necklace,
Ferdinand’s wedding gift to Maria.
LANDAU
A diamond and pearl necklace.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Ein Diamant-und Perlenkette.

Maria is devastated. She is about to protest but Fritz puts
his arm on hers and stops her. Landau walks up to Gustav’s
cello and picks it up, examines it closely.

44

LANDAU
And a cello. Stradivarius of
course. Nothing but the best.

LANDAU (CONT’D)
Und ein cello. Stradivari
natürlich. Nur das Beste.

And Gustav closes his eyes, distraught. Therese can’t bear
it; she steps forward.
THERESE
No, please! It is his source
of joy. Please!

THERESE (CONT’D)
Nein, bitte! Es ist
seine Lebensfreude.
Bitte!

But her words fall on deaf ears.

EXT. THE BELVEDERE GALLERY. DAY. 1998
On a beautiful morning, Randy and Maria make their way to the
Belvedere to meet Hubertus’ mole and search the archives.
RANDY
I really think I could have done
this on my own Maria.
MARIA
I wasn’t going to miss the fun
part. It’s like a James Bond film
and you are Sean Connery.
And as they approach the main entrance, they are met by ANNA,
a chic young woman who works behind the scenes at the
Belvedere.
ANNA
Hello, I’m Anna. It’s an honour to
meet you.
INT. THE BELVEDERE BUNKER - DAY.
Anna guides Randy and Maria into the area behind the scenes,
passing through a security barrier with a special ID. They
pass many works of art which are in temporary storage.
ANNA
Technically what we’re doing is not
illegal, I can authorise it. But
still your discretion will be
appreciated, I like my job, I want
to keep it.

45

RANDY
Discretion assured.
MARIA
We’d never want to get a nice woman
like you into trouble, would we
Randy?
ANNA
Everything from the museum records
prior to 1972 is held in the same
room. But I have to warn you - none
of it has been computerised yet.
She opens a door which leads to a vast room of archives.
INT. BELVEDERE ARCHIVE ROOM. DAY.
Standing in the doorway, Randy, Maria and Anna look at the
room - hundreds of cabinets which contain thousands of files.
ANNA
I think you’re going to have a busy
day.
MARIA
Roll up your sleeves, Randy.
INT. BELVEDERE ARCHIVE ROOM. DAY.
A montage of Randy and Maria over the whole day as they
rummage through thousands of files and documents. The clock
on the wall indicates the passing hours.
INT. BELVEDERE ARCHIVE ROOM. NIGHT.
Just before midnight Randy finds the file he’s looking for.
RANDY
Eureka.
He opens it- and sees pages and pages of documents from the
1930s and 40s. He throws it to Maria. She looks down at it in big bold letters on the front of the file it has a name:
BLOCH-BAUER. She looks up at Randy, moved and excited.
MARIA
This is it!
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
The next morning Hubertus is holding photocopies of all the
documents. Maria and Randy are with him in his beautiful
large study of his flat on the top floor of a Vienna palais the house of an intellectual, cultured man.
HUBERTUS
Congratulations. Quite a treasure
trove of information.

46

RANDY
Hubertus and I were up all night
doing some homework.
MARIA
I’m happy to see you’re getting on
so well.
RANDY
And now we can start putting
together a picture of all that
happened.
HUBERTUS
Maria, you are the living link to
the past.
MARIA
Hanging on with my finger-nails!
HUBERTUS
Tell us what you know.
MARIA
My aunt Adele died in 1925.
INT. ADELE’S BEDROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT. 1925
Adele is dead, laid out in her bed with a weeping Ferdinand
by her side.
MARIA
Meningitis. She was only forty
three years old. My uncle was
devastated. He said that a large
part of him died with her.
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
RANDY
Was there ever talk of a will?
MARIA
I remember my uncle mentioning that
she’d written one.
RANDY
She had. In 1923, two years before
her death.
HUBERTUS
And now, thanks to your brilliant
detective work..
Hubertus picks out of the photocopies a copy of the will,
shows it to Maria: Adele’s signature stands out.
MARIA
Her signature, mein Gott.

47

HUBERTUS
I’ll translate as accurately as I
can. This is the part which
interests us.
He starts to translate a part of the will to them.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
“I kindly ask my husband to
bequeath..”
INT. STUDY, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT. 1923
In Gustav’s study, with Gustav standing by her side, Adele
writes her will.
HUBERTUS
“..my portrait and the other Klimt
paintings after his death to the
Belvedere Gallery in Vienna..”
And we watch her signing it: Adele Bloch-Bauer.
ADELE
Adele Bloch-Bauer.
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
MARIA
So she did leave them to the
gallery after all. Dear me, we’ve
come all this way for nothing. Is
this what’s known as an anti-climax
Randy?
HUBERTUS
One step at a time. You’re right
Maria, she does in fact request for
the paintings to go to the
Belvedere but the request has a
very specific condition attached to
it.
And he picks up the will again, reads a phrase from it.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
“Nach seinem Tode”.
MARIA
‘After his death.’
RANDY
She specifically asks for the
painting to be given to the
Belvedere after Ferdinand’s death.
HUBERTUS
Let’s tell the story
chronologically. Maria, do you have
any idea of what happened to your
family’s property after you got
away?

48

MARIA
Not at all. Unlike Lot’s wife, I
never looked back.
HUBERTUS
But maybe now it’s time to know.
Randy, why don’t you tell us about
the home-work you’ve been doing.
MARIA
I don’t care if it’s ten o’clock in
the morning. Pour me a stiff drink.
INT. LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY. 1939
The space is full of the cream of the Nazi hierarchy and
various art curators - all of them walking around the house,
admiring the art, making notes, cutting deals.
RANDY
After you escaped Austria Maria,
your house became the scene of what
can only be described as one of the
great Viennese auctions of the day.
HUBERTUS
Your family’s belongings ended up
in the hands of the most powerful
criminals of the Nazi elite.
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
This news is affecting Maria, every new piece of information
like a stab in the heart.
MARIA
All our personal things...
RANDY
Handed over to whoever took a shine
to them. And they had a word for
it.
HUBERTUS
Aryanisation.
EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE - DAY.
Two men in Nazi uniform are carrying a painting out of the
house and loading it into the back of a small truck. The
painting is not visible, covered in cloth.
HUBERTUS
Did you know for instance that one
of your uncle’s favourite
paintings, a Waldmuller portrait of
Count Esterhazy as a boy..

49

INT. THE LIVING ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
And Maria as a small child is going through her uncle’s stamp
collection, with Ferdinand by her side. They are sitting on
the sofa and on the wall above them hangs the Waldmuller.
MARIA
I remember it, it was in the livingroom. One of his favourite
paintings..
INT. BERGHOF. DAY.
And the painting is unveiled in a room near a window through
which we catch a glimpse of snow-capped mountains.
HUBERTUS
..ended up decorating the walls of
no less a place than the Berghof,
Hitler’s private residence in the
Bavarian Alps.
And we see the back of a man whom we suspect is Hitler
admiring the new acquisition.
INT. VIENNA STATE OPERA. NIGHT.
A glittering audience populated by Nazis and their female
companions fill the Opera House during a performance of a
Wagner opera. On stage, a tenor sings an aria. And in the
audience, on one of the balconies, HERMAN GOERING sits next
to his young wife EMMY who is wearing Adele’s necklace and
glows with the knowledge that all admiring eyes are on her.
HUBERTUS
Or that your Aunt’s necklace, the
same one she wears in the Klimt
portrait, came to adorn the neck of
Emmy Goering, Herman Goering’s
young wife.
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
Maria’s devastation grows as she hears of the fate of her
family’s most treasured possessions. She takes a swig of the
bourbon that Hubertus has poured for her.
MARIA
I almost wish you hadn’t told me
all this.
HUBERTUS
None of the proceeds of this sale
of course trickled through to your
family.
MARIA
Not a shilling.

50

INT. THE ADELE ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
A man sits in the Adele room, looking up at the portrait in
admiration as he smokes a cigar: BRUNO GRIMSHITZ.
HUBERTUS
The Nazis themselves were not that
keen on the Klimts - they were,
after all, a little too degenerate
for their taste. But the paintings
caught the eye of someone with a
more prescient and refined
appreciation of art: Bruno
Grimshitz, the Director of the
Belvedere Gallery.
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
MARIA
Grimshitz. An appropriately named
character.
INT. THE ADELE ROOM, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT.
And now we watch the portrait of Adele being taken off the
wall in Elizabethstrasse by two men in Nazi uniform with
Grimshitz supervising.
HUBERTUS
The paintings were taken off the
walls of your family home and
carefully transported to what
became their final resting place.
INT. THE BELVEDERE. DAY
And we watch the portrait of Adele being hung carefully in
the Gallery as Grimshitz looks on.
RANDY
Grimshitz knew a masterpiece when
he saw it.
And then, out of nowhere, a constantly changing parade of
museum visitors through the post-war decades from 1946 to the
present pass by the painting, many pausing to admire it.
HUBERTUS
Of course, certain facts had to be
altered. Like your Aunt’s name for
instance. And her Jewish provenance
of course. For a short while after
the war she became simply known
as..
And a visitor leans in to observe the name of the painting
written on a plaque: WOMAN IN GOLD.

51

INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
RANDY
Woman in Gold.
MARIA
Even her identity was stolen from
her.
HUBERTUS
It was not enough to rob your
family and try to destroy it. You
had to be eradicated from history.
MARIA
We were Jewish, after all.
RANDY
So the paintings reached the
Belvedere...
HUBERTUS
In 1941. Your uncle, if I’m not
mistaken Maria died..
MARIA
At the end of the war, in fortyfive.
HUBERTUS
A whole four years later.
RANDY
So contrary to the request in
Adele’s will they were there well
before his death.
MARIA
He died in that hotel in Zurich
alone, having lost everything.
HUBERTUS
And if I’m not mistaken, he wrote
his own will before he died..
MARIA
He did, yes.
INT. HOTEL BEDROOM, ZURICH. DAY.
Ferdinand writes a will in his hotel bedroom and we see the
two names of his nieces as he pens them: Luise, Maria.
HUBERTUS
Leaving his entire fortune, or at
least the shreds that were left of
it, to you and your sister, his
only living heirs.

52

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM, ZURICH. NIGHT.
Ferdinand sits on the edge of his bed, staring into the past,
alone, approaching the end of his life.
HUBERTUS
It was one of the last things he
did before he died a few days
later.
INT. HUBERTUS’ STUDY. DAY.
HUBERTUS
After the war your sister appointed
the lawyer Johann Rinesch to see
what he could do. An honest man I
think, but slightly ineffectual.
RANDY
That’s a kind understatement.
HUBERTUS
He started making inquiries about
the will but didn’t get very far.
RANDY
Eventually, the Belvedere persuaded
him to sign the export permits as
guarantee that you’d never go after
the Klimts.
HUBERTUS
And from that point on, either
through oversight or intent, the
manner in which the paintings got
to the Belvedere in the first place
was concealed.
MARIA
So for decades the truth was
obscured.
RANDY
Until now.
MARIA
But even if all this happened, the
simple fact is that Adele’s will
does ask for them to go there. So
we haven’t really got a case.
HUBERTUS
We’ve kept the best for last. Randy
why don’t you show Maria our trump
card?
And Randy triumphantly brings out an official looking
document form the Bloch-Bauer file.
MARIA
What’s this?

53

RANDY
A declaration by your father that
Ferdinand paid for the paintings.
He was the rightful owner, not
Adele.
HUBERTUS
The paintings weren’t hers to give
away.
And the magnitude of what they reveal suddenly dawns on her.
MARIA
The will is invalid.
RANDY
Technically, it’s not even a will.
It’s not legally binding. It’s a
wish, that’s all.
MARIA
Adele’s wish.
HUBERTUS
So now we need to get all this to
Rudolf Wran, the head of the
restitution committee.
Randy punches the air, starts moving around the room, he
can’t control his excitement.
RANDY
Yes! And then your aunt is coming
home with us, Maria!
HUBERTUS
Randy, wait, take a deep breath,
sit down, listen.
Randy does as he’s told, he sits.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
She is the Mona Lisa of Austria
Randy.
RANDY
I don’t care if she’s Botticelli’s
fucking Venus! They haven’t got a
leg to stand on.
Maria and Hubertus look at each other.
MARIA
That’s what happens when he gets
excited. He starts expanding his
vocabulary.
INT. THE RESTITUTION COMMITTEE OFFICES. DAY.
Randy and Maria are trying to arrange a meeting with RUDOLF
WRAN, the chairman of the Restitution Committee but are not
having much luck with his receptionist.

54

RANDY
The thing is I’ve already left him
four messages this morning.
SECRETARY
Mr. Wran is very busy you
understand.
MARIA
We realise that but it’s essential
that we speak to him.
SECRETARY
Why don’t you leave him a message?
MARIA
My dear girl, we’re going around in
circles.
Suddenly, at the far end of the room two men walk out of
Wran’s office and start to make their way to the main
entrance of the building. Maria spots them.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Is that him Randy?
Randy looks and starts to move towards him with speed, Maria
in tow. The secretary shouts after them.
SECRETARY
I think it’s best if you leave a
message.
Randy and Maria catch up with Wran who is now alone - the
other man has left the building. Randy is out of breath.
RANDY
Mr. Wran? Rudolf Wran?
Wran looks apprehensive.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Randy Schoenberg. And this is my
client, Mrs. Altmann.
WRAN
Of course. I am so sorry I haven’t
had a moment to reply to your
calls.
Maria decides to play her flattering card.
MARIA
Please don’t apologise, important
men like yourself must be very
busy.
RANDY
There’s quite a bit of new
information the restitution
committee needs to be aware of
before it comes to any sort of
decision about the Bloch-Bauer
case.

55

WRAN
Is there indeed?
Randy gives Wran the folder.
RANDY
It’s all in there. I’ve made some
observations in the margins.
WRAN
You’ve been busy during your stay
in Vienna I see.
MARIA
We didn’t come here to eat cakes.
WRAN
Mr. Schoenberg, I heard you are the
composer’s grandson. Do you know
what a fan I am of his work?
RANDY
Glad to hear it.
MARIA
I can tell you have very refined
taste, Mr. Wran.
WRAN
The genius of the twelve tone
compositional system should not be
underestimated.
RANDY
I couldn’t agree more.
WRAN
Thank you for your efforts. But we
have all the information we need.
He places the file back in Randy’s hands.
WRAN (CONT’D)
Now if you’ll excuse me, there is
work to be done.
Wran is off and Randy is left holding the file.
RANDY
At least he’s a fan of my
grandfather’s music.
MARIA
That fills me with confidence.
EXT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DAY
In the morning sunlight Randy and Maria approach the Academy.
On a big sign outside it reads: ART RESTITUTION CONFERENCE,
1998.

56

RANDY
So weird to think that Hitler once
applied to be an art student here.
MARIA
I wish they’d accepted him. Who
cares if he wasn’t a Picasso? It
would have been a lot better if he
had spent his life doing tacky
paintings.
INT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS, VIENNA. DAY.
The main room is full of descendants of families who had
their art looted by the Nazis and also by members of the
government and media. The room is buzzing. Before the
speakers commence, all the invited guests are having coffees.
Maria, Randy and Hubertus are standing in the middle of the
throng. Maria looking resplendent in a pink suit.
HUBERTUS
They’re all here. The woman just
coming in the door..
We see ELIZABETH GEHRER being welcomed into the room.
RANDY
Elizabeth Gehrer. Minister of
Culture.
And we see Rudolf Wran greeting her with an embrace.
HUBERTUS
With your new friend Rudolf Wran of
the restitution committee.
MARIA
Our music lover.
HUBERTUS
Quite a turn-out. They’re putting
on a very good show.
INT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DAY
Everyone is seated and there’s a procession of speakers at
the podium and we hear snippets of their speeches. The first
speaker is Elizabeth Gehrer. The whole event is being filmed
for TV.
GEHRER
Welcome to the Restitution
Conference. This is a first step in
beginning to make reparation
towards those whose art was
unlawfully taken away from them.

57

INT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DAY
And now we watch a montage of elderly refugees and Holocaust
survivors giving their testimonies on the art that was stolen
from their families. Firstly, a woman of Maria’s age, who
speaks in German:
ELDERLY REFUGEE LADY
The beautiful mountain
landscape hung in the main
room of our house. It was the
first thing you saw when you
opened the front door.

ELDERLY REFUGEE LADY (CONT’D)
Die schöne Berglandschaft
hing im Wohnzimmer unseres
Hauses. Es war das Erste, was
man gesehen hat, wenn man das
Haus betrat.

INT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DAY
We watch Maria’s reaction to these speeches and how they
resonate with her. And now, an elderly man with a strong
German accent is speaking from the podium.
OLD MAN
I will never forget the day that
they stormed into our house and
took our paintings off the walls.
We sat there, not being able to say
anything, to do anything.
INT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DAY
It’s Maria’s turn : she is on the podium and speaking with
quiet confidence - but it is not easy, her voice trembles
slightly with emotion.
MARIA
When people see the portrait of my
aunt, they see a masterpiece by one
of Austria’s finest artists. When I
see it, I see a woman who talked to
me about philosophy while I brushed
her hair and who told me off for
biting my nails.
There is a ripple of laughter from the audience at this very
particular memory.
MARIA (CONT'D)
A woman who, had she not died
young, would have had to escape
Austria or die in a camp because
she was Jewish. You see,
restitution is an interesting word.
Of course it means compensation,
but it means something else as
well. I looked it up in the
dictionary.
There is some laughter from the audience as she puts on her
glasses and reads from a small piece of paper.

58

MARIA (CONT’D)
‘Restitution: the return of
something to its original state.’
She puts down the paper, looks at her audience.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I know I can’t be a little girl
again but, like so many of my
generation, who were forced to flee
from this city, I would like to
return to my original state. I
would like to be re-united with my
family.
As she speaks these words, quietly and with dignity, she
can’t help the emotion leaking through. And we watch how her
words affect Randy.
EXT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DUSK.
The conference is over and people are leaving through the
main doors into the cold Vienna evening. Randy and Maria are
on the steps of the building. As Maria is putting on her
coat, they are approached by BERNARD KOHLER, a high-ranking
employee of the Belvedere. He hands her his card; she looks
at it. Randy is immediately suspicious.
KOHLER
Mrs. Altmann. Bernard Kohler, I
work at the Belvedere Gallery.
MARIA
How can I help you, Mr. Kohler?
KOHLER
If the decision of the committee is
in your favour, take the three
landscapes. But we implore you, not
the portraits.
MARIA
You have grown attached to them.
KOHLER
We can not imagine Austria without
them.
MARIA
Once the past has been put to
right, I would be open to reaching
an arrangement with you.
KOHLER
I am delighted to hear it. After
all, we are all victims of history,
Mrs. Altmann.
Randy is incredulous at what he’s hearing.

59

RANDY
Maria, can I speak to you for a
minute?
MARIA
Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a
feeling that my lawyer is getting a
trifle nervous.
KOHLER
My phone number is on the card.
Please feel free to call me so we
can resume the conversation.
Kohler smiles, gives a little bow,
fuming.

and walks away. Randy is

RANDY
I think we should be careful what
we say, Maria.
MARIA
What you mean is you think I should
be careful what I say.
RANDY
Just now, you called me your
lawyer. People tend to take advice
from their lawyers.
MARIA
When they ask for it. Now, if
you’ve finished lecturing me, I
think I’m going to walk back to
the hotel.
And she walks off. Randy watches her go, shakes his head,
irritated. The tensions of the visit are getting to them
both. Hubertus approaches him, holding his phone. He has
just received a text message. He shows it to Randy.
HUBERTUS
Bad news: they’ve postponed the
announcement of the verdict till
Wednesday.
RANDY
Perfect. Two days after I’m
expected back at work. That’s just
perfect.
(NB - RANDY’S LINE IS COPIED HERE AND BELOW, SO THAT THE
BELOW SCENE CAN BE ADDED WITHOUT CREATING EXTRA PAGES)
EXT. ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. DUSK
Annoyed by her small altercation with Randy, Maria starts to
make her way down the steps of the Academy. But halfway down
the steps, an elderly aristocratic Austrian man, who is
putting his jacket on, talks to her, casually throwing his
words over his shoulder, not looking at her in the eyes.

60

ELDERLY AUSTRIAN MAN
A powerful speech you gave. But
when will you let the past be the
past? You people never give up, do
you? Not everything is about the
Holocaust.
She reels at this sudden, unexpected burst of anti-Semitism.
For a second she looks as if she might reply. But then she
decides that this man does not merit an answer. She moves on,
down the steps, and towards the road, her dignity intact.

RANDY
Perfect. Two days after I’m
expected back at work. That’s just
perfect.
EXT. PHARMACY, VIENNA STREET. NIGHT.
Maria is walking through the back-streets of the old town
when she suddenly sees a place she recognises - an old
pharmacy that doesn’t look as if it’s changed in a hundred
years. She stops, looks through the window. She lifts her
hand and touches it, as if convincing herself that she’s not
imagining it. And then, memories come flooding back -INT. LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY. 1938.
Fritz is on the telephone. Maria is standing by his side. He
places down the receiver and turns to her. They speak in
hurried whispers because they know that Heinrich the guard,
is in the next room.
FRITZ
My brother has booked the
last two tickets on a flight
to Cologne. We don’t need
passports.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Mein Bruder hat die letzten
zwei Flugscheine nach Köln
gebucht. Wir brauchen keine
Pässe.

YOUNG MARIA
And then what?

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Und was dann?

FRITZ (CONT’D)
From Cologne we make our way
to the German-Dutch border.
There’s a contact - a farmer.
He’s been paid to smuggle us
across.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Von Köln aus versuchen wir
zur deutsch-holländischen
Grenze zu kommen. Dort gibt’s
einen Kontakt - einen Bauern.
Er ist bezahlt, uns hinüber
zu schmuggeln.

YOUNG MARIA
When is the flight to
Cologne?

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Und wann geht der Flug nach
Köln?

FRITZ
Eight o’clock this evening.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Um acht heute Abend.

61

Maria comes up closer, whispers.
YOUNG MARIA
I can’t leave my parents.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ich kann meine Eltern nicht
im Stich lassen.

FRITZ
It’s our last chance, Maria.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Es ist unsere letzte Chance,
Maria.

And she knows he’s right; they’ve run out of options.
FRITZ
But someone has to collect
the tickets for us and take
us to the airport.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Aber jemand muss die
Flugscheine für uns abholen
und uns zum Fughafen bringen.

YOUNG MARIA
A friend of my father’s owes
him a favour.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ein Freund von meinem Vater
schuldet ihm einen Gefallen.

FRITZ
He will never let us out of
his sight.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Er wird uns nie aus den Augen
lassen.

YOUNG MARIA
I have an idea. But first, I
have to say goodbye to them.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ich habe eine Idee. Aber
zuerst muss ich ihnen auf
Wiedersehen sagen.

INT. GUSTAV AND THERESE’S BEDROOM. DAY.
That afternoon, Gustav is in bed, coughing. He looks very
ill, as if his health is deteriorating rapidly. Therese is
sitting by him, reading. The door creaks open and Maria
sticks her head in.
YOUNG MARIA
Mother..father.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Mutter...Vater.

They look up at her and smile weakly.
THERESE
Come here, my darling. Come
and sit with us for a while.

THERESE (CONT’D)
Komm her, meine Schatz. Komm
und setz dich einen Moment zu
uns.

THERESE
The time has come, hasn’t it?

THERESE (CONT’D)
Es ist Zeit Abschied zu
nehmen, stimmt’s?

And Maria has no answer.

62

INT. THE ENTRANCE HALLWAY, ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
Maria is putting on her coat and gloves with determination
oozing out of every pore - she is giving the performance of
her life. Fritz stands by Maria’s side but lets her do the
talking. Heinrich is looking resistant.
YOUNG MARIA
You know as well as I do that
they won’t let my father into
the hospitals because he has
committed the crime of being
Jewish. So the least you can
do is let us go and get him
some medication from the
pharmacy.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Sie wissengenau so gut wie
ich, dass sie meinem Vater
nicht erlauben, ins spital zu
gehen, weil er das Verbrechen
begangen hat, Jude zu sein.
Wir können nur zur Apotheke
gehen und ihm Medikamente
holen.

HEINRICH
And why do both of you need
to go?

HEINRICH (CONT’D)
Und warum müssen Sie beide
gehen?

And now Maria turns with real stridency to Heinrich, she is
becoming a force to be reckoned with.
YOUNG MARIA
Oh for God’s sake, if you’re
that worried we’re going to
run away why don’t you come
with us?

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ach. Um Himmels Willen, wenn
Sie so besorgt sind, dass wir
weglaufen, warum kommen Sie
nicht mit?

Heinrich resigns grudgingly, picks up his coat.
HEINRICH
I take you there but we come
straight back.

HEINRICH (CONT’D)
Ich bringe Sie hin, aber wir
kommen sofort zurück.

YOUNG MARIA
That’s a shame. I was hoping
we could all go to the
cinema.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Schade. Ich hatte gehofft
wir gehen alle zusammen ins
Kino .

And she throws Fritz a look: this is it.
EXT. PHARMACY, VIENNA STREET. DUSK.
It is dusk as Maria, Fritz and Heinrich arrive at the
pharmacy on a quiet side street. It is the same pharmacy that
Maria comes across as an older woman. As they approach,
Heinrich takes out a pack of cigarettes.
HEINRICH
I’m going to smoke a
cigarette. Don’t be longer
than a minute.

HEINRICH (CONT’D)
Ich rauche eine Zigarette.
Sie haben eine Minute.

63

The relief is evident on Maria’s face. Everything is going
according to plan.
YOUNG MARIA
One minute, that’s all.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Eine Minute. Das reicht.

And Maria and Fritz walk in.
INT. THE PHARMACY. DUSK.
Through the window we can see Heinrich smoking. Maria leads
Fritz up to the counter. They are both nervous and the
PHARMACIST, a hawk-like man picks up on it. He gives them a
wary look. Maria clocks the door that leads to the back of
the pharmacy.
PHARMACIST
What can I do for you?

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Was darf es sein?

YOUNG MARIA
My father has a very high
fever and a cough. We need
something that will help
lower his temperature.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Mein Vater hat sehr hohes
Fieber und Husten. Wir
brauchen etwas, das die
Temperatur senkt.

PHARMACIST
Wait here.

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Warten Sie hier.

He makes his way towards the medicine shelves which stand at
the back of the area behind the counter. Maria takes Fritz by
the hand and they go to the door that leads to the back of
the shop. They open it and dart through it.
INT. CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY. DUSK.
Maria and Fritz rush down a small corridor at the rear of the
pharmacy towards a door that leads to the back street. They
try and open it but it is locked. They both start to panic as
they look around for another way out. But there isn’t one.
Fritz notices a big bunch of keys hanging on the wall. He
grabs them and starts trying different keys in the door,
looking for the right one. Maria keeps looking over her
shoulder.
INT. THE PHARMACY. DUSK.
The pharmacist turns back towards the counter with the
medication in hand.
PHARMACIST
This should do it.

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Das sollte helfen.

But he sees they’ve gone. He looks around the shop, can’t see
them. Then he notices Heinrich, in his uniform, waiting for
them outside. He becomes suspicious.

64

And then he sees the open door that leads to the corridor. He
goes through it, like a dog on the scent of something.
INT. THE CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY. DUSK.
The pharmacist walks into the corridor and sees Maria and
Fritz trying the different keys in the door.
PHARMACIST
What are you doing?

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Was machen Sie da?

YOUNG MARIA
I’m feeling faint. I need
some air. Please open the
door.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Ich fühle mich schwach. Ich
brauche etwas Luft. Bitte
öffnen Sie die Tür.

PHARMACIST
This is a private area. If
you want air, go out the way
you came in.

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Dies ist ein privater
Bereich. Wenn Sie Luft
brauchen, gehen Sie dahin, wo
Sie hergekommen sind.

Fritz is desperately trying the keys in the door.
PHARMACIST
Put those keys down! You have
no business being here!

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Legen Sie diese Schlüssel
hin! Sie haben hier nichts zu
suchen!

Maria knows she can’t keep the act going. She tries to appeal
to his kindness.
YOUNG MARIA
Please! Please let us out. We
have done nothing wrong.
Please help us!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Bitte! Bitte lassen Sie uns
raus. Wir haben nichts
Unrechtes getan. Bitte helfen
Sie uns!

PHARMACIST
The soldier smoking on the
street is with you?

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Der Soldat, der auf der
Straße raucht, gehört zu
Ihnen?

YOUNG MARIA
No. Please, quickly, open the
door.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Nein. Bitte, öffnen Sie die
Tür, schnell.

PHARMACIST
I saw you arrive together.

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Ich habe Sie zusammen
ankommen sehen.

YOUNG MARIA
PLEASE!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
BITTE!

65

And then, he figures it out.
PHARMACIST
Of course, you are Jews.

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Natürlich, Sie sind Juden.

And he runs back into the shop and starts shouting to
Heinrich on the street.
PHARMACIST
They are trying to get away!

PHARMACIST (CONT’D)
Die versuchen abzuhauen!

EXT. THE PHARMACY. DUSK.
Heinrich hears the pharmacist calling him. He throws his
cigarette on the pavement and runs into the pharmacy.
INT/EXT. THE CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY. DUSK.
And just as Heinrich comes hurtling into the corridor from
the pharmacy, Fritz finds the right key to the door, opens
it, takes the key out again. He and Maria go darting out into
a courtyard at the rear of the building.
EXT. PHARMACY COURTYARD. DUSK.
Fritz and Maria burst through the door just as Heinrich
reaches it. They struggle as Heinrich tries to open the door
and Fritz to close it. Then, when he manages to slam it shut,
Fritz quickly sticks the key in the lock and locks it. We can
hear Heinrich pounding on it. Fritz and Maria leap up the
steps into the courtyard area where a woman is hanging her
laundry. For a second, her eyes meet Maria’s; she could go
either way. But she decides to help them. She points to the
exit.

WOMAN IN COURTYARD
That way!

WOMAN IN COURTYARD (CONT’D)
Hier lang!

Maria and Fritz run out of the courtyard and into the
streets.
INT/EXT. THE CORRIDOR BEHIND PHARMACY. DUSK.
And in the corridor, Heinrich is cursing and looking for a
way out. He sees a fire hydrant, picks it up, smashes it
against the door. The door panels break; he sticks his arm
through them and unlocks the door from the other side. He
opens the door and rushes out in close pursuit, past the
woman with her washing and into the street.

66

EXT. VIENNA BACK STREETS. DUSK.
Maria and Fritz are running at break neck speed down the
little back streets. They reach a small juncture in the road
and for a second, seem lost. Maria grabs Fritz by the arm.
YOUNG MARIA
The Town Hall is this way!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Das Rathaus ist hier entlang!

And they tear off again down one of the streets.
EXT. VIENNA BACK STREETS. DUSK.
Maria and Fritz are running through a maze of Vienna’s back
streets. They suddenly find themselves at what looks like a
cul-de-sac and stop in their tracks. But then Maria notices
some steps at the end of the road.
YOUNG MARIA
Come! There are steps!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Komm! Hier sind Stufen!

They reach the steps and start running down them but when
they are half way down they spot Heinrich at the bottom of
the steps looking for them. He doesn’t see them. Quietly,
they stop and turn around, start inching their way to the top
again.
But suddenly, two fur-clad, loud women appear at the top of
the stairs, mid-conversation and laughing at something. The
noise attracts Heinrich’s attention; he looks up and sees
Fritz and Maria. They break into a run, pushing by the two
women as they tear past the top of the stairs. One of the
women nearly falls over and just as she regains her balance
Heinrich shoots past her, knocking her over. He chases after
Maria and Fritz. Fritz slips on a step and Heinrich grabs
hold of his coat. Fritz struggles to get away, shouts at
Maria.
FRITZ
Go! Go!

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Lauf! Lauf!

For a second she vacillates; then runs off. Fritz is
struggling to free himself from Heinrich’s clutches.
EXT. BUS DEPOT. DUSK.
Maria is running down the paved back-streets again but now
the Town Hall can be seen ahead. As she enters the building
complex, she runs under the arches, and starts weaving her
way through the columns and through the crowds of people on
their evening walks. Suddenly, she finds herself in a gaggle
of people who surround an Orthodox Jewish man who is having
his ringlets cut off. In horror, she looks on, then looks up
again and sees Fritz standing in the crowd. He smiles for a
second - they have found each other again - but makes a sign
for her to be quiet. He draws her attention to a door behind
them and starts to move towards it. But then Heinrich comes
running towards the crowd. Fritz grabs Maria by the hand and
they push their way through the people and open the door,
disappearing into the depot.

67

But one of the women in the crowd has spotted them, sees
Heinrich, gets suspicious, and decides to betray them. She
shouts to Heinrich.
WOMAN IN QUEUE
Here! They’ve gone in here!

WOMAN IN QUEUE (CONT’D)
Da! Da sind sie hinein!

Heinrich is still a couple of hundred feet away but he starts
running towards the woman, and the door.
INT. BUS DEPOT. DUSK.
Maria and Fritz burst into the bus depot area and find
themselves on a balcony above the place where the car is
parked in amongst a couple of resting buses. Maria spots it
immediately.
YOUNG MARIA
It’s there!

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Da! Da ist der Wagen!

And they tear down the stairs towards it, knowing their
escape is just seconds away. Three steps at a time, they leap
down the two flights of stairs and throw themselves into the
back of the waiting car. The engine roars into action just as
Heinrich appears on the balcony above them. He pulls out a
gun, takes aim and shoots at the car. The bullet hits the
boot but the car escapes through the depot doors and into the
night. Heinrich bangs his gun against the railings.
HEINRICH
Shit!

HEINRICH (CONT’D)
Scheiße!

EXT. VIENNA AERODROME. DUSK.
The car arrives outside the small aerodrome. People
everywhere with suitcases but also a large number of Nazi
soldiers. Maria and Fritz jump out and through the front
window they thank Mr Feldmann, Fritz’s brother’s friend.
Fritz shakes his hand.
YOUNG MARIA
Thank you so much.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Vielen Dank.

MR. FELDMANN
I’d do anything for your
family. Good luck.

MR. FELDMANN (CONT’D)
Ich würde alles für deine
Familie tun. Viel Glück.

And he drives off. Maria and Fritz turn around, take a moment
to compose themselves, and enter the aerodrome.
INT. VIENNA AERODROME. DUSK.
Fritz and Maria are at the check-in, trying to look as casual
as possible. A female employee of the airline is checking
them in when they are approached by a Nazi officer.
NAZI OFFICER
Your tickets please.

NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Ihre Flugscheine bitte.

68

Maria hands him their tickets which he scans.
NAZI OFFICER
Travelling to Cologne?

NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Reisen Sie nach Köln?

FRITZ
Cologne, yes.

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Nach Köln, ja.

NAZI OFFICER
You have no luggage?

NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Haben Sie kein Gepäck?

Fritz is about to talk but looks as if he might lose it;
Maria steps in with great confidence.
YOUNG MARIA
It’s all very unexpected. We
are going for one night. My
husband is understudying
Wotan at the Cologne Opera as
their Baritone has fallen
ill. Von Karajan is
conducting, we’re very
excited.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Es ist alles sehr unerwartet.
Wir bleiben nur für eine
Nacht. Mein Mann springt für
Wotan an der Oper in Köln
ein. Der Bariton ist krank.
Von Karajan dirigiert, wir
sind sehr gespannt.

For a beat it looks as if he won’t buy it. But then it all
sounds so far-fetched that he does; he hands back the papers.
NAZI OFFICER
Good luck.

NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Viel Glück.

YOUNG MARIA
Thank you.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Dankeschön.

And he moves on. And then there is an announcement made for
the departure of the Cologne flight. And the passengers start
to cross the tarmac in order to board the plane.
EXT. THE AERODROME FIELD. DUSK.
It’s getting dark now and the passengers form a queue on the
tarmac in preparation to board the plane. A stewardess stands
at the bottom of the aircraft stairs. Suddenly, one of the
pilots emerges from the plane and comes down the steps. He
whispers something to the stewardess and she then turns to
the passengers.

STEWARDESS
Ladies and gentlemen, bad
news I’m afraid. Due to
extreme weather conditions
our departure will be delayed
by half an hour. We apologise
for the inconvenience.

STEWARDESS (CONT’D)
Meine Damen und Herren,
Aufgrund der extremen
Wetterbedingungen wird sich
unsere Abflug um eine halbe
Stunde verzögern. Wir
entschuldigen uns für die
Unannehmlichkeiten.

69

Some of the passengers make noises of protestation and
annoyance, but Maria and Fritz just look at each other with
anxiety.
THE. THE AERODROME FIELD. NIGHT.
A few minutes have passed and then the pilot gives a sign to
the stewardess from the top of the steps. She turns to the
passengers.
STEWARDESS
We are now ready to start
boarding. Please have your
tickets ready for inspection.

STEWARDESS (CONT’D)
Wir beginnen jetzt mit dem
Einsteigen. Bitte halten sie
ihre Flugscheine zur
Kontrolle bereit.

Suddenly, a vehicle approaches, and stops. A YOUNG NAZI
OFFICER and a SOLDIER jump out of it and run up to the queue.
Maria and Fritz throw each other a nervous look, whilst still
trying to act composed. The officer comes to the side of the
queue while the soldier bars the passengers from boarding.
YOUNG NAZI OFFICER
There are passengers who will
not be boarding this flight
tonight.

YOUNG NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Es gibt Passagiere, die heute
nicht mitfliegen werden.

He looks down at a piece of paper.
YOUNG OFFICIAL
Mr. Stephen Neumann and Mr.
Karl Neumann please, make
yourselves known.

YOUNG OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
Herr Stephan Neumann und Herr
Karl Neumann, melden sie sich
bitte.

Nobody replies. Then, slowly, two figures step forward: a
well-dressed older man, and his teenage son.
YOUNG NAZI OFFICER
Please follow us, both of
you.

YOUNG NAZI OFFICER (CONT’D)
Bitte folgen sie uns.

And, defeated, the two men follow them, leaving behind them
Mrs. Neumann and her younger son, 9, looking bereft. The
boarding now continues. As they climb the steps to board the
aircraft, Fritz can hardly suppress his relief. But Maria is
looking at the men led away, wondering what their fates will
be.
EXT. THE AERODROME STRIP. NIGHT.
The small plane takes off in the night for its flight from
Vienna to Cologne.
INT. THE AIRPLANE. NIGHT.
Maria looks at Fritz with relief in her eyes. But as she
looks out of the window at the fading lights of Vienna below
it is replaced with unfathomable sadness as she thinks of
leaving her mother and father.

70

INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. DAY. 1998.
Randy is in the hotel reception area, leaning over the
reception counter and talking on the phone to Pam. Maria
comes out of the elevator and starts walking towards him.
RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
I know, it’s just they drag their
feet a lot so the whole thing took
longer than I thought it would.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
Pam is on the wireless phone, Dora is in a stroller.
PAM
What did the office say? Don’t they
want you back?
INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. DAY.
Randy is still on the phone to Pam and Maria is tugging on
his sleeve in an excited state.
MARIA
Come on, hurry up, they’re
announcing the decision in an hour.
RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
They’re okay with it, so you
needn’t worry. How’s Dora?
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
Pam tries to keep it light and playful but she’s feeling
lonely.
PAM (ON THE PHONE)
Dora’s missing her Dad. Dora’s
decided she’s not a Gustav Klimt
fan and that Vienna sucks. She’s
teething and really looking forward
to just a tiny bit of normality in
her life. That’s how Dora is. How
are you?
INT. HOTEL RECEPTION. DAY.
And Maria is tugging on his sleeve again.
MARIA
We haven’t got all day, hurry up.
He turns to her, snaps a little.
RANDY
Maria, it’s Pam, it’s my wife. Will
you please give me a moment?

71

She’s slightly taken aback by his rather gruff tone. He
returns to the phone conversation.
RANDY (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, honey, I need to run, I
need to run. Love you.
He replaces the receiver, knows that Pam is not happy.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Okay. That went well.
He’s feeling the pressure and the tensions are slowly rising.
But Maria is still at his elbow, handing him a scarf.
MARIA
And put your scarf on. I don’t want
you to catch pneumonia.
INT. RUDOLF WRAN’S OFFICE. DAY.
Rudolf Wran, Elizabeth Gehrer, GOTTFRIED TOMAN and a YOUNG
WOMAN who takes notes throughout the meeting are in the room.
Toman is bald, elegant, with an immaculate beard and sharp,
intelligent eyes. They are all on edge but cordial as they
greet Maria and Randy. Randy has trouble hiding his nerves.
WRAN
And this is Minister Gehrer.
MARIA
How do you do?
GEHRER
Dr. Toman here is our principal
attorney on this very complicated
case. He has a wide and profound
knowledge of both history and the
law.
RANDY
That’s reassuring.
GEHRER
Please, sit.
They all take their seats and the tension is palpable. Wran
opens up a folder.
WRAN
Some cases are more complicated
than others. But after much
deliberation, we regret to inform
you, Mrs. Altmann, that the
committee has decided that the five
Klimt paintings hanging in the
Belvedere will remain there.
RANDY
Please tell me this is a joke.
MARIA
They are not joking, Randy.

72

TOMAN
Your Aunt’s will should be obeyed.
Randy picks up his brief-case, starts to rummage through some
files and papers he has in there.
RANDY
But that’s the point..it’s not even
a will. The paintings weren’t hers
to give away...here, where is it..
A folder falls from his case, scattering a whole lot of
papers on the floor. He kneels down and starts to pick them
up, talking as he does so.
RANDY (CONT’D)
We have proof that the paintings
were Ferdinand’s property, not his
wife’s, which makes her will
invalid.
He looks up and sees them all staring down at him. Toman has
picked up one piece of paper which he hands to him.
TOMAN
I think this is the one you are
looking for.
RANDY
And that’s ignoring the fact that
there was a deliberate cover-up to
conceal the manner in which the
paintings ended up in the Gallery.
MARIA
I don’t think they are interested
in facts, Randy.
Randy sits back in his chair, in shock. Toman takes the
opportunity to state his argument.
TOMAN
Your Aunt’s request needs to be
respected, Mrs. Altmann.
RANDY
It’s not a legally binding will!
Maria tries a different tact. She speaks quietly, with great
emotion restrained by dignity.
MARIA
When my aunt wrote those words
Austria was not the same country.
It was not imprisoning and killing
her friends, her people.
GEHRER
Our decision is non-negotiable. If
you don’t agree with it, your only
option is to pursue the case in
court.
A pause. And then Maria stands up.

73

MARIA
Come on Randy, let’s go.
She makes her way to the door, turns around. Looks straight
at Toman, speaks with a quiet ferocity in her voice.
MARIA (CONT’D)
You speak of my aunt, Dr. Toman, as
if you knew her. You did not know
her. And I can tell you now that
what you have decided today would
make her ashamed to call herself an
Austrian. And it should make you
ashamed, as well.
And she opens the door and goes. An on the faces of the
Austrians we know that her words have touched a chord.
EXT. VIENNA STREET. DAY.
Later that afternoon, Maria and Randy are walking back to
their hotel with Hubertus, trying to come up with another
solution.
HUBERTUS
It’s not America. In order to
pursue the case in Austria the
government demands a deposit
against the cost of $1.8 million
dollars. And that’s for starters.
MARIA
One point eight million?
HUBERTUS
Based on a portion of the estimated
value of the paintings.
RANDY
On the one hand they’re saying
‘take us to court’, on another it’s
financially impossible for us to do
so.
HUBERTUS
Your hands are tied behind your
back, correct.
RANDY
What about some sort of
arbitration? Here, in Vienna.
HUBERTUS
Nobody here will decide to give you
back the paintings, Randy. It would
be a waste of time and money.
It’s a dead end and they all know it.
MARIA
Hubertus, thank you so much for all
your effort.
(MORE)

74
MARIA (CONT'D)
But no more day-dreams. Come Randy,
we have some packing to do.

INT. MARIA’S HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.
Maria is at the window of her room, the TV on silent in the
background. She is looking out over the Vienna roof-tops. Her
suit-case is open on the bed. Suddenly, it looks like she
might break down - all the tensions and frustrations of the
return to Vienna have taken their toll. There’s a knock at
the door. She pulls herself together and opens it; it’s
Randy.
RANDY
Just checking on you.
MARIA
Come in. Sit down.
He does as he’s told, sits on the edge of her bed as she
continues packing.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I’m exhausted. That’s what happens
when you have to deal with a lot of
grim shits.
They laugh together. Then she starts to pack.
MARIA (CONT’D)
They will never admit what they
did. Because if they admit to one
thing, then they have to admit to
it all.
RANDY
Admit to what?
MARIA
They were never victims. Most of
them threw flowers and opened their
arms to greet the Nazis. That’s the
simple truth.
Suddenly, Randy spots Elizabeth Gehrer on the CNN news. He
grabs the remote control and turns on the volume.
GEHRER
It is with great pleasure that I
announce that Adele will be
remaining in Austria. This is a
victory for the Belvedere Gallery
and a victory for the Austrian
people.
Randy picks up a pair of socks he finds on the bed and throws
them at the TV in rage. Maria picks up the remote and
switches it off.

75

MARIA
Enough. Tomorrow, we go home. And
on the way to the airport, we pay
our respects. That way, we will not
have come here in vain.
EXT. THE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL, VIENNA. DAY.
And in the soft morning light, Maria and Randy visit the
Rachel Whiteread Holocaust memorial in Judenplatz. Randy is
running his fingers across the engraving of the word
Treblinka.
RANDY
The place my great-grandparents
were murdered.
MARIA
I remember them well. They lived in
a house with a cherry blossom in
the garden. She always gave me
sweets when I visited. And she had
the most beautiful eyes.
RANDY
Like an owl.
She is surprised that he remembers how she describes them.
MARIA
Your mother reminds me of her.
And once again he runs his fingers over the engraved word.
RANDY
And then they were taken away in
the middle of the night.
Both are clearly affected by this experience.
MARIA
Come, we should be leaving for the
airport.
RANDY
I know, perfume and cognac. Give me
a minute, I just need to use the
men’s room.
And he heads to a nearby cafe.
INT. CAFE TOILETS. DAY.
Randy is in the toilets and he finds an empty cubicle. He
walks in, closes the door behind him. Something has happened.
Everything has accumulated - the stress, the disappointment,
the injustice. And the visit to the memorial has suddenly
made the wound go deeper. He erupts, banging his fist against
the cubicle wall. In this one moment, we begin to see how the
events of his experience are changing him profoundly as a
human being.

76

EXT. LOS ANGELES. DAY.
Montage of Los Angeles - the sunshine, the freeways, the
suburbs, the water-sprinklers.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
Maria, Randy, Pam, Barbara and a few friends have convened
for a welcome-back barbecue. Randy stands in the middle of
the group, with Pam at his side.
RANDY
Grandfather Zeisl once said that
the three things he hated most in
life were Hitler, his grandmother,
and the Los Angeles sun. But right
now I’m going to have to disagree
with him on the third one. Right
now, everything about Los Angeles
is pretty wonderful.
MARIA
If my darling Fritz was still alive
today he would surely be singing an
aria to welcome us back. Any excuse
was good enough!
BARBARA
Welcome back! Ladies and gentlemen,
raise your glasses to Randy and
Maria!
Laughter and applause. They all raise their glasses and
toast Randy and Maria. But in that moment, as if she can now
read him, Maria knows the jollity is a pretense. She goes up
to Randy, speaks privately.
MARIA
We did our best. That’s what
matters. We did everything we
could. The past is the past and now
we must let it go, my dear.
But they both know it won’t be easy.

INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ BEDROOM. NIGHT.
Pam wakes up - Randy isn’t in bed beside her.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
Pam comes into the living room, finds him lying on the floor,
with Dora asleep on his chest.
PAM
Randy?

77

RANDY
I went for the money.
She looks at him, not quite understanding.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Those paintings are worth over a
hundred million dollars. And that’s
why I went out there with her. I
went for the money, Pam.
PAM
It’s okay. It’s natural, don’t beat
yourself up about it. (But now
you’re back and that’s all that
matters.)
RANDY
Is it?
She doesn’t quite understand what he means. But she knows him
enough to know that she’s witnessing a shift in him.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ LIVING ROOM. DAY.
And we see Randy doing a lot of research over the next year
and a half into various legal matters - on the living room
floor receiving some papers coming through on the fax machine
and we see the heading: ART RESTITUTION: INTERNATIONAL
CLAIMS.
INT. RANDY’S OFFICE, BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN. NIGHT.
And in his office too, poring over various files at night,
with the lights of L.A. twinkling in the background.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN. NIGHT.
And then back in the kitchen - and the clock says it’s 3 a.m.
And he’s on the internet and he’s looking under something
titled : FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITIES ACT. But he’s getting
nowhere, he can’t crack it, he’s getting frustrated reading
the small print.
EXT. BARNES AND NOBLE BOOKSTORE. DAY.
Randy walks towards the bookstore.
EXT./INT. BARNES AND NOBLE BOOKSTORE. DAY.
Randy is in a Barnes and Noble bookstore in LA, looking
through books. He’s in the Art section and he suddenly sees a
book on Klimt. Picks it up, leafs through it. Then his eye
falls onto another book nearby: a glossy Belvedere catalogue.
He’s struck by an idea- gets excited. He takes the book up to
the counter, gives it to the CASHIER.

78

CASHIER
That’s twenty nine dollars sir.

EXT. MARIA’S BOUTIQUE. DAY.
Randy runs up to Maria’s shop holding the Belvedere
catalogue. He is out of breath. He can see Maria through the
window, helping a WOMAN CUSTOMER, but still rushes in, waving
the catalogue.
INT/EXT. MARIA’S BOUTIQUE. DAY.
As she puts the customer’s sweater into a bag, Randy enters
the shop and stands there, out of breath and holding the
catalogue. Maria is still helping her customer.
MARIA
There you go. I hope your husband
likes you in it as much as I do.
As the Woman Customer walks by Randy on her way out, she
can’t help giving him a funny look. He smiles back at her.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Thank you, Mrs. Scheff.
And she’s gone. Randy is still breathless.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Well, fancy seeing you after all
this time.
RANDY
Belvedere Gallery catalogue. On
sale. In Barnes and Noble. On
Wilshire.
MARIA
Hello to you too. Now will you
please explain to me what you are
babbling on about?
RANDY
Maria, you don’t understand. You
can sue them here! In the U.S.
MARIA
Oh, not all that again. Anyway, I
thought you said we couldn’t sue
them over here. That Foreign State
Immunity thing.
RANDY
I did. But I found a loophole.
Three conditions.
MARIA
Which are...?

79

RANDY
When the property was taken in
violation of international law.
MARIA
Which it was.
RANDY
Thank you. When the property is
owned by an agency of a foreign
state.
MARIA
You mean the Belvedere Gallery?
RANDY
Thank you. When that agency is
engaged in a commercial activity in
the USA.
MARIA
Selling a book in Barnes and Noble?
RANDY
Tick, tick, tick. Three ticks. If
you meet all these criteria, you
can sue. You meet them. So you can
sue.
MARIA
Only trouble is, I don’t think I
want to.
He looks at her, uncomprehending.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Don’t you remember what I said to
you, Randy? There comes a time when
you have to move on.
But from his incredulous expression, it’s clear that that
time hasn’t yet come for Randy.
INT. BERGEN BROWN SHERMAN OFFICES. DAY.
Sherman is striding through the offices, late for a lunch
appointment. Randy is stalking him excitedly. As he walks
Sherman scans a file that Randy has given him.
SHERMAN
It’s a long shot. For starters
there’s no precedent.
RANDY
There’s one case I found, it’s in
there, Jewish family from Argentina
lost a hotel. Sued the Argentinians
over here because they’d advertised
the hotel in the U.S.
They get to the elevator. Sherman gets in, Randy doesn’t.

80

SHERMAN
The answer is no.
RANDY
I have a feeling about this sir.
SHERMAN
Since when have we been paying you
to have feelings?
And the elevator door shuts in Randy’s face.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN. NIGHT.
Randy and Pam are at the table, eating dinner. The atmosphere
is heavy, Randy isn’t fully present.
PAM
Are you okay?
RANDY
Fine, I’m fine.
PAM
Coz it’s like you’re never here
anymore. Ever since you went on
that trip to Austria it feels as if
a part of you never came back.
He looks at her. He knows she’s right. But he doesn’t have an
answer. Pam gets up and starts clearing the dishes from the
table.
PAM (CONT’D)
And I’m getting so tired of it,
Randy.
He walks up to her, puts his arms around her, tries to kiss
her. But she semi-playfully pushes him away and he knows he’s
testing her patience in a way he never has before.
RANDY
I’m sorry.
EXT. L.A. STREET. DUSK.
And at dawn, with a newly discovered grit, Randy is jogging.
And even as he jogs, the mental wheels are turning. But he’s
made his mind up now. (NB - NO AMENDMENT, changes on 77
pushed scene onto an A page).
INT. SHERMAN’S OFFICE. DAY.
And a few hours later he’s with Sherman again, standing in
front of his desk.
SHERMAN
It’s commonly known as an
ultimatum, Randy.

81

Randy says nothing; waits for Sherman to elaborate.
SHERMAN (CONT’D)
I humoured you. Let him go to
Europe, I thought, let him flex his
muscles. God knows, I suppose there
was a small part of me that hoped
you were onto something.
RANDY
I think I am, sir.
SHERMAN
You’re not, Randy. There isn’t a
case. There’s no enforcement
mechanism between the U.S. and
Austria. Unless you think the US
Marshals will show up in Vienna
with a warrant.
RANDY
Just one more go, sir.
SHERMAN
No more goes. I need you here now.
No more extra-curricular stuff. No
more Klimts.
And he goes back to his work. Randy just stands there. But
there’s a reckless look on his face.
EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING. DAY.
Randy runs into the Los Angeles Federal Building, fuelled by
an urgent purpose.
INT. FEDERAL BUILDING. DAY.
Randy walks up to a Court House employee who is sitting
behind the filing window.
RANDY
Hi there. I’d like to file a law
suit against the Austrian
government. I’ve filled in the
summons and here’s the complaint.
COURT HOUSE EMPLOYEE
That’ll cost you a hundred and
sixty five dollars.
He hands her the documents and a cheque.
COURT HOUSE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
I wanna go to Austria one day with
my daughter. She loves kangaroos.

82

EXT. MARIA’S FRONT YARD. DAY.
Maria is kneeling down in her garden, planting seeds, when
suddenly Randy appears in front of her, full of purpose and
short of breath.
RANDY
Maria. Can you come with me please?
I want you to witness something.
INT. THE AUSTRIAN CONSULATE. DAY.
And now they’re in the reception of the consulate and Randy
makes a bee-line for the receptionist. Maria follows, and
watches the whole scene with growing bewilderment.
RANDY
Is Consul Brandstetter around?
CONSULATE RECEPTIONIST
I’m afraid not, sir.
RANDY
Tell him Mrs. Altmann and Randy
Schoenberg dropped by. I think he
may have heard of us.
CONSULATE RECEPTIONIST
Okay.
Maria tries to pull him aside.
MARIA
What do we want with the Austrian
Consul?
Randy turns back to the receptionist.
RANDY
Please inform him we’re just
dropping off a summons and
complaint. We’re taking the
Austrian Government to court.
He takes an envelope out of his jacket pocket, hands it to
her. Maria is flabbergasted.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Have a nice day.
And he makes his way to the exit, with Maria at his heels.
EXT. PARKING LOT.

DAY.

On the open top floor of a car-park, with the L.A. skyline in
the distance, Randy walks briskly with purpose towards the
car. Maria is a few feet behind him.
MARIA
Can you slow down a little and tell
me what’s going on here?

83

RANDY
We’re taking them to Court, Maria.
MARIA
You can’t do this Randy, just going
ahead like a mad steam-roller.
RANDY
Can’t I?
MARIA
Stop walking so fast! I can’t keep
up with you!
He stops at her admonishment and she catches up.
RANDY
I’m sorry.
MARIA
I told you I have no intention of
suing them. I’ve had enough
excitement. I have returned to my
quiet life and I have begun to find
some peace again.
RANDY
Say that again, with conviction.
And she snaps.
MARIA
Oh don’t be so stupid.
And she pulls herself together, takes a second.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Besides, you don’t have the time to
do this. You have a full time job,
remember? You have a family to
support.
And Randy’s expression says it all. Maria gets it. He’s quit.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN.

DAY.

Randy approaches Pam at the bottom of the garden, out of
earshot of Dora who is playing with some toys in the
distance. Randy drops his atom bomb.
RANDY
I quit.
Pam is incredulous, in utter shock. It hasn’t sunk in.
PAM
What do you mean, you quit?
RANDY
My job. I quit my job. I quit, I
quit, I quit.

84

Pam makes a noise of desperation - a sound of utter despair
and rage - and turns away, storms into the house.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN. DAY.
She bursts into the kitchen and rockets through it, on her
way to the bathroom, with Randy in close pursuit.
RANDY
I spoke to my Dad, he said he can
lend us some cash to keep us going
for six months.
PAM
Great, now we owe your parents
money, too. Three hundred thousand
dollars of debt isn’t enough!
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ HALLWAY. DAY.
And Pam reaches the bathroom door, turns on him.
PAM
I’m sick of it, Randy, I’m sick of
you gambling with our lives!
And she slams the door in his face. Randy takes a deep
breath, leans against the door, attempts a confession, speaks
quietly, from the heart.

RANDY
I’m sorry..I..I’m so sorry. You’re
right - what you said the other
night - a part of me never did come
back. Something happened out there,
Pam. I don’t know what it is but I
can’t let it go. I think it’s
important. But I also know that I
can’t do it without you. Not for a
single day, not for an hour.
There’s a beat, and the door opens. She’s been crying but you
can tell his words have already softened her. And then, she
too drops a bomb.
PAM
I’m pregnant. I was going to tell
you over dinner.
It hits him like a train but he does his best to cover.
RANDY
Wow. Okay. Wow. That’s - I mean,
that’s...okay. We’ll manage. You’ll
see. We’ll manage.
He steps forward and puts his arms around her. For a second
she resists, then lets him. And in that moment they are both
aware that their lives are entering unknown territory.

85

INT./EXT. RANDY’S CAR. DAY.
An early Californian morning, just after dawn, and Randy is
driving Maria to the District Court. They are both smartly
dressed for a day in Court. Maria is holding a cup of coffee
and a chocolate donut.
RANDY
They’ve hired Stan Gould from
Heimann Rose, a hot-shot Jewish
law firm.
MARIA
Nice of them to give jobs to Jewish
boys.
RANDY
They’re trying to dismiss the case
on procedural grounds.
MARIA
In the hope that I will die before
we have a trial. But I will do them
the favour of staying alive.
RANDY
Staying alive would be an
advantage.
MARIA
Now, hurry up, because the
chocolate on your donut is melting.
INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT.
In the courtroom Randy and Maria are greeted by STAN GOULD
and Toman. Gould is an impressive looking lawyer whose whole
demeanour breathes with quiet, understated confidence. Randy
has just finished his donut, there is a tiny smidgen of
chocolate on his nose.
RANDY
Mr. Gould.
GOULD
Mr. Schoenberg, Mrs. Altmann.
RANDY
Lovely of you to come all the way
from Austria Dr. Toman. We’re
flattered.
TOMAN
I’ve always wanted to visit
Disneyland. Two birds with one
stone as they say.
MARIA
I hope we make your visit
worthwhile.

86

TOMAN
Mrs Altmann, may I say you are
looking even younger than you did
in Vienna.
MARIA
Thank you Dr. Toman. This morning
I’m feeling as if I have another
fifty years in front of me.
Toman looks confused at the private joke between Maria and
Randy.
COURT OFFICIAL
All rise.
JUDGE FLORENCE COOPER enters. She is an impressive woman with
great authority but not intimidating. Maria takes a small
handkerchief out of her hand-bag and dabs the chocolate off
Randy’s nose.
INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY.
The court case. Judge Cooper sits at the bench. Randy and
Maria on one side, Gould and Toman on the other. The session
is in full swing.
GOULD
Your Honour, the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act was passed in 1976,
a good thirty eight years after the
events in question. It seems to me
obvious that the FSIA rulings can
not be applied retroactively and I
am bewildered that Mrs. Altmann’s
counsel has not advised her of this
fact. It would have saved her a
great deal of inconvenience and an
equal amount of false hope.
Suddenly, Maria puts her hand up and speaks.
MARIA
It really isn’t much of an
inconvenience. If I wasn’t here,
I’d either be at my shop or at home
watching ‘Days of Our Lives’.
Randy is mortified at her interruption, the others can’t
quite believe it. Judge Cooper steps in.
JUDGE COOPER
I’m glad to hear that, Mrs.
Altmann. But from now on, would you
mind speaking only when you are
asked? There are certain procedures
which need to be adhered to in a
court-room.
And Maria smiles apologetically. Randy is still reeling.

87

INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY.
And now Randy is giving his response.
RANDY
Your Honour, Mr.Gould is right to
point out that the FSIA was enacted
in 1976 but he is mistaken in his
theory that it can not be applied
retroactively.
He lifts some documents; hands them to a COURT MARSHALL. The
Court Marshall hands them over to Judge Cooper, who scans
them. Meanwhile, Randy passes copies of them to the
opposition.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Despite the fact that actions
accruing before 1976 are rarer,
they very much exist, these are
just three examples of them.
JUDGE COOPER
Thank you, Mr. Schoenberg, I’m sure
these will prove to be a riveting
read. Let’s adjourn for ten
minutes.
And Randy smiles at her sarcasm.
INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY
Gould again, still confident but a little less so.
GOULD
This is a domestic matter for
Austria. Anything else would be a
violation of its national
sovereignty. After all, there is a
forum available for Mrs. Altmann to
pursue her case in Austria without
resorting to the use of American
courts and American tax-payer’s
money.
INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY
Randy is becoming more confident as he goes on.
RANDY
Your Honour, I applaud Mr. Gould’s
concern for the American tax-payer
but taking the defendant to court
in Austria would require her to be
a multi-milionairess. It is not an
option. In a matter of fact your
Honour, we have exhausted all other
options. If we hadn’t we wouldn’t
be standing before you today.

88

INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY.
And JUDGE COOPER gives her verdict from the bench.
JUDGE COOPER
The plaintiff has adequately proved
that the FSIA can apply to pre 1976
events. Also, due to prohibitive
costs, this Court has decided that
Austria provides an inadequate
forum for resolution of plaintiff’s
claims.
GOULD
Your Honour..
JUDGE COOPER
Defendant’s Motion to dismiss is
denied.
COURT OFFICIAL
All rise.
People stand as Judge Cooper exits. Randy whispers to Maria.
RANDY
First hurdle down.
MARIA
I’ve always thought there should be
more women judges.
INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY.
Randy approaches Toman as he is about to leave the courtroom.
RANDY
Dr. Toman.
TOMAN
Congratulations Mr. Schoenberg. An
unexpected outcome which no doubt
has delighted you.
RANDY
You’re a busy man who can’t be that
keen on spending the good part of
his life traipsing through the U.S.
Court system. I would urge you to
consider mediation.
TOMAN
There will be no mediation Mr.
Schoenberg. You have been
exceptionally lucky today, that is
all. Good-day to you.
Maria, who’s been over-hearing the conversation, waves at
Toman.
MARIA
Enjoy Disneyland!

89

And Toman walks away.
INT. MARIA’S LIVING ROOM. DAY.
Maria is having her hair done at home. EIGHT MONTHS have
passed and she is looking a little more frail. A HAIRDRESSER,
a middle aged woman, has just finished and is showing her the
back of her head with a portable mirror.
MARIA
Appeal, appeal, appeal. The
Austrians keep appealing and
they’re denied every time.
HAIRDRESSER
They don’t give up easily, that
much you have in common.
MARIA
So now we’re going all the way to
the Supreme Court. Which is why I
need you to make me look like a
million dollars.
The phone rings and she leans over and answers it.
MARIA (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
Hello? Randy, what’s happened to
you? I’m getting my hair done
Washington style.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
Randy is on the wireless phone in the garden when Pam
approaches him. She is very noticeably pregnant.
RANDY (ON THE PHONE)
Okay, that’s fine, so I’ll see you
at the airport.
And he switches it off. She’s picked up that he’s troubled by
something.
PAM
What’s wrong?
RANDY
I chickened out. I don’t have the
heart to tell her.
PAM
Tell her what?
RANDY
Our own Government has filed a
brief in Austria’s favour. Can you
believe that?
PAM
Why?

90

RANDY
The Iraq war.
PAM
They need as many friends as they
can get?
RANDY
They don’t want to start
antagonising their allies.
PAM
So now you’re fighting the
Americans as well...
RANDY
Feels like I’m fighting the whole
damn world.
And Pam looks at him. Something in her can’t help admiring
him. And that same thing starts to change her. She doesn’t
want to be one of the people he’s fighting anymore.
PAM
My money’s on you.
EXT. BURTON WAY, L.A. DAY.
In the afternoon sunshine, Maria crosses the street on her
way to The Four Seasons Hotel.
INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL CAFE. DAY.
Maria is in the cafe of The Four Seasons being walked to a
table by a waitress. At the table sits RONALD LAUDER, a man
who exudes elegance and wealth. He stands.
LAUDER
Mrs. Altmann, I’m Ronald Lauder.
MARIA
The son of Estee. I’ve always loved
your mother’s cosmetics. Her lipstick is my favourite.
INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL CAFE. DAY.
A few minutes later. Maria and Lauder are having tea, Lauder
talking with focussed intensity.
LAUDER
The art works stolen by the Nazis
are the last prisoners of World War
Two. And Adele is their queen.
MARIA
My aunt would be flattered.

91

LAUDER
I was a young man when I first saw
the portrait and I instantly fell
in love.
MARIA
She has that effect on people.
LAUDER
Which is why I want her for the
Neue Galerie in New York. I will
put my offer in writing but have no
doubt, it will be substantial.
MARIA
We are jumping the gun a little,
Mr. Lauder.
LAUDER
One needs to do what one can to
make a favourable outcome as likely
as possible . Which brings me to
young Mr. Schoenberg. He’s been a
formidable ally.
MARIA
And continues to be one.
LAUDER
But he’s not cut out for the
Supreme Court Mrs. Altmann. A
little like sending a school-boy
onto the front line.
MARIA
You think so?
LAUDER
I’m willing to pay for you to have
the finest representation from this
point on. The man I have in mind
is to art restitution what Einstein
is to relativity. He’s done his
homework on your case and I’m ready
to parachute him in. Can I ask him
to call you?
MARIA
You can ask him to take a hike.
Lauder is flummoxed.
MARIA (CONT’D)
I’m sticking with my school-boy,
Mr. Lauder. And that’s final.
INT. THE SCHOENBERG’S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
Randy is lying in bed surrounded by pages and pages of work
documents, rehearsing for his imminent appearance at the
Supreme Court. He practices out loud.

92

RANDY
Your Honours, this repeated attempt
by the defence to have the case
dismissed..
Pam appears at the door in her nightie. Considering what
she’s about to say, her attitude is quite relaxed.
PAM
Randy. We need to drop Dora off at
your mother’s and get to the
hospital.
RANDY
You think I should go deeper with
the voice?
PAM
Honey. My water broke.
He looks at her, taking on what she’s just said. In shock. He
jumps up.
RANDY
Okay. Stay calm, stay calm.
But she is calm, he’s the one freaking out as he hurriedly
dresses. Pam calmly takes an overnight bag out, places it on
the bed, and starts putting clothes into it.
PAM
Randy, I’m fine.
RANDY
You’re having a baby.
PAM
I’m aware of that.
RANDY
I’ll get the car. Do you need to
sit? Do you need a glass of water?
PAM
Randy, relax.. I’ve done this
before, I’ll be okay.
She takes some of his ties out, throws them on the bed.
PAM (CONT’D)
Which tie are you going to wear to
the Supreme Court?
RANDY
Are you sure that’s important right
now?
She chucks him a slightly old-fashioned green one.
PAM
Wear the one your Dad got you for
good luck. With the blue shirt.

93

And then she sits on the bed, signals for him to do sit next
to her. He does.
PAM (CONT’D)
You need to take me to the hospital
and then you need to go to
Washington. You need to do it for
all of us.
RANDY
Are you sure that’s what you want?
PAM
Listen to me. I got it wrong.
Whatever I said, I want you to know
I’m with you now. And if it doesn’t
work out, we’ll manage. Either way,
we’ll be okay. You’re doing the
right thing, and I love you.
She touches his face, smiles warmly. And he knows that she
now understands something of why he had to take on the case.
Then, suddenly, movement. She flinches, looks down.
PAM (CONT’D)
He’s getting twitchy.
RANDY
We need to go. I’m not good at the
whole midwife thing.
EXT. WASHINGTON. DAY.
Washington in the winter sun: Capitol Hill, the White House,
The Supreme Court.
INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL. DAY.
Maria is sitting on the edge of the bed coaching Randy who
stands before her.
MARIA
Do it again without the arms.
Randy starts speaking with his arms glued to his side.
RANDY
Mr Chief Justice and may it please
the Court..
MARIA
Now you look like a pillar.
RANDY
This is great for my confidence.
MARIA
Move them but not like before.
Somewhere between a windmill and a
pillar.

94

RANDY
Maria, this really isn’t helping. I
need to go through the briefs.
MARIA
Alright, I’ll leave you alone now.
She gets up and makes her way towards the door. Then turns to
him.
MARIA (CONT’D)
Speak from the heart, Randy, and
you’ll be fine.
RANDY
Will I?
And his question hovers in the air. Suddenly, they’re both
aware that they might be well out of their depth.
EXT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY.
In the morning sunshine, the Supreme Court stands proud.
INT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY.
And in the Court, everybody is settling down for the session
to begin. Randy on the one side with Maria, Gould, Toman and
FRANKS (representing the US Government) on the other. Maria
leans over to Randy again, offers him a cough-sweet.
MARIA
Have a cough drop. They are cherry
flavoured.
Randy takes it but he is a nervous wreck as he shuffles
through his documents. Maria leans further in, puts her hand
on his arm.
MARIA (CONT’D)
You know, my dear, even if we go no
further, we made it to the Supreme
Court. Who’d have thought it? A
little Austrian girl like me...
INT. ELLIS ISLAND DETENTION WARD. DAY. 1938.
On a hot July day, with a view of New York seen through a
window, a few poorly dressed people mill around their bunks
in a dormitory of a tenement for newly-arrived refugees. One
man is tuning an accordion, some children are looking at a
comic book, a woman sits on the edge of her bed, staring
ahead. In amongst them, lying on a bunk, are Maria and
Fritz. They sit on the bed with brochures promoting
California spread out before them. They are sharing a bottle
of cheap wine, and trying to stay cheerful in this new,
unknown country.

95

YOUNG MARIA
Can you please show me the way to
the wash-room, sir?
FRITZ
Now say it again, but with an
American accent. If you say it like
that, nobody will understand you.
YOUNG MARIA
You can talk! You sound like a
silly Frankfurter!
FRITZ
I am a man, not a sausage!
Just then, as they giggle, the door opens and a WARDEN walks
in, someone who works at the tenement. He is holding a
telegram.
WARDEN
Maria Altmann! Which one of you is
Maria Altmann?
YOUNG MARIA
I am!
Maria jumps off the bed and runs up to the man, who hands her
the telegram, then walks out a little gruffly. Maria opens
it, reads it. And we know that whatever it is she is reading,
has suddenly shaken her to the very core. She walks back to
the bunk, almost falling on to it, as her legs buckle. Fritz
puts his hand on hers.
What is it?

FRITZ

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Was ist los?

YOUNG MARIA
It’s from my sister. She’s
waiting for us in California.
But she’s had news from
Vienna.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Es ist von meiner schwester.
Sie wartet auf uns in
Kalifornien. Aber sie hat
Nachrichten aus Wien.

FRITZ
Your parents?

FRITZ (CONT’D)
Deine Eltern?

She collapses into his arms, and weeps.

INT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY.
The session has begun. CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST speaks - he is
an intimidating, authoritative presence.

96

CJ REHNQUIST
We’ll hear argument next in 03-13,
the Republic of Austria v. Maria
Altmann. Mr.Gould.
GOULD
Mr Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court: I’ll keep my argument
succinct sir: this is a domestic
matter for Austria. It has no place
in the American Courts.
CJ REHNQUIST
Mr Franks, representing the United
States Government, your opening
statement please.
Franks is talking now and his age and experience emanate from
his every pore.
FRANKS
Mr Chief Justice, if this law were
to be applied retroactively it
could open claims brought against a
number of foreign states which
would further complicate our
international relations.
CJ REHNQUIST
Give me an example.
FRANKS
Well there are currently cases
pending against countries such as
Japan and France with which..
CJ REHNQUIST
So what you’re saying is that Mrs.
Altmann shouldn’t try and reclaim
her paintings because it might
affect our relations with Japan?
FRANKS
That could be a possible outcome
Your Honour.
CJ REHNQUIST
Mrs. Altmann, it seems that if your
case goes forward world diplomacy
will collapse and you will be
solely responsible.
Subdued laughter from the audience.
INT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY.
Randy stands for his big moment. He is very nervous, very
stiff.

97

RANDY
Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court: We believe that applying
the FSIA is not impermissibly
retroactive.
Chief Justice Rehnquist starts to ask him a question. Randy
is like a bunny in the headlights of a car.
CJ REHNQUIST
Why isn’t it just as easy to say
that it does operate retroactively
because the question is when should
it exercise jurisdiction for a
particular purpose?
Randy is completely lost.
RANDY
I’m sorry. I didn’t understand the
question.
The embarrassment is palpable. Maria looks at the floor.
Toman can’t help but let out a little smirk.
CJ REHNQUIST
I don’t think I did, either.
And the tension is burst. Everyone laughs and Randy sighs
with relief.
CJ REHNQUIST (CONT’D)
Did anyone?
And more laughter.
INT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY.
We watch him grow in confidence and stature with every word.
RANDY
We’re very sensitive to the
Government’s concerns, Mr Chief
Justice, the can of worms argument.
But each country is different and
poses different conditions. Unlike
say Cuba, in Austria’s case there’s
a treaty so there’s no dispute as
to what type of law could apply. We
recommend opening the can but
extracting our one little worm with
a pair of tweezers. And then
closing it shut again.
And laughter from the audience.
RANDY (CONT’D)
The defendants have continuously
tried to frustrate our attempts,
raising every possible objection
and threatening an Armageddon in
international relations.
(MORE)

98
RANDY (CONT’D)
But let’s put things into
perspective here: this is a case
about one woman wanting back what
is rightfully hers. Mrs. Altmann
came to America as a young woman in
search of peace. Let’s give her
justice too.

Maria looks up at Randy and her eyes are beaming with pride.
INT. AN ANTEROOM, THE SUPREME COURT. DAY.
In a room just outside the courtroom, Maria and Randy find
themselves in the middle of a media scrum. A REPORTER places
a mike under Maria.
REPORTER
Mrs. Altmann were you surprised
that the U.S. Government supported
the Austrians in trying to get the
case dismissed?
MARIA
Everybody wants me to hurry up and
die, why not the Americans as well?
The journalists laugh. Randy is standing at the side when he
is approached by another COURT REPORTER.
COURT REPORTER
David Pike, Court Reporter. You
were impressive in there, no doubt.
RANDY
Why, thank you. Randy Schoenberg.
He gives him his card.
COURT REPORTER
Takes about three months for the
verdict to come though. But there’s
no way you’re gonna win.
RANDY
Okay.
COURT REPORTER
I’ve been doing this job for thirtyfour years and I’m always right.
It’s in their body language.
RANDY
Well, thank you very much. That’s a
cheerful way to end the day.
COURT REPORTER
No problem.
And he ambles off leaving Randy dumb-struck to digest what
he’s just heard.

99

INT. THE SCHOENBERG’S BEDROOM. DAY.
Randy rushes into the bedroom with a ridiculously large
bouquet of flowers. And then he sees them: Pam, in bed,
holding their new baby son.
PAM
Hey. Say hi to your son.
RANDY
Hi Nathan.
And he is overwhelmed.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
Superimposed caption: THREE MONTHS LATER.
Maria, Pam and Randy are sitting on the lawn - Pam is holding
Nathan in her arms while Dora runs laughing around Maria.
Dora is looking older than when we last saw her, she’s a real
toddler.
MARIA
She takes after her father. Can’t
sit still for a moment!
RANDY
Are you calling me hyper-active?
MARIA
Like you have spiders crawling in
your underwear all the time.
Randy keeps looking at his watch.
PAM
Sweetie, will you stop looking at
your watch every two minutes?
MARIA
You’re making us all nervous.
RANDY
They said we should hear by noon.
The phone rings. Randy runs indoors to answer it. Maria and
Pam look at each other and smile at the speed with which he’s
run into the house.
INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN. DAY.
He answers the phone. Through the window we can see Pam and
Maria playing with the kids, though obviously on tenterhooks
themselves.
RANDY
Hello?

100

EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY.
Randy comes out, walks up to where Maria and Pam are sitting.
He looks downcast, as if the news is bad.
MARIA
I told you not to get excited but
you didn’t listen to me.
RANDY
Bad news I’m afraid. You can’t give
up yet. The fight goes on.
MARIA
What are you talking about?
RANDY
The Supreme Court has ruled in our
favour. We can take the Austrians
to trial, Maria.
Pam jumps up and hugs him.
PAM
Oh my God, Randy, you did it!
Maria too stands up, walks to him, takes his face in her
hands.
MARIA
From the first moment I saw you, I
knew you were the right man for the
job! That’s why I ignored all the
terrible bits.
And she plants a big smacker on his cheek. Randy smiles but
is holding back a little bit; almost as if he can’t quite
allow himself to feel the joy of the moment.
EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ DRIVEWAY . DAY.
And in the evening light, Randy and Pam are waving at Maria
as she is driven away in a taxi. Randy is holding Nathan, Pam
is holding Dora. But Pam has picked something up in Randy’s
behaviour.
PAM
Are you okay? I thought this was
the outcome you wanted.
RANDY
Just something I’ve been thinking
over that kind of puts a damper on
the celebrations.
She looks at him, not understanding.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Sure, we can take them to court.
But they’ll find other ways to
stretch it out. Could take a few
more years. She might not live to
see the outcome.
(MORE)

101
RANDY (CONT’D)
And we can’t afford it. Four more
months and the bailiff’s at the
door.

PAM
We’ve come so far, there’s no way
we can stop now. I’m frightened,
but I’m with you.
And he kisses her - in acknowledgement of how far she’s
travelled. And then, in that moment, an idea comes to him.
RANDY
There’s only one more thing we
could try.
And then, Pam too, well-versed in the case, gets it.
PAM
Mediation.
INT. BOARDROOM. DAY.
In a slick board-room in Los Angeles, Randy and Maria sit on
the one side of the table, Toman on the other. And between
them sits Professor DIETER BINDER, an elderly Austrian
historian who is the mediator.
BINDER
Welcome.
RANDY
Funny how things turn out in the
end.
TOMAN
We really want to avoid going to
trial here in America.
MARIA
You’ve done an effective job
proving that Dr. Toman.
TOMAN
So we’re happy to consider other
options. Austria is all ears.
MARIA
How very refreshing.
RANDY
Despite my protestations, my client
is prepared to meet you half way.
MARIA
As a gesture of reconciliation I am
willing to allow the paintings to
remain in the Belvedere. All you
have to do is admit that you took
them illegally.

102

RANDY
And then come to an agreement with
us on the question of compensation.
TOMAN
I’m afraid we’re not budging, and
that is final. We will not be
paying for something we believe is
ours and we will fight you to the
death before we concede on this.
Another impasse. Binder steps in.
BINDER
I’m assuming you all want this to
be over so let’s study the other
options we have.
Randy talks but he is already nervous at how his next words
will be taken my Maria.
RANDY
Arbitration in Vienna.
MARIA
Randy!
RANDY
We chose one of the arbitrators,
you choose another. The third is
neutral.
Toman can hardly believe his ears and has trouble concealing
his joy.
TOMAN
Now you are talking sense. This
sounds like a reasonable idea.
But Maria is in shock.
MARIA
Randy, can I speak to you in
private for a moment?
And from her tone, Randy knows she’s having none of it.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE BOARDROOM. DAY.
Maria and Randy are standing outside the boardroom. Through
the glass wall we can see Toman and Binder. Maria is fierce
and adamant. Randy was prepared for this and is doing his
best to reassure her.
MARIA
Have you lost your mind?
RANDY
I want to see you getting your
paintings back Maria. I’d like you
to get them before..

103

MARIA
Before, I die is what you mean.
RANDY
Well, frankly, yes.
MARIA
And you’re crazy enough to think
that some arbitration in Vienna
will vote in our favour?
RANDY
I honestly don’t think we have a
choice.
MARIA
But that means we have to go back
to Austria.
Randy starts to lose his patience with her.
RANDY
Maria. Listen to me. I can’t sit
here arguing with you, okay? I’m
doing what I think is best. You
need to just be quiet for once, and
trust me.
MARIA
No, Randy, I will not be quiet! I’m
sorry. Enough is enough.
And she’s already opened

the door to the boardroom.

INT. BOARDROOM. DAY.
She strides up to where her handbag is, picks it up, turns to
Toman and speaks, dignified and strident in equal measure.
MARIA
Congratulations, Dr. Toman. Your
tactics have succeeded. I am not
playing this game anymore.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
And she sweeps out of the boardroom, leaving Binder
speechless. Toman can’t help but release a tiny look of
satisfaction.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE BOARDROOM. DAY.
And she sweeps by Randy, not stopping for a second.
EXT. MARIA’S FRONT YARD. DAY.
Randy drives up to Maria’s bungalow, pulls over, gets out,
and runs towards the front door. He is worked up, fuming. He
rings the doorbell and a couple of seconds later, Maria opens
the door but doesn’t let him in.

104

RANDY
Nice one, Maria. Thank you.
MARIA
I’m not in the mood, I don’t want
to talk to you.
RANDY
The feeling is mutual but we don’t
have the choice right now.
She tries to close the door, he puts his foot in it and
blocks it.
INT. MARIA’S HALLWAY. DAY.
Exasperated, Maria opens the door, walks into the hallway.
Randy follows her into the house. She turns on him. And when
she speaks it is with a quiet steel in her voice. She’s made
her mind up.
MARIA
It’s over, Randy! We made a
mistake.
RANDY
What’s over? What are you saying?
MARIA
I’m saying that we have to accept
defeat and return to what’s left of
our lives.
RANDY
Are you insane?
MARIA
I’m saying that I’m tired and that
they can keep the paintings. I’m
saying Randy, that as of this
moment, I no longer need your
services.
Randy can not believe what he’s hearing. And when he erupts
Maria is not prepared for the full force of it.
RANDY
Are you kidding me? I have given
everything I have! I am HALF A
MILLION DOLLARS in debt and my wife
and I are..my children, everything
I fucking care about in this
world....and you have the
nerve..everything I’ve done I’ve
done to get those goddamn paintings
back for you...I wish you’d never
asked me.. and you have the nerve
to come to me and say that it’s all
over!
And he stops and Maria is standing there, looking at him,
shaken by his rage. And, softening, he speaks quietly.

105

RANDY (CONT’D)
We’ve come so far...just hang in
there.
MARIA
The Austrians will never let go.
And I won’t be humiliated again. Go
back to Vienna if you have to. But
this time I’m not coming back with
you. You’re on your own Randy.
And the two of them stand silently opposite each other in the
hallway of her small house, shaken by their emotions.
EXT. VIENNA. NIGHT.
Montage of Vienna at night.
EXT. VIENNA STREET. NIGHT.
Randy and Hubertus are walking down a street in the old part
of town.
HUBERTUS
The man you chose for the
arbitration panel is a safe bet..
but I’m a little worried about the
other two, I can’t lie. The one
chosen by the Austrian State is a
strict traditionalist. I can’t see
him deciding in your favour. And as
for the third..well,it’s a gamble.
RANDY
Here’s hoping.
HUBERTUS
But I never thought you’d come
back. And personally, I need to be
honest - I don’t think it’s the
right decision. You are betting on
Austria having changed.
And Hubertus’ eyes suggest that it might be a bet too far.
They pass by a small concert hall. A poster catches Randy’s
eye: there’s an Arnold Schoenberg concert starting in twenty
minutes. He looks at Hubertus and they smile at the
coincidence. Randy checks his watch and runs to the box
office, gives his credit card to the female BOX OFFICE
EMPLOYEE, who takes it.
RANDY
Two tickets, please.
BOX OFFICE EMPLOYEE
It starts in two minutes.
And then she notices the name on the card.
BOX OFFICE EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
You have the same name as the
composer.

106

Hubertus looks at Randy and they smile to each other.
HUBERTUS
What a coincidence.
INT. CONCERT HALL. NIGHT.
Randy and Hubertus sit in the darkened concert hall. Randy
listens proudly to his grandfather’s music, watching the
orchestra playing and the crowd appreciating it. And
something is inspired in him.
INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY.
The arbitration. A large room in a Government building in
Vienna. At a long table sit the three arbitrators. In the
room there is also a sizeable audience which includes
Hubertus, Elizabeth Gehrer, Wran and Toman. Randy stands near
the panel. One of the arbitrators stands.
ARBITRATOR
The Austrian Government has
provided its case in writing for
our perusal. Mr. Schoenberg, you
too were offered the opportunity to
do so but you have opted to present
the introductory points of your
argument orally as well, is that
correct?
RANDY
I have, yes.
ARBITRATOR
The floor is yours.
RANDY
Thank you sir.
Randy stands in the centre of the room and it feels like the
whole of Austria is his audience. He clears his throat, takes
a deep breath but looks uncertain - almost as if he can’t do
it. He begins but his tone lacks confidence, it wavers.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to
be standing before you today for
two reasons. Firstly, like my
opponents in this case I always
believed that this was a domestic
matter for Austria that needed to
be decided within her borders.
Suddenly he’s interrupted: a door opens at the back of the
room. His eyes are drawn to it. It’s Maria. She’s come after
all. She walks up to the front of the room and sits. Randy
comes to her, leans in, and they whisper to each other.
RANDY (CONT’D)
I wasn’t expecting to see you here.

107

MARIA
The first time I came back for
myself. This time I came back for
you. Now, stand up straight.
He looks at her, takes strength from her words, straightens
up, and resumes his opening speech - she has moved and
inspired him. He takes a deep breath and he looks two inches
taller. And the speech is now driven by a new confidence.
RANDY
And the second reason I’m happy to
be in Vienna today is because my
client Mrs. Altmann and I are both
Austrians.
Some of the audience seem surprised but Maria knows what he
means.
RANDY (CONT’D)
Oh, don’t get me wrong, we’re very
much Americans too. But our
families and the roots we share are
situated in the culture of this
very city.
INT. CONCERT HALL, VIENNA.

NIGHT.

And we see a flashback to the night before and Randy
observing the audience as they listen to his grandfather’s
music
INT. KLIMT’S STUDIO. DAY.
And now we see Adele being painted by Klimt once more, as he
puts the final touches to the great painting.
RANDY (V.O.)
And somewhere, in the heart of this
world, stands the woman whose
portrait both sides are fighting
for. Adele Bloch-Bauer.
INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY.
Randy in full flow now, the confident, experienced lawyer he
has become.
RANDY
During my visits to this country I
have discerned that there are two
Austrias: the one that opposes
restitution to the victims of
Nazism, and another that recognises
the injustice committed against
Austria’s Jewish population and
seeks to rectify it.
We watch Dr Toman, Elizabeth Gehrer and Rudolf Wran
responding to what he is saying and then we land on Hubertus:
the two Austrias.

108

RANDY (CONT’D)
As I hope I demonstrate in my
written arguments, the law favours
restitution.
And now, during these next few scenes we watch a flashing
montage of the journey of the painting and the way it ended
up in the Belvedere -EXT. VIENNA. DAY.
The Anchluss: The Viennese crowds greet the Nazis in
celebration, women throwing flowers to welcome them.
RANDY (V.O.)
A string of events and misdeeds
point to the incontestible fact
that the paintings in question
reached the Belvedere Gallery and
remained there for over half a
century in a manner that was both
dishonest and illegal. And that
Adele’s will itself was not legally
binding.
INT. LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
The auction at Elizabethstrasse.
EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
The painting of Adele being loaded onto a truck.
INT. THE BELVEDERE. DAY.
And the painting coming to hang on the wall of the Belvedere
under Grimshitz’s supervision.
INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY.
And as Randy reaches the conclusion he slows his tempo a
little to make sure these last few words really land.
RANDY
In its own way Ladies and Gentlemen
this is a moment of history, a
moment in which the past is asking
something of the present. Many
years ago, (in this very city,)
just beyond these walls, terrible
things happened. People dehumanised
other people - they persecuted
them, sent many to their deaths,
and decimated whole families
breaking them apart forever. And
they stole from them - properties,
livelihoods and the objects that
were most precious to them.
(MORE)

109
RANDY (CONT'D)
Amongst those people were the BlochBauers, the family of a very dear
friend of mine. So now I am asking
you - as Austrians - as human
beings - to recognise that wrong.
(Not just for Maria Altmann but for
Austria.) I am asking you today to
look at the past, as I have, and to
restore what has been taken away.

And his eyes meet Maria’s. And by articulating these last
words, he understands that he too, in some profound way, has
been restored. And it is clear that his words have resonated
with his audience, especially on the faces of Toman and Wran.
EXT. THE PRATER PARK. DAY.
Maria, Randy and Hubertus are walking in the shade of the
Ferris Wheel. Randy is checking his phone.
RANDY
They said they should announce the
verdict by four.
HUBERTUS
One thing is for sure. This country
is about to decide what it really
is.
They approach a bench and sit down on it.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
When I was a child, my father used
to bring me here on Sundays.
MARIA
For waffles and ice-cream, eh?
HUBERTUS
And a ride on the ferris wheel.
And he knows that now is the moment to confide; their
friendship has earned it.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
He was an impressive man, tall and
domineering with his hair always
combed back. Handsome, I suppose.
As a small boy I looked up to him,
worshipped him.
MARIA
You wanted to grow up to be like
him.
HUBERTUS
When I was fifteen I discovered
that he had been a Nazi, Maria. A
passionate follower of the Third
Reich.
His words are coming out with great difficulty, almost as if
he hasn’t spoken them before.

110

HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
All my life I’ve been trying to
make up for the sins of the father.
Every day, asking myself how he
could be the person he was. And
every day trying to move away from
him.
He turns to look at Maria and Randy.
HUBERTUS (CONT’D)
How’s that for a motive, Randy?
RANDY
It’s pretty damn good.
Randy smiles guiltily at the memory of his initial scepticism
of Hubertus. Maria leans over and takes Hubertus’ hand.
MARIA
You are a fine man, Hubertus. A
good man.
Then Randy’s phone goes: a text. He looks at it.
RANDY
Decision time.
INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY.
The room is packed to the rafters. A tense atmosphere - the
moment everyone has been waiting for. Maria, Randy and
Hubertus are squeezed in and nearby are Wran, Toman and
Gehrer. There is also a large media contingent. The main
arbitrator stands and there is a hushed silence.
ARBITRATOR
We, the arbitrators have now
studied both sides of this complex
case. Trying to keep an open mind
as we examined the evidence we have
reached our final verdict.
He walks over to the other arbitrators. One of them hands him
an envelope, which he slowly opens. He puts on his glasses
and reads from it.
ARBITRATOR (CONT’D)
Our decision today is that the
portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer and
the other Klimt paintings in
question should be returned to her
niece, Maria Altmann.
A huge wave of emotion sweeps across the room and on the
faces of all the audience we see a myriad of responses.
Hubertus is profoundly moved and buries his face in his
hands, Randy squeezes Maria’s hand who seems overwhelmed.
Cheers clash with sounds of consternation. Wran and Gehrer
make a quick exit.

111

INT. HALL OUTSIDE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY.
In the excited crowd Randy, Maria and Hubertus embrace and
congratulate each other.
HUBERTUS
For the first time in a long while
I am proud to call myself an
Austrian.
MARIA
You should be.
RANDY
The press are waiting outside
Maria. They want a statement. How
do I look?
MARIA
Sexy and victorious! And how do I
look?
RANDY
Sexy and victorious!
Suddenly, out of nowhere Toman approaches Maria.
TOMAN
Mrs. Altmann, may I have a word?
MARIA
Dr. Toman.
They go to one side.
TOMAN
I am defeated. But I will ask you beg you, entreat you - not to let
these paintings leave their
motherland. Let us come to an
arrangement. I am sure we can make
a generous offer.
MARIA
It makes me sad too that they will
not stay in Adele’s country. But
Dr. Toman all along I have tried to
negotiate, to keep the dialogue
open. And all along you have
thwarted me, closed the doors in my
face. I am tired, Dr. Toman, and my
aunt is now crossing the Atlantic
to make her home in America, like I
once did. Excuse me.
And she makes a move away from him, visibly emotional and
starts to walk down the hall, looking for some privacy.
Hubertus notices; points it out to Randy.
HUBERTUS
I think our friend might be needing
a little attention.

112

Randy sees Maria enter a room off the hall, and follows. But
turns one last time to Hubertus, casually throwing his words
over his shoulder as he moves away.
RANDY
Have I said that we couldn’t have
done it without you?
INT. ROOM OFF THE ARBITRATION HALL. DAY.
Maria has found and entered an empty room off the hall and
closes the door behind her. There is a window and she walks
towards it. She suddenly looks quite frail, takes a few deep
breaths. She is overwhelmed. And then, she remembers the last
time she saw her parents. The goodbye -INT. GUSTAV AND THRESE’S BEDROOM. DAY. 1938
Maria moves into the room and joins Gustav and Therese by the
bed. She kneels down, takes their hands in hers and the three
of them hold on to each other, knowing this may well be the
last time they ever see each other. Therese is crying. When
Gustav speaks it is with some effort, his breathing is
laboured.
YOUNG MARIA
Papa, Mutti, I’m leaving now.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Papa, Mutti, ich gehe jetzt.

GUSTAV
You are doing the right
thing.

GUSTAV (CONT’D)
Du tust das Richtige.

YOUNG MARIA
But I don’t want to.

YOUNG MARIA (CONT’D)
Aber ich will nicht.

THERESE
You have to live, Maria. You
have to move forward into the
future and this place has no
future for you.

THERESE (CONT’D)
Du musst leben, Maria. Du
musst in die Zukunft schauen
und dieser Ort hat für dich
keine Zukunft mehr.

Gustav clutches her hand and looks deep into her eyes. And,
when he next speaks, he speaks in English to her. His accent
is strong but he speaks it beautifully.
GUSTAV
English will become your language
and America will be your home.
YOUNG MARIA
Yes, papa.
GUSTAV
We speak English from now on. You
listen to me now in the language of
your future.

113

And he manages a little laugh. Through tears, Maria laughs
too. But then, still speaking English, his tone changes.
GUSTAV (CONT’D)
When our family moved to Vienna,
Maria, they were not rich people.
We worked hard, we did everything
we could to contribute, and to
belong. We are proud of what we
have done and we are proud of our
children. Nobody can take that away
from us. And now, as you go, I ask
you only one thing, mein liebling.
YOUNG MARIA
What is it Papa?
GUSTAV
Remember us.
And father, mother and daughter fall into each others’ arms
and embrace for the very last time.
Maria stands and walks to the door. When she reaches it, she
turns back one last time and looks at her mother and father.
THERESE
Take us with you, in your
heart, and learn to be happy
again.

THERESE (CONT’D)
Behalte uns in deinem Herzen,
und lerne, wieder glücklich
zu werden.

And Maria goes.

INT. ROOM OFF THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY.
Randy knocks on the door and tentatively pushes it open.
Maria is still standing by the window.
RANDY
Maria?
MARIA
In a moment Randy.
RANDY
Are you alright?
He approaches her. Fighting a huge surge of emotion, she
tries to express herself.
MARIA
Thank you my darling, thank you
with all my heart for what you’ve
done. But foolishly I thought that
it would make everything alright,
make it better.
He looks inquiringly at her, trying to understand. And she
breaks.

114

MARIA (CONT’D)
Nothing can ever do that Randy. I
left them here, I left them here,
my love.
And he opens his arms to embrace her. She falls into them,
and she weeps.
EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
Later, after all the madness, Randy and Maria walk in the
late afternoon sun.
RANDY
So now..
MARIA
I’ve been thinking of that smart
Mr. Lauder. I think I want Aunt
Adele to go and live in his little
gallery. My only condition is that
she will always be on public
display, for everyone to marvel at.
After all, I think she’s a little
too big for my bungalow.
RANDY
You can move house, Maria, buy
anything you want.
MARIA
I’m quite happy where I am, thank
you. And the money can go to
relatives and good causes. I think
it’s what she would have wanted.
RANDY
What about you?
MARIA
Well, I do need a new dish-washer.
She winks at him jokingly, but there is a sadness in her
voice. Suddenly, they are approached by a young Austrian
woman, Susi.
SUSI
Mrs. Altmann? I just wanted to say
how happy I am that you have got
back the paintings. I will miss
seeing them in the Belvedere, but
it is the right thing. For you, and
for Austria.
MARIA
Thank you, my dear.
The young woman smiles and runs off. Maria and Randy walk in
silence for a couple of seconds. And then, quietly, Maria
speaks.

115

MARIA (CONT’D)
Your grandfather would be proud of
you. Without even knowing it, you
have become a torchbearer.
He looks at her, not understanding.
MARIA (CONT’D)
The one who keeps the memory alive,
Randy.
RANDY
I didn’t do it on my own.
And then, a few seconds later, Randy looks up. They are
outside the Elizabethstrasse house. Maria is visibly moved.
And on the spur of the moment, she makes a decision.
MARIA
Give me a moment.
She walks up to the entrance of the building and through the
gate.
INT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE, STAIRWELL. DAY.
Maria walks up the stairs to her former home. She pushes it
open.
INT. THE ENTRANCE HALLWAY. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
Inside, the offices of the Rail Company look like any other
offices - a little bland. A young man who is a RAIL COMPANY
EMPLOYEE walks up to her, smiling.
RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
Can I help you?

RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
(CONT’D)
Kann Ich Ihnen helfen?

MARIA
I know this house. I want to
look around. Just a few
moments.

MARIA (CONT’D)
Ich kenne dieses Haus. Ich
würde mich gern ein wenig
umsehen. Nur einen
Augenblick.

A little baffled, he smiles.
RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
Of course.

RAIL COMPANY EMPLOYEE
(CONT’D)
Natürlich.

And he goes back to work. Maria edges her way forward into
the house. And suddenly, it starts to change.

116

INT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. NIGHT. 2002 / 1930S
Through Maria’s eyes, the house magically transforms into
what it used to be: a warm family home. Music fills the
rooms, something rich, evocative and moving.
As she moves around the house Maria is bedazzled by what she
sees. She wanders from room to room and comes across scenes
from a beautiful childhood and a resplendent Austrian past:
First, in the dining room, she sees her mother Therese
arranging flowers in a vase and being helped by Maria and
Luise, as children.
Then she walks across the hallway, to the living room, where
Gustav is playing the cello for his family: Maria and Luise,
now young women, and Therese. Enraptured, they cluster around
him, enjoying the music.
And then she turns and in another part of the room, she sees
herself and Fritz dancing on their wedding night, twirling
through the admiring guests. She walks through the crowds to
the Adele room and pushes open the door.
She enters and is amazed at what she sees. The room is
buzzing with people - artists, writers, Vienna at its best.
There is art on the wall, and books, and clusters of people
in animated discussion. She makes her way through the crowd
towards the end of the room : Adele sits directly beneath the
Klimt portrait, surrounded by Ferdinand and a group of
friends as they argue passionately about politics, and art,
and life. And next to her is the painter himself, Gustav
Klimt.
Maria approaches them. Ferdinand smiles at her lovingly. And
finally, Adele looks up at her and reaches out for her hand,
and takes it in hers. And when she speaks, it is in German.
Thank you.

ADELE

ADELE (CONT’D)
Dankeschön.

MARIA
I did it for all of us.

MARIA (CONT’D)
Ich habe es für uns alle
getan.

EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY.
Randy is waiting for Maria outside the house. He hears
something, and turns. And there she is, standing on the
threshold of the house. She walks towards him and when she
reaches him she looks slightly different - in her eyes, the
knowledge that even though the past can never be put right,
she has fulfilled her purpose by restoring justice. With
that, comes a relief. And she wouldn’t have been able to do
it without him. Job done.
MARIA
Let’s go home, Randy. Your family
is waiting.

117

And finally, we see Maria back at home, in her bed. She is
about to go to sleep and as she leans over to switch off her
bed-side lamp we see two things on the table beside her bed:
a photograph of her family taken on her wedding day and the
postcard of the portrait of her aunt Adele.
Superimposed caption: SHE DIED AT HER HOME IN LOS ANGELES IN
FEBRUARY 2011.
She leans over and switches off the light.
THE END.
