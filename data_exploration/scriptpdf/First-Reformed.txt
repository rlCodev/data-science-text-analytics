EXT. FIRST REFORMED - CEMETERY - DAY

TOLLER, early 40's, a cleric, dressed in a worn black
clerical garb like a small town judge, tends the historic
cemetery of historic First Reformed Church, upstate New York,
his face like a half rubbed away engraving on those
tombstones, revealed in degrees of shadow. His angular body
lists to the right, as if resisting weight. He is in Agony.
And he writes.

TOLLER STARTS A JOURNAL

Still images of First Reformed Church, Snowbridge, New York,
and environs:
--A yellow on blue iron historical marker reads: “First
Reformed Church, Organized 1752, Built 1765. Occupied 1776 by
New York Provisional Congress. Station in Underground Railway
1845 to 1850. Placed on National Register of Historical
Places. State of New York Education Department, 1934.”
--A Dutch colonial spired church built on a fieldstone
foundation under a low fluorescent sky against a mountain
ridge.
--Oft painted door jambs, slightly askew.
--An ancient churchyard lined with weathered grey and uneven
tombstones. A faded inscription reads: “...in memory of
Effie Vei Planck Born 16 of February 1737 and Departed this
Life November...”

A hand writes in a black flecked composition notebook. We
hear what the writer writes:

TOLLER (V.O.)
I have decided to keep a journal.
Not in a word program or a digital
file, but in longhand, writing
every word out so that every
inflection of penmanship is
recorded, every word chosen,
scratched out, revised to set down
all my thoughts...

In a background an unaccompanied keyboard plays, “Pass Me Not
(O Gentle Savior).”
...and the simple events of my day
factually and without hiding
anything. When writing about
oneself, one should show no mercy.
Who are you hiding from? God?...

INT. FIRST REFORMED - SANCTUARY - DAY

--Brochures in a pamphlet rack feature an antique photo of
the church. “A Short History of Historic First Reformed.”
Tours every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 AM.
--Hands playing the keyboard.
--A framed and faded Continental Army flag “raised at the
edifice June 1774” hangs beside two glass covered bullet
holes.
--”From this spot in March 1855, Calvin Verlander escorted 16
Free People of Color to the Canadian border.”
TOLLER (V.O.)
I will keep this diary for one
year, twelve months and at the end
of that time it will be destroyed.
Shredded, then burnt. The
experiment will be over.
“Pass Me Not” draws to a finish. JOHN ELDER, 60, the steel
guitarist, steps back and takes a seat.
Wider angles reveal the nature of the sanctuary, a functional
colonial rectangle lined with white painted pews. High
stained glass windows let light in from above. The walls are
lined with memorial plaques and remembrances.

Seven PARISHIONERS stand in the pews. Three single elderly
worshippers, one middle aged couple and one younger couple. A
token turnout at best.
Reverend Toller, dressed in a collarless cassock, stands at
the pulpit. He reads from the Heidelberg Catechism:
TOLLER
“What is thy only comfort in life
and death?”
The parishioners, Psalter books in hand, join in the
response, their voices a communal mumble:
PARISHONERS
“That I with body and soul, both in
life and death, am not my own but
belong unto my faithful Savior
Jesus Christ, who with his precious
blood hath fully satisfied for all
my sins...”

Toller writes in his journal. His voice plays over the
reading of the Catechism:
TOLLER (V.O.)
These thoughts and recollections
are not so different from those I
confide to God every morning, when
it is possible, when he is
listening...

INT. FIRST REFORMED - SANCTUARY - DAY

The congregants shuffle from their pews, wait at the altar
for communion. Among them are ESTHER, 40, a well dressed
woman and MARY and MICHAEL, a working class couple in their
twenties. Michael stands at a distance as Mary awaits the
communion cup. An Older Man and Older Woman fill out the
group.
John Elder assists Toller as he offers the silver communion
plate and tray holding bread squares and wine cups.
Esther and Toller exchange looks as she accepts the wine.

5

TOLLER (V.O.)
...This journal is a form of
speaking, of communication from one
to the other, a communication which
can be achieved simply and in
repose without prostration or
abnegation. It is a form of prayer.

MEET MARY AND MICHAEL

INT. FIRST REFORMED - VESTRY - DAY

Toller removes his cassock and stole, hangs them in the
closet beside an alb (white cassock). Underneath he wears, as
he will always, a worn long sleeve black sweater and black
slacks.
John Elder counts out the collection from the offertory,
places the bills in a small lock box.
The Vestry, like the sanctuary, shows age and use. One bit of
decor contrasts with the Old New England ambience of the
room: a framed poster of the Abundant Life in Christ Church
of Fellowship, a mega church in a rural setting surrounded by
parking spaces. “We are Spirit-filled ... Non-denominational
... Evangelistic ... Welcoming.” A smiling photo of Joel
Jeffers, “Head Pastor,” a fit black 60 year-old preacher in a
dark T shirt, invites newcomers to services.
Toller stacks the communion plate it on a shelf beside the
collection plates.
ELDER
There is a leak in the men’s
restroom.
TOLLER
I fixed it.
ELDER
I was just there. It’s still
leaking. Same place. Under the hot
faucet.
TOLLER
Did you check the women’s?

ELDER
The women’s is fine. Do you want me
to call the plumber from Abundant
Life?
TOLLER
Let me have a go at it again. I
don’t like to be always asking
Abundant Life for little costs here
and there.
ELDER
They don’t mind. That’s what
they’re there for. You are totally
within your budget.

TOLLER
Still...
ELDER
Have you posted the sermon?
TOLLER
I did it this morning.
A KNOCK on the door.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
Yes?
(beat)
Come in.
MARY MENSANA, 30, seen during the service, pokes her head
into the Vestry. Behind her, MICHAEL MENSANA, 30, sits in a
pew.
MARY
Reverend?
TOLLER
Come in. Mary, right?
MARY
Mary Mensana.
TOLLER
Nice to see you again.
MARY
I wanted to talk...
John Elder excuses himself.
ELDER
I’ll be right back.

Elder exits, closing the door behind him. Mary is pregnant.
TOLLER
What is it?
MARY
I wonder if you could speak with
Michael, my husband.
TOLLER
Of course. Ask him to come in.
MARY
Not now. He’s got to go to Home
Depot and work. He’s filling in.
TOLLER
Mary, what is it?
MARY
(she sits)
I’m worried about him.
(he waits)
He’s involved with the Green planet
movement.
(Toller nods)
He was in jail in Canada. He got
out a couple of weeks ago. He just
sits at home. He doesn’t go out. I
got him to fill out a temp form for
Home Depot, so that’s good.
TOLLER
Are you sure you wouldn’t rather go
to Abundant Life? They have a staff
of counsellors who are much more
experienced-MARY
No, he won’t see them. He says they
are more like a company than a
church. He said he’d talk to you.
TOLLER
Of course. Tomorrow?
MARY
(nods)
After lunchtime.
TOLLER
I’ll come to you.
(she nods)
I’ll need your address.
(MORE)

TOLLER (CONT'D)
(nods again)
Can you tell me any more?
MARY
He applied for Compassionate
Release when he found out. He was
at Ft. Providence. They let him out
two weeks ago.
TOLLER
Found out what?
MARY
That I was pregnant.
(beat)
He says it’s wrong to bring a child
into this world.
(beat)
He wants to kill my baby.

A 19th Century brick building stands to the rear of First
Reformed. Light glows from within.
Still life tableaus:
--A single bed made with military precision
--A shelf of books, “St. Augustine’s Confessions,” “Zen and
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” “Remembrance of Things
Past,” “The Seven Story Mountain,” “Living Buddha, Living
Christ,” Guidelines for Mystical Prayer”...
--A medicine cabinet stacked with over the counter remedies:
Pepto Bismol, NyQuil, Immodium, Advil, Migrane...

INT. PARSONAGE - DEN - NIGHT

Toller writes in his journal:

TOLLER (V.O.)
I assisted Sunday the youth group
at Abundant Life. The young people
were so excited, so full of life.
They were open, they welcome
communion. Maybe I shouldn’t care
about whether people like me? Did
Jesus worry about being liked?

On his rear, he prays at his bedside.

Toller pours himself a glass of scotch, sips it. Toller’s
bed, unmade, messy, empty.
TOLLER (V.O.)
I look at the lines I last wrote
with disdain. Twelve months? Can I
keep up an exercise that long? I
read these words and see not truth
but pride.
CLOSEUP: diary.
TOLLER (V.O.)
I wish I had not used the word
pride. But I cannot cross it out.
If only I could pray.

A woman walking a dog passes. Toller parks in the drive of a
modest house, goes to the front door, rings the bell.
Mary answers the door, They speak. He enters.

Inside the house, Toller looks around as he hands Mary his
coat. A framed photo of Mary and Michael side by side hangs
by door.
MARY
Thanks for coming.
(about photos)
Our honeymoon. A bike honeymoon.
Michael Mensana joins them. He wears khakis and a checked
shirt.
MICHAEL
Ireland.
They exchange greetings.
MARY
Thanks for coming. Would you like
some coffee?
Toller is concerned about his stomach:
TOLLER
Yes, but...
MARY
I think we have some tea.
TOLLER
That would be better.
Mary heads toward the kitchen as Michael leads Toller into a
small office.

INT. MENSANA HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

They sit in the cramped space. The room is filled with books,
literature and announcements about ecological activism.
Comparative graphs and global maps show the projected
consequences of global warming: the rise of the oceans,
drought, vanishing species, migratory patterns.
Michael, uncomfortable, shifts his weight:
MICHAEL
I don’t know why Mary...
TOLLER
No reason to apologize. You’ve been
in Canada?
MICHAEL
Ft. Providence. That is in the
Mackenzie Delta, way to the north.
TOLLER
Beautiful country, I imagine.
MICHAEL
It is.
Beat.
TOLLER
Mary says things have gotten you
down.
MICHAEL
“Things?” You could say that, yes.
Mary, tapping on the door, enters with a cup of coffee and
another cup of tea. She closes the door behind her.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
Mary is pregnant.
TOLLER
I noticed. How far along is she?
MICHAEL
Twenty weeks. How old are you,
Reverend?
(beat)
TOLLER
Forty-two.
MICHAEL
Thirty-five.
(beat)
(MORE)

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
That’s how old our child will be in
2050. Five years older than I am
now. You’ll be seventy-seven. Do
you know what the world will be
like in 2050?
TOLLER
It’s hard to imagine.

MICHAEL
You think?
(Toller waits)
The world is changing fast. Right
in front of us. One third of the
natural world has been destroyed in
your lifetime. The earth’s
temperature will be three degrees
centigrade higher. Four is the
threshold.
Michael hands him a printout resting beside the keyboard:
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
...“severe, widespread, and
irreversible impacts”--when
scientists use words like that--the
National Center of Atmospheric
Research, Lawrence Livermore, the
Potsdam Institute...
Michael stands, hands Toller reports from various agencies,
speaks as he walks. A GIF plays on Michael’s computer screen:
the computer animation displays the mutating planet from 1850
to 2050--less green, less ice, more flooding, more drought,
decade by decade. Toller speaks over:
TOLLER (V.O.)
He went on for some time like that.
By 2050 sea levels two feet higher
on the East Coast. Low lying areas
underwater across the world.
Bangladesh, twenty percent loss of
land mass. Central Africa, fifty
percent reduction in crops due to
drought. The western reservoirs
dried up. Climate change refugees.
Epidemics. Extreme weather.
CLOSEUP of wall map as Toller speaks over. Chart depicts the
ecological “Nine Planetary Boundaries” which lie between
mankind and extinction. Of these four (i.e., “ocean
acidification”) have been crossed “beyond the zone of
uncertainty.” Three are within the zone of uncertainty, two
are as yet undetermined.

MICHAEL
...the bad times will begin. From
that point everything moves very
quickly. The social structure will
not bear the stress of multiple
crises. Opportunistic diseases.
Anarchy. Martial law. The tipping
point. This isn’t some distant
future. You will live to see this.
My children will experience
this...unlivability. And the
behavior it causes...this...

Toller waits until Michael pauses and sits. Michael realizes
he has begun to repeat himself.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
I thought something could be done.
I thought people would listen.
TOLLER
Mary said you would be willing to
talk to me?
MICHAEL
Yes.
TOLLER
Why is that?
MICHAEL
I respect you. I respect what
you’ve... been through.
TOLLER
Do you have thoughts of harming
yourself?
MICHAEL
No. Did Mary say that?
TOLLER
No, she didn’t.
MICHAEL
I’m not worried for myself. This
world will be what it is.
(MORE)

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
But how can you sanction bringing a
girl, for argument’s sake let’s say
my child is a girl, a child full of
hope and naive belief into a
world...when that little girl grows
to be a young woman and looks you
in the eyes and says, ‘You knew all
along, didn’t you?’ What do you say
then?
TOLLER
You say what a father has always
said. “I love you without
qualification.”

Michael responds with a sardonic smile.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
There is something growing inside
Mary. Something as surely alive as
a tree or an endangered species.
Something filled with nature’s
beauty.
You speak of
“sanctioning” this birth-- is it
really your decision? Do you have
that right? What does Mary think?
Michael doesn’t answer.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
It is her decision?
MICHAEL
Yes.
TOLLER
You’ve told her that?
(Michael nods)
So it is not about the child. Or
about Mary. It is about you and
your despair. Your lack of hope.
(beat)
Throughout history humans have
woken up in the dead of night,
confronted by blackness. The sense
that life is without meaning. The
Suffering Unto Death.
MICHAEL
But this is something new.

TOLLER
Man’s achievements have brought him
to a great place where life as we
know it may cease in the
foreseeable future. That is new.
Our powerlessness. The blackness
is not. Because we are people of
science we like to solve things. We
want rational responses. If
humankind can’t overcome its
immediate interests to ensure its
survival, that requires a rational
response. And that response is
despair.

He lets this sit a moment.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
Do you believe there is existence
apart from this...?
Gestures to indicate the material world.
MICHAEL
Yes.
TOLLER
Before us? After us?
MICHAEL
Yeah.
They continue as Toller speaks over:
TOLLER (V.O.)
I felt like I was Jacob wrestling
all night long with the angel.
Fighting in the grasp. Every
sentence, every question, every
response a mortal struggle.
Fighting for existence itself. It
was exhilarating.
Michael brings us back to the moment:
MICHAEL
...Do you believe in martyrdom,
Reverend?
TOLLER
I’m not sure what you mean.

MICHAEL
The Saints of God, the early
Christians who would not renounce
their faith, the missionaries
attacked in the jungle--do you
believe they died for a purpose?

TOLLER
I do.
MICHAEL
Every week activists are killed
protecting the environment. One
hundred and seventeen last year.
For their beliefs.
Michael points to a photo of a framed middle-aged Brazilian
couple posing in an Amazonian logging camp. Black ribbon
curtains the upper corners.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva and
his wife Maria were gunned down in
2011 in the Amazon. They protested
free cutting of the rain forest.
Dorothy Stang, 2005, a nun from
Ohio. What was the purpose of their
deaths? In 2010 the IPCC predicted
that if dramatic action was not
taken by 2015, environmental
collapse would be irreversible.
Nothing was done. It’s now 2017.
TOLLER
You said you respected me. What I’d
gone through.
MICHAEL
Yes.
TOLLER
You know my story?
MICHAEL
You were a chaplain.
TOLLER
My father taught at VMI. I
encouraged my son to enlist. It was
the family tradition. Like his
father, his grandfather. Patriotic
tradition. My wife was very
opposed. But he enlisted against
her wishes.
(MORE)

TOLLER (CONT'D)
Six months later he was killed in
Iraq. There was no moral
justification for this conflict. My
wife could not live with me after
that. Who could blame her? I left
the military. Rev Jeffers at
Abundant Life Church heard about my
situation. They offered me a
position at First Reformed. And
here I am.

Pause.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
Michael, whatever despair you feel
about bringing a child into this
world cannot equal the despair of
taking a child out of it.

MICHAEL
What was his name? Your son?
TOLLER
Joseph.
MICHAEL
That’s right.
TOLLER
The boy thrown in the well.
MICHAEL
And you were able to go on?
TOLLER
The Old Calvinists used to preach a
doctrine called the “Unforgiveable
Sin.” You don’t hear about it any
more. It was the sin against the
Holy Spirit. It was the sin against
Hope. The only sin that lies beyond
forgiveness.
(beat)
It comes down to choice. We choose
hope or despair. We cannot avoid
choosing. We are not free to not
decide. It’s what we truly are.
Courage is the solution to
despair.
(beat)
Reason offers no answers. We cannot
be certain what the future holds.
We must choose despite uncertainty.
(MORE)

TOLLER (CONT'D)
Wisdom is the ability to hold two
contradictory thoughts in your mind
simultaneously. Hope and despair. A
life without despair is a life
without hope. Holding those ideas
in your head together is life.
Itself.

Pause. The conversation is winding down. Looks at a lonely
liquor bottle:
MICHAEL
Are you a drinking man, Reverend?
He’s inviting Toller to join him.
TOLLER
It doesn’t help.
MICHAEL
No, I suppose not.
Toller finishes the last of his tea.
TOLLER
I’ll stay as long as you need me.
There’s no place I need to be.
MICHAEL
Can God forgive us? For what we
have done to this world?
TOLLER
I don’t know. Who can know the mind
of God? Perhaps we are a way
station. But we can choose. To live
the righteous life, to believe, to
forgive. Grace covers us all.
Michael looks away. Checks his watch.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
We will speak again. Promise me
that.
(Michael hesitates)
I won’t leave until you promise.
MICHAEL
Okay.
TOLLER
Tomorrow at this time. After lunch.
(Michael nods)
Are you working tomorrow?

MICHAEL
I haven’t heard.
TOLLER
So it’s a plan then. Tomorrow at
this time.
MICHAEL
Yes. It’s a plan.

Toller stands and, unsure what to do, awkwardly embraces
Michael. Michael responds.
Toller opens the door, exits, closes the door behind him.

Toller writes in his journal by incandescent light. We see
some of his words in closeup as he writes them. A glass of

TOLLER (V.O.)
I went over everything that was
said, what should have been said,
what could have been said
differently, what could have been
said better.
He takes a sip.
TOLLER (V.O.)
Despair is a form of pride. “I know
that nothing can change and I know
there is no hope.” Merton wrote
about this.

TOLLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Despair is a development of pride
so great that it chooses one’s
certitude rather than admit God is
more creative than we are. Perhaps
it’s better I didn’t say that to
him.

Toller, in his civilian clothes, speaks with a MIDDLE AGED
COUPLE and a COLLEGE STUDENT in the snowy church graveyard.
The guests hold printed pamphlets detailing the history of
First Reformed.
TOLLER
...completed in 1765 in a style we
now call Dutch Colonial by settlers
in this region with local field
stones and timber, First Reformed
took seven years to build.

The tour continues inside the sanctuary.
TOLLER
The church was partially rebuilt in
1837 following a fire. This section
was preserved. Beside the
Continental Army flag, if you look
closely, are two bullet holes fired
during what was called the Skirmish
of Snowbridge.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Do you still have services?
TOLLER
Oh yes, Sunday services are each
week at 10 am. First Reformed is
the third oldest church in
continuous operation in New York
State. In a month we will celebrate
our two hundred fiftieth
anniversary.

They stand before a breakfront near the entrance. Behind the

TOLLER
...here are examples of the
original church chinaware brought
over from the Netherlands. And the
first chalice. On the lower shelf
are souvenirs which are for sale.
Key rings, pens, postcards, caps
and T shirts, although we only have
the shirts in size S. We’re waiting
for more to come in.
The College Student reaches for a cap.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
Try it on. One size fits all.

They stand in the choir loft beside a large pipe organ. The
College Student holds a “First Reformed Snowbridge NY”

TOLLER
The pulpit was donated by William
Mercer in 1879. The church organ
which unfortunately is not working
at this time was manufactured by
A.G. Hill in England.
MIDLE-AGED MAN
Did you hear the one about the
Choir Mistress and the Minister?
TOLLER
No, I haven’t.
MIDLE-AGED MAN
She chased him around the church
and caught him by the organ.
The Middle-Aged woman elbows her husband as he laughs. Toller
responds with a polite chuckle.
TOLLER
I hadn’t heard that one.

Inside the choir rehearsal room, Esther leads a group of six
teens, three boys and three girls of mixed backgrounds,
listen as Esther leads on a capella version of “Washed in the
blood”.
“WASHED IN THE BLOOD”
“Have you been to Jesus for the
cleansing pow’r,
Are you washed in the blood of the
Lamb?”.

The teen choir members, well scrubbed and fresh faces, brim
with adolescent sexuality.
Reverend Toller slips into the room, silently nods to Esther
and takes a seat.
The youth choir joins in on the next verse. A boy in the
second row slowly moves his hand behind the back of the
attractive girl behind him, letting his fingers, in time with
the lyrics, until it gently comes to rest above the crack of
her buttocks. She quickly brushes the boy’s hand away.

Toller, touched by the melody and lyrics, cannot help also be
drawn to the garden of slender thighs, bulging crotches,
tight buttocks and pert breasts, each about to flower and
bloom.
ESTHER
Very good. Take five.
She walks over to Toller:
ESTHER (CONT’D)
A penny for your thoughts.
He snaps out of his reverie:
TOLLER
Joel wanted me to come by.
ESTHER
Nothing serious, I hope.
TOLLER
I assume not.
ESTHER
Want to have lunch?
TOLLER
I’ve got something after, but, well
sure, why not?
ESTHER
(looking at teens)
Remember that?
TOLLER
What?
ESTHER
When everything was ahead of you.
TOLLER
Try to tell them that.
ESTHER
See you then.

“Michael called into work. Wants to reschedule meeting for
tomorrow. Mary.”
Toller pockets his phone, enters the open door with the

Two SECRETARIES sit at computer terminals in the carpeted

The walls are meticulously hung with awards, commendations

Toller nods, enters JEFFERS’ OFFICE.

JOEL JEFFERS, 60, looks up. Toller enters.
JEFFERS
Rev. Toller. Good, sit down.

Matt, make those two changes.
Toller and Jeffers sit. Joel Jeffers has a charismatic
presence. Fit, caramel-skinned, graying, he wears slacks and
a blue cardigan.
JEFFERS (CONT’D)
Need water, anything?
(Toller shakes his head)
How are things at First Reformed?
TOLLER
Good. Busy. You know how it is. You
do one thing, then the next, then
it’s Sunday again.

JEFFERS
I wanted to ask about the 250th
Reconsecration. It’s right around
the corner.
TOLLER
Eight weeks.
JEFFERS
How’s it coming?
TOLLER
The invitations are being handled
by your office. We don’t have that
many seats. Your staff, the Elders
and Deacons, ecumenical
representatives, the Mayor, the
Governor--there’s no overflow room.
The sanctuary, that’s it.
JEFFERS
We’ll simulcast the ceremony here
in the main hall. That’s five
thousand seats. Have the reception
afterward in the rotunda. Is the
organ fixed?
TOLLER
They’re waiting on parts. It’s a
bigger deal than they thought.
JEFFERS
Can’t have a reconsecration without
an organ.
(pantomimes playing organ)
“A Mighty Fortress is Our God.” Do
you know Martin Luther wrote that
sitting in the outhouse. “A
Mighty”...
(grunt)
“Fortress”...
(grunt)
“Is our God.”
TOLLER
I think every seminarian knows that
story.
JEFFERS
Can’t get the image out of my mind.
Every time we play that song I look
at the congregation and know
everybody is thinking the same
thing.

They laugh.
JEFFERS (CONT’D)
Prepared your remarks yet?
TOLLER
Not yet.
JEFFERS
The memorial program comes off the
press at the end of the month.
We’re working on my address. When
we have a draft I want to run it by
you. Make sure everything is right.
Ed Balq would like to meet with us,
have a coffee.
TOLLER
Balq Industries?
JEFFERS
He thinks this is a real
opportunity. An important moment in
the history of the church, the
county. There’ll be national media.
TOLLER
Wow.
Jeffers looks at him. Joel leans forward, strikes a personal
note:
JEFFERS
How are you?
TOLLER
Fine.
JEFFERS
I mean really. It’s been a while
since we’ve spoken. Even a pastor
needs a pastor. We’re overdue for a
talk. Just you, me.
TOLLER
That would be nice.
JEFFERS
You should come around more often.
There are so many activities you
could help with. The young people
really like you. Get out of--what
do the kids call it? The museum?

TOLLER
The souvenir shop. They call it
the souvenir shop.

JEFFERS
You’re doing a great thing.
TOLLER
Thank you again for the
opportunity.

No, we thank you.

Toller starts to speaks but is stopped by a short coughing

TOLLER
It’s all about the 250th
Reconsecration. Balq wants to make
sure he gets proper credit for
underwriting it.
ESTHER
He should. First Reformed would be
a parking lot if it wasn’t for him.
Did you see the doctor?

TOLLER
I made an appointment. There was
a holdup with the insurance. The
insurance companies make it very
hard.
Esther is not quite sure this is the exact truth.
ESTHER
Well, that’s what they do. You need
someone to take care of you.
TOLLER
Esther, we tried that. I’m not made
for that.
ESTHER
For what? Love? You’re not made for
love?
TOLLER
My marriage was a failure.
ESTHER
No marriage can survive the loss of
a child.
TOLLER
Esther.
ESTHER
Is that what you think? That what
we did together was a sin? That we
trangressed?
TOLLER
I don’t believe that. I’ve seen

Some are called for their

their suffering, others are called
for their loneliness. They are

Mary works her way through stacks of junk as she reaches the
far end of the garage where a rectangular wooden box like
those used to transport Western rifles is stacked with
discarded items.
MARY (CONT’D)
I put everything back just as I
found it. I wanted you to see it
just as it was.
Mary places the objects atop the box on the concrete floor,
then opens the box itself. Toller looks inside, not sure of
what he sees.

She lifts the item inside out so that Toller can see it. It’s
immediately recognizable from news reports and Hollywood
movies.
TOLLER
An explosive vest.
MARY
A suicide vest. Other elements are
here. Batteries, detonators, tubes
of jelly.
Toller looks closer.
MARY (CONT’D)
He’s been working in the garage. He
said he was fixing a motor. I
didn’t question him. He’s been so
lonely lately I was happy he found
something that made him happy.
Toller furrows his brow. What to say?
TOLLER
Did you have any...?
MARY
No. No suspicion. Nothing like

TOLLER
Does Michael have any hint you know
about this?
MARY
No.
TOLLER

MARY
Later tonight. After closing. Ten

Okay. I will take this. This cannot

Don’t let on. Put everything back

MARY
Are you going to the police?

You don’t want that, do you?

No.
TOLLER
It wouldn’t help. It would only
make things worse. It does no good

see him tomorrow. Somehow tomorrow,
in the course of our conversation,
I will bring this up.
MARY
I’m so frightened.
TOLLER
I don’t think Michael wants to die.
I don’t think he wants to abandon
his child. He is in torment. But
there is an end to torment. He
needs support. Are you afraid of

Reverend Toller from First Reformed

you answer that, Reverend?

There are some church people, good

John Elder stands at his keyboard. Toller reads from his worn
Bible:
TOLLER
Then the Lord spoke to Job out of
the storm. He said: “Who is this
that obscures my plans with words
without knowledge? Where were you
when I laid the earth’s foundation?
Who marked off its dimensions? Who
laid its cornerstone while the
morning stars sang together and all
the angels shouted for joy?”...
TIMECUT. Mary stands beside Toller holding a plain urn
bearing Michael’s ashes.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
These surroundings were chosen by
Michael as the repository for his
physical remains. I say physical
because Michael’s spirt and
memories live on with us. As does
his mission. Michael cared about
this world. Perhaps too much.
Suffering does not hold. Is not the
last word. Resurrection has sway.
He’s gone but not his mission. It
lives on within us. Mary will lead
family and friends in the spreading
of Michael’s ashes as the Abundant
Life Youth a capella Choir sings a
song chosen by Michael.
Esther escorts the four person Youth Choir up the steps onto
the platform. They wear matching khaki pants and blue polos.
They arrange themselves, look at Esther. She blows her
register whistle, cues them to begin.

The Youth Choir performs an a capella version of Neil Young’s
“Who will stand up?”.
Mary followed by immediate family and friends walks to the
polluted creek carrying the urn. They take turns distributing
the ashes into the foul waters.
Beginning with the second version John Elder underscores the
Youth Choir. The mix of the music, harsh lyrics, barren

Office of the Chaplain. Then of
course the people from the business
community, the financial
community...

Toller, paging through the book, comes upon a two page spread
picturing all the ministers of First Reformed from colonial
times to present and their dates of service.
TOLLER (V.O.)
All those mighty men of God,
servants of the cross. Years of
service--baptisms, confessions,
funerals, sermons. The hours in
prayer, the afflictions suffered.
Did God give them strength? Did He
hear them?
Balq’s phone chimes. He looks at the message, ignores it.
JEFFERS
...Reverend Toller will introduce
me, I’ll introduce the Governor.
There will be a song selection. The
main choir will perform at Abundant
Life-BALQ
There won’t be anything political
will there?
JEFFERS
No, why would there be?
Balq picks up a fork, turns to them:
BALQ
Do you mind?
(they demur)
I ask because this was brought to
my attention.
(unfolds a sheet of paper)
It’s a print-out from a website.
He shows them a page from the Environmental Action website.
It shows a photo of Toller in his clerical robe on the
Hanstown Creek platform as Esther leads the Youth Choir. The
headline reads: “Solemn Memorial for Michael Mensana.”

BALQ (CONT’D)
Both First Reformed and
Abundant Life are mentioned by
name.
(Pause for effect)
This was a political event.
Neil Young?
Jeffers looks to Toller.
TOLLER
I was respecting the wishes of the
deceased and the widow. These were
their instructions for the memorial
service.
BALQ
At a toxic waste site with the
press in attendance?
TOLLER
The press was not notified. These
are Mensana’s friends.
BALQ
It was a political act. You and the
choir represented the Abundant Life
Church. The Hanstown Kills site, by
the way, is not even polluted. It
was cleaned up with EPA superfunds.
JEFFERS
Hanstown was not--?
BALQ
Of course not, but give me some
credit. I’m in the energy business.
It’s my business to stay informed.
JEFFERS
Sorry. Reverend Toller didn’t
understand the implications.
They turn to Toller for a response.
TOLLER
Mind if I ask a question?
BALQ
Go ahead.
TOLLER
Will God forgive us?
(Balq is confused)
Will God forgive us for what we are
doing to his creation?
(MORE)

TOLLER (CONT'D)
That was the question Michael
Mensana asked me when I visited
him.
BALQ
There’s a lot of loose talk about
environmental change.
TOLLER
There is a scientific consensus.
Ninety-seven percent of the
scientific community. The “other”
side consists of lobbyists and paid
deniers.
TOLLER (V.O.)
The man who says nothing always
seems more intelligent. Why
couldn’t I just keep silent?
BALQ
It’s a complicated subject.
TOLLER
What is the benefit? Cui bono?
Setting aside the Biblical call to
stewardship, who profits when we
soil our own nest? What is to gain?
BALQ
Could we just agree to keep
politics out of the reconsecration
service?
TOLLER
What God wants-BALQ
You know the mind of God? He spoke
to you personally, told you His
plans for earth?
(shifts tone)
Look, I understand you’re upset.
You found the body, correct?
Toller nods.
JEFFERS
How?
TOLLER
We were supposed to meet. He texted
me the location.

BALQ
And you counseled him, Reverend?
TOLLER
Yes.
BALQ
You counseled him. Then he shot
himself.
TOLLER
Yes.
His point is made.
BALQ
I think you need to step back,
Reverend. Look at your own life
before you criticize others.

Reverend Toller and Mary, bundled up, bicycle along an
idyllic rail trail converted for jogging and cycling.
She smiles. Toller downshifts, relaxes. For the moment they
seem to have left their cares behind.
TOLLER (V.O.)
Mary and I rode the rail line
trail. I had not ridden a bicycle I
think in twenty years. I was afraid
I would fall. It is amazing the
simple curative power of exercise.
It’s God given.

MARY
Thank you again. Michael and I used
to cycle twice a week. I missed it
so much.
TOLLER
It’s been a long time. I enjoyed
it. But it was under protest.
MARY
Because?
(indicates her stomach)
I asked my doctor.
TOLLER
Just the same.
MARY
Can I ask another favor?
TOLLER
What?
MARY
Would you box up Michael’s clothes?
Or find someone to do it?
TOLLER
Are you sure you want to give them
away so quickly?
MARY
Not give it away. Just box them up.
It just so difficult to be
surrounded by all those smells.
Memories.
TOLLER
I can do it.
He looks at where the vest was hidden as he closes the garage
door. They walk to the house.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
Have you decided?
MARY
The rent is paid for two months so
there’s no hurry. I’ll move in with
my sister and brother-in-law until
the baby is born.

TOLLER
You’ll relocate there?
MARY
I don’t know. She’s already
contacted an obstetrician.
TOLLER
A boy or a girl?
MARY
My next visit I’ll find out.

INT. MENSANA HOUSE - DAY

They step inside the living room.
TOLLER
Something I’ve been meaning to ask,
if it isn’t too painful.
(she nods)
Do you think he would have really
harmed someone?
MARY
He’d been involved in non violent
protests, we both had, he’d been
put in jail. He could lose his
temper, start yelling at the
police. But no, I don’t think he
was violent.
TOLLER
I just wonder if I should have done
something differently.
MARY
He did not want to live.
(Toller nods)
He was not a religious man, you
know. He didn’t care for the
church. That was me. I was the one
who asked him to come. I was raised
in the church and I’ve never been
able to quite let it go. When I’m
in a strange city I’ll just go in a
church and sit down. I was the
spiritual one.
He nods.

TOLLER

MARY
Before you go, would you pray with
me?
He appears uncertain.
MARY (CONT’D)
I find it difficult to do alone.
The words don’t come. Are you
uncomfortable with me asking that?
TOLLER
No. Of course not.
He clasps his hands, lowers his head. She follows suit.

Toller writes in his journal:
TOLLER (V.O.)
I spoke and the words came out of
my mouth. “By thy words you shall
be justified and by thy words you
shall be condemned.”
TIMECUT. Toller goes through the boxes brought back from
Michael’s garage. The explosive vest is in a box to the side.
He looks through the file boxes. Michael’s framed photo of
José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva and Maria do Espírito Santo
rests on the counter.
Toller sips a drink of scotch, grimaces. He removes a series
of paperbacks with dire titles: “Our Once and Future Planet,”
“Plants at the Margin,” “Earth under Fire.”
TIMECUT. Toller boots up Michael’s laptop. A series of icons
and documents appear on screen. He examines the files: This
Fragile Planet. Top 100 Polluters.

Environmental Deregulation. Timelines. Bhopal. Marcal River.
Arctic Melt. Ghana. Security Precautions. UN Resolutions.
Scientific Associations. An encyclopedic reservoir of
research.
Toller clicks the “Top 100 Polluters” file. A number list
appears: Monsanto. Shell. Kohle. Conoco. Balq.
He opens the folder. The first document is a Balq Industries
Quarterly Report. He opens it. A smiling photo of Edward Balq
accompanies a welcoming message.
A menu appears on screen under the title “BALQ” with
subcategories: “Domestic Divisions, International Partners,
Shell Companies, Political Contributions (est), Political
Action Groups, Charitable Contributions, Litigations, EPA &
IEC reports.”
Toller takes another drink.
TOLLER (V.O.)
I can no longer ignore my health. I
have postponed my checkup too
often. Yesterday I literally could
barely stand.
He clicks through the entries. It’s a chilling progression.
Balq Energy, through its partners and shell companies, is
under investigation on four continents. Balq is an equal
opportunity polluter.
TOLLER (V.O.)
No. I have not lost my faith.
He clicks on the Balq sub category “Charitable
Contributions.” There it is, between the ballet and the

Ten worshipers are assembled in the SANCTUARY. Mary, wearing

Reverend Toller, sitting in the first pew, takes an antiacid
from his pocket, slips it in his mouth.
TIMECUT. Toller, at the pulpit, reads from the lectern Bible.
TOLLER
“...and he said I will pull down my
barns, and build greater
and I will say to my soul, take
thine ease, eat, drink, and be
merry. But God said unto him, Thou
fool, this night thy soul shall be
required of thee. So is he that
layeth up treasure for himself, and
is not rich toward God. And he said
unto his disciples, Take no thought
for your life, what ye shall eat;
neither for the body, what ye shall
put on. The life is more than meat,
and the body is more than raiment.”
TIMECUT. John Elder speaks with Esther as they straighten the
Psalters.
ELDER
He was out most of Friday.
ESTHER
He went to Albany? For his checkup?
ELDER
I kind of asked him but he didn’t
volunteer anything. You know how he
is.
ESTHER
Perhaps I can check.
ELDER
Esther.
ESTHER

procedure with local anesthetic.
You should be able to leave by mid
afternoon.
TOLLER
That doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR
We want to check for evidence of
malignancy.
TOLLER
Cancer.
DOCTOR
It’s a possibility. Cancer is not
the fearsome medical foe it once
was.
TOLLER
What is the treatment?

DOCTOR
It depends on how advanced the
tumor is. You stated that you
have been experiencing
discomfort?
(checks records)
Six months?
(Toller nods)
Diet, medication, chemo, even
surgery. We have a variety of
diagnostic tools. Have you had
bloody stools?
TOLLER
Yes.
DOCTOR
How recently?
(no response)
I would like to schedule the
gastroscopy as soon as possible.
We have an open slot the week after
next. What is your diet?
TOLLER
I get hungry, I eat.
DOCTOR
Do you smoke?
(Toller shakes head)
Drink?
TOLLER
In moderation.
DOCTOR
That needs to end. I’m writing a
prescription that will help with
the stomach pain. I want you to

Pastor Jeffers reads from the Teleprompter:

“Refrain from anger and turn from

think that a little anxiety and
worry are simply an indication of
how wise we are yet it’s a much
better indication of how wicked we
are. Fretting arises from our
determination to have our own way.
Our Lord never worried and was
never anxious, because His purpose
was never to accomplish his own
plans but to fulfill God’s
plans...”

EXPLOSIVE VEST has been placed.
He removes the vest, examines the disconnected detonator
wires. It’s a fearsome sight.
TIMECUT. He researches types and characteristics of suicide
vests and belts. Some of the literature is in English, some
in Arabic.
There are five types of vests, some utilizing dynamite,
others Semtex, others C4. They vary in design and detonation
features.
Toller locates the vest before him: “Semtex Blocks #2. Hamas
Style.” Foil wrapped 2500 gram vertical rectangles of Semtex
attached to a Velcro belt with bungee cord and connected by
wires to a push button detonator.
He examines the vest. It’s beautiful and simple in design,
power and intent.
Web images show GIF of a suicide bomber attacks.
TIMECUT. He writes in his journal. Next to him rests a half
filled glass of scotch. He pours Pepto Bismol into the
whiskey glass. Pink viscus fluid diffuses through clear
amber. He takes a sip.

Toller enters Joel’s inner office.
JEFFERS
Close the door. Take a seat.
Jeffers sips from a plastic water bottle, lifts it as if to
say, “Want one?” Toller shakes his head. Jeffers sits.
JEFFERS (CONT’D)
We’re concerned about you.
TOLLER
Who is?
JEFFERS
How’s your health?
TOLLER
I need some more tests.
JEFFERS
You didn’t get the results?
Toller shakes his head, eyeing Jeffers. Where is he getting
his information?
JEFFERS (CONT’D)
How’s your diet? To be honest, you
don’t look so good.

TOLLER
I’ve been having some stomach
trouble.
JEFFERS
I hear you’ve been drinking.
TOLLER
Just a little wine with dinner.
JEFFERS
Wine? That’s not advisable for
a man with stomach problems.
TOLLER
I’ve got to take better care of
myself.
JEFFERS
You’re always in the Garden.
Toller: Huh?
JEFFERS (CONT’D)
Jesus wasn’t always in the Garden,
on his knees, sweating drops of
blood. No, he was on the Mount, in
the temple, in the marketplace. But
you’re always in the Garden. For
you every hour is the Darkest Hour.
Don’t confuse Post Traumatic Stress
with the Holy Agony.
TOLLER
I didn’t know I had given offense.
JEFFERS
Jesus doesn’t want our suffering.
He suffered for us. He wants
obedience and commitment.
TOLLER
But what of His creation? The
Heavens declare the glory of God.
He is everywhere present. In the
plants, the rivers, in the smallest
insect. The world is a
manifestation of God’s presence.
This is an issue where we can lead.
But what does the church say?
Nothing. The U.S. congress deny
climate change. Where were we when
these people got elected?
(MORE)

TOLLER (CONT'D)
We know who spoke for big business.
Who spoke for God?
JEFFERS
“The creation waits in eager
expectation of liberation from
bondage. The whole creation
groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now.”
TOLLER
We should pollute so God can
restore? We should sin so God can
forgive? I don’t think that’s what
the Apostle meant. We need to see
through Jesus’ eyes, see every
living thing.
JEFFERS
You don’t live in the real world.
You’re a minister in a tourist
church that no one attends. Do you
have any idea what goes into the
work of God? What it takes to
maintain a mission such as this?
The daily cost, the staffing, the
outreach? How many people we reach
each day? Who’s that priest you
like so much? Thomas Merton? He
didn’t live in the real world
either. He was a monk. He lived in
a monastery in Kentucky and wrote
books.
TOLLER
(pleading)
Somebody has to do something. The
hour is late. Earth is in the
balance.
JEFFERS
And what if this is His plan?
What if we can’t see it?
TOLLER
God would never destroy his
creation.
JEFFERS
He did once. For forty days and
forty nights.
That hangs in the air a moment. Jeffers changes tack, offers
solicitude:

JEFFERS (CONT’D)
Abundant Life is with you. We care.
This is a hard time for you. We can
help. After the reconsecration
service, you need to go to rehab or
medical institution, we’ll take
care of that. Go to Nicaragua,
preach the gospel, build houses. Do
some good in the real world. If
you’re not up to the ceremony, I
understand. You are expected but we
can say you are sick--which is true-or indisposed.
TOLLER
It’s not about the ceremony. I want
to be there. It’s two hundred and
fifty years. It’s my church. I want
to be there. I want to introduce
you.
JEFFERS
Ed Balq has decided he’d like to
make a few comments. The Governor
would introduce him. Is that a
problem?
TOLLER
Not at all.
JEFFERS
Good. We’ll get through this
reconsecration--it’s going to be
special--then we can deal with
these other issues.

You will come to Buffalo?
TOLLER
Of course. I want to see him. A new
child is the most blessed thing in
creation.
MARY
You have been a help to me.
TOLLER
Dark times will come again. But
they will also go. My great
grandfather, was an old parson. A
Saint of God. There was a two story
bank and the bank installed the
very first elevator in town. My
grandfather went with his boys on
Monday, as he did every Monday, to
deposit the church funds. He needed
to see the manager. They stepped in
the elevator. Between the first and
second floor he had a heart attack.
He wore a hat, he always had a hat.
He took off his hat, turned to his
sons and said, “Boys, take off my
shoes. I’m standing on Holy
Ground.” And he died right there.
Pause.
TOLLER (CONT’D)
I believe Michael was on Holy
Ground when he died.
She embraces him.
MARY
Thank you so much.
Heads toward door.
TOLLER
We’ll meet in Buffalo.
MARY
I’m going to stay for the
reconsecration ceremony on Sunday.

TOLLER
(darkens)
There’s no need for that.
MARY
I want to.
TOLLER
It’s not necessary.
MARY
You have been there for me. I want
to be there for you.
TOLLER
It’s not worth the effort. Just a
bunch a rich guys patting each
other on the back.
MARY
But you’re going?
TOLLER
I have to.
MARY
Then I’ll come.
TOLLER
Please. I don’t want you to. Don’t
come.

The vest, impotent, lies on the table.
He removes his black T shirt as well, revealing his pale
torso. He steps out of the kitchen.
Sounds are heard as he fetches items off screen. Toller
returns with a roll of BARBED WIRE and a can of Draino from
the bathroom.
He unrolls the spiny barbed wire, then, looking into the
mirror WRAPS it tighter and tighter around his bare torso.
The metal barbs puncture his skin, brings drops of blood to
the surface.
Toller walks to the Vestry closet, selects the alb, gingerly
places it over his shoulders. He places a white stole around
his neck, adjusts it into place.
Music is heard from within the sanctuary.
Toller steps into the kitchen, looks at himself in the
mirror. Red drops of BLOOD seep though the white alb.
He sits at the kitchen table, unscrews the Drano cap.

The camera MOVES FOR THE FIRST TIME. It dollies forward and

Toller responds to her carnal embrace in kind, devouring her,
as the camera turns and turns and until it suddenly stops.
The screen goes BLACK.
