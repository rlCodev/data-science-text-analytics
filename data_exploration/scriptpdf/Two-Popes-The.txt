Ah. Yes. I’m looking for a flight
from Rome to Lampedusa. Yes I know
I could book it on the internet.
I’ve only just moved here.
Name?

BERGOGLIO:
Bergoglio. Jorge Bergoglio.
VOICE:
Like the Pope.

Well ... yes ... in fact.

Very funny.

Title:

The Two Popes.

(All the scenes that take place in Argentina are acted in
Spanish)
EXT. VILLA 21 (2005) - DAY
A smartly-dressed boy is walking along the narrow streets of
Villa 21 - a poor area that is exploding with music, street
vendors, traffic. He struts past the astonishing murals that
decorate the walls of the area.
The boy is heading for an outdoor mass, celebrated by
Archbishop Bergoglio. As he walks along we tune into the
sermon on VO ...
BERGOGLIO (V.O.)
Once a young man - his name
was Francesco Bernadone - was
walking in the wood...

BERGOGLIO (V.O.)
Había una vez un muchacho que
caminaba por un bosque... se
llamaba Francisco Bernadone.

This fairy tale opening seems at odds with the noisy urban
surroundings but as the young man walks, we see the murals on
the wall come to life = animated illustrations of the story
we are hearing ...
On the dilapidated city wall we see this story from the life
of St. Francis begin to unfold.

2

BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
He found a chapel - a ruined
chapel ...one wall had fallen
down. So he stepped inside.
The crucifix was still on the
wall where the altar had
been. Afterwards Francesco
always said it “captivated
his senses”. It spoke to
him. It said, “Francesco
repair my Church.” Francesco
was a practical man. He said
OK, went up to the quarry on
top of Mount Subaccio, cut
stones, carted them down the
mountain and started to
repair the broken wall.

BERGOGLIO (V.O.)
... de pronto encontró una
capilla - una capilla muy
venida abajo... con todas las
paredes prácticamente
destruidas. El muchacho
entró... El crucifijo todavía
estaba ahí, en el lugar donde
había estado el altar. De
pronto, Francisco sintió como
si alguien cautivara sus
sentidos... El crucifijo le
habló y le dijo: Francisco
repara mi iglesia. Francisco
era un hombre práctico. Y
dijo “Cómo no...” Fue a la
cantera en la punta del Monte
Subaccio, cortó unas piedras,
las arrastró hasta abajo y
empezó a reconstruir las
paredes que estaban caídas.

At this point, another boy crosses the mural and we follow
him down the street and into the back of a big colorful
crowd...
EXT. VILLA 21 - OUTDOOR MASS (2005) - DAY
The crowd is the congregation of the big outdoor mass which
Bergoglio is con-celebrating with a younger priest - Pepe
(38). The story we have been listening to was Bergoglio’s
sermon. He’s finishing now ...
BERGOGLIO:
Even the longest journey has
to start somewhere. Even the
most glorious journey can
start with a mistake. So when
you feel lost, don’t worry.
That’s when God is looking
for you. And when you think
everything is broken - don’t
worry. God will not give up
on it. OK?

BERGOGLIO:
Cualquier travesía, por más
larga que sea, siempre
comienza en algún lugar.
Cualquier travesía, por más
gloriosa que sea, puede
comenzar con un error. Por
eso, cuando se sientan
perdidos, no se preocupen.
Ese es el momento en que Dios
los va a estar observando. Y
cuando piensen que todo está
perdido, no se preocupen,
Dios no se dará por vencido.
¿Entendido?

This isn’t a rhetorical question. People shout “si” back but
not loud enough.

3

OK?

BERGOGLIO:

BERGOGLIO:
¿Entendido?

Now they shout louder.
PICK UP ON the Lorenzo, who has cut through the crowd to join
a group of other well-dressed young men, all perched on top
of a slab. They’re all pals. They’re not that interested in
what Bergoglio is saying.
BERGOGLIO:
And now we come to the part
of the mass where we normally
ask Our Lady to pray for us.
But I’ve been thinking ...
we’ve got lots of troubles
here in Villa 21 so maybe
it’s not fair to leave it all
to Our Lady. Who else could
we ask to pray for us?

BERGOGLIO:
Ahora llegamos a esa parte de
la misa donde generalmente le
pedimos a Nuestra Señora que
rece por nosotros. Pero
estuve pensando... hemos
tenidos muchos problemas,
acá, en la villa 21, entonces
quizás no es justo dejar todo
en manos de Nuestra Señora...
¿A quien más le podemos pedir
que rece por nosotros?

He points to a well-dressed young man in the crowd.
BERGOGLIO:
Hombre, what’s your name?

(on edge)
Lorenzo.

YOUNG MAN:

BERGOGLIO:
The name of my team - San
Lorenzo!

BERGOGLIO:
A ver... el joven... ¿cómo te
llamás?
HOMBRE JOVEN:
(sobre la losa)
Lorenzo.
BERGOGLIO:
El nombre de mi equipo...
¡San Lorenzo!

This provokes huge, good-natured booing. In Villa 21 they
support Huracán. But the young man looks uncomfortable about
becoming the object of attention. He’s with the well-dressed
boy ...
BERGOGLIO:
San Lorenzo, pray for us.

BERGOGLIO:
San Lorenzo, reza por
nosotros.

The well-dressed young men are looking uneasy. They are drug
dealers.

Pepe and Bergoglio, making their way, people stop them to ask
for blessings or just say hi. Someone hands Bergoglio a mate.
He takes a drink and passes it on.
A woman barges through the crowd to the priests and blurts
out some news. The little bell from the local church
rings...
WOMAN:
Fathers, it’s the Pope.
Pope is dead.

The

MUJER:
Padres... el Papa... El Papa

Straight off that announcement on a street in South America,
we cut to the awesome sight of John Paul II’s body being
carried through the crowd to the Basilica.
INT. LOBBY WITH ARCHES, THE VATICAN (2005) - DAY
CARDINAL Joseph RATZINGER (77), (soft spoken, a natural
recluse) is walking along a corridor accompanied by his
trusted assistant/PA - Paolo.
Paolo has a set of flash cards - a photo on one side and some
information on the back. As they walk he shows them - card
by card - to Ratzinger, who responds by identifying the
people in the photograph - he always gets it right ...they
speak in Italian.
RATZINGER:
(of first photo).
Lula, President of Brazil.

RATZINGER:
Lula, presidente del Brasile.

PAOLO:
Correct. Seems like he is
saving the country.

PAOLO:
Giusto. Sembra che stia
salvando il paese.

RATZINGER:

Margaret Queen of Denmark ...

RATZINGER:
Margareth Regina della
Dinamarca.

Correct.

PAOLO:

RATZINGER:
Chain smokes. Illustrates
children’s books.

PAOLO:

RATZINGER:
Grande fumatrice. Illustra

Mr. Blair prime minister of
Britain, likes to be called
Tony.

RATZINGER:
Il Signore Blair primo

PAOLO:
Good. This one ...

PAOLO:
Bene. Questo...

RATZINGER:
Cardinal Arinze of Nigeria.
Many say he will be the first
African Pope.

RATZINGER:
Cardinale Arinze della
Nigeria. Molti dicono che
sarà il primo Papa Africano.

Will he be?

PAOLO:

RATZINGER:
No because we’ve already had
three. Admittedly the last
one died in the year 492 so
it’s not surprising people
have forgotten.

E lo sara’?

PAOLO:

RATZINGER:
No perché ne abbiamo già
avuiti tre. Legittimamente
l’ultimo è morto nell’anno
quattrocento novantadue,
quindi non è sorprendente che
la gente l’abbia dimenticato.

The atmosphere between Paolo and Ratzinger is warm and
familiar. Paolo has been a trusted aide for years.

RATZINGER:
I know who he is.

RATZINGER:
Lo so chi è.

A bit sharp. Paolo is quick to pick up on the mood.
PAOLO:
Perhaps we should leave the
clergy until later.

PAOLO:
Forse dovremmo lasciare il
clero per dopo (più tardi)

As they walk along the corridor, more and more officials tag
along, hoping for a word. Paolo shows another card.
RATZINGER:
Yes, yes I know who George
Bush is.

RATZINGER:
Si, si lo so chi è George
Bush.

Bergoglio struggles through the crowd towards Departures.
INT. BUENOS AIRES EZEIZA (2005) - DAY
Bergoglio is at security. He puts his bag, his belt and his
shoes into one of the trays as it goes through the scanner.
The X-Ray reveals a crucifix inside his bag.
He looks anxiously at his watch. He watches his shoes go by
on the conveyor belt.
A security guard approaches and - by instinct - Bergoglio
straightens up and puts his hands up, ready to be frisked.
SECURITY:
I was going to ask you for a
blessing your Eminence.

GUARDIA SEGURIDAD:
Disculpe... Iba a pedirle su
bendición, eminencia.

BERGOGLIO:
Oh. Right. Sure.

BERGOGLIO:
Ah... Claro... Cómo no...

He blesses the man. This attracts attention and soon 3 other
members of security are asking to be blessed.
BERGOGLIO : (CONT'D)
I think we may be causing a
little congestion. How about
if I just blessed everyone
...

BERGOGLIO (CONT’D)
Creo que si seguimos así
vamos a provocar un lío
bárbaro... ¿Qué les parece si
mejor no los bendigo a todos
juntos?

He gets up on tip-toe and blesses everyone. They say amen and
then thank you.
INT. VATICAN SECURITY ROOM (2005) - DAY
Banks of monitors and keyboards, the feeds of the cameras
that are keeping watch over the Vatican where the greatest
gathering of World leaders ever seen will take place. On the
screens we glimpse Chirac, Bush, Mandela. Ratzinger is
overseeing it all.

Ratzinger is standing in front of a mirror, practising his
sermon. He tries different intonations. He tries not looking
at his notes. He’s trying to memorise it.
RATZINGER:
None of us can ever forget
... can any of us ever forget
... we shall never forget,
never forget how on that Last
Easter Sunday of his life ...

RATZINGER:
Nessuno di noi potra’ mai

Ratzinger is in the pulpit, delivering his sermon with ease
and authority.

RATZINGER:
None of us can ever forget
how in that last Easter
Sunday of his life, the Holy
Father, marked by suffering
and visibly in pain, came one
last time to the window and
one last time gave us his
blessing ...

RATZINGER:
Nessuno di noi potra’ mai
dimenticare quell’ultima
domenica di Pasqua della sua
vita, quando il Santo Padre,
segnato visibilmente dalla
sofferenza e dal dolore,
venne un’ultima volta alla
finestra e per un’ultima
volta ci dette la sua
benedizione...

At this gathering of immensely powerful people, Ratzinger is
centre stage. He seems comfortable and capable of the role.
INSERT:
Footage of the Saint Peter Basilica - The Cardinals including Bergoglio and a few others who will meet later ranged in front of the coffin in their red robes.
End on the plain, simple coffin of John Paul II standing on
display in the midst of all this. A wind blows turning the
pages of the bible on the coffin.
EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE (2005) - DAY
As the Cardinals filter across the square, some are grabbed
for interview by TV crews, others greet old friends warmly.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST:
Having bidden farewell to the last
Pope, the cardinals will vote for
the new Pope, in a conclave, hidden
from view, behind the locked doors
of the Sistine chapel.
EXT. VATICAN PARKING LOT (2005) - DAY
One group of cardinals finds time to banter quietly on their
way in. They are Bergoglio, Turkson (warm, intellectual
Ghanaian), and Hummes (Brazilian). They banter in English the lingua franca.
BERGOGLIO:
It’ll be like the World Cup everyone will be hoping for a
beautiful game between Brazil (NODS
AT HUMMES) and Italy (NODS AT
MARTINI) but in the end the Germans
(NODS TOWARDS RATZINGER) will win
on penalties.

TURKSON:
Yes and everyone will say this is
surely Africa’s year but then Ghana
and Nigeria will crash out in the
quarter finals.
HUMMES:
I’m not sure about Brazil. I think
it might be Argentina this year ...
He nudges Bergoglio.
BERGOGLIO:
Argentina? No, no, no. I’m a
Jesuit. There’s never been a Jesuit
Pope.
TURKSON:
Exactly what we need. Something
there has never been before.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST & US TV REPORTER:
The hidden machinery of the
electoral process, unchanged since
medieval times, will soon begin in
secret. The cardinals will have a
week of discussions and meetings
before the voting. They will have
to decide between the tradition
supported by the Curia or for
reforms supported mostly by non
European cardinals.
Cardinals wearing their black cassocks are talking
everywhere. Feels like politicians. We see them in minibuses, at the dining room in Santa Marta, in the gardens, in
corridors.
INT. BATHROOM/ SISTINE CHAPEL (2005) - DAY
Ratzinger is washing his hands. He pauses. Someone is
whistling, a lovely, slow melody in the cubicle. He turns and
looks at the cubicle. Out of the cubicle comes BERGOGLIO.
They nod at each other. There is no love lost here. A moment
of pause, then Ratzinger’s diplomatic skills kick in. He asks
a politely neutral question in Latin.
RATZINGER:
What’s the name of the song
you are singing?

RATZINGER:
Quid est nomen carminis quod
cantas?

10

BERGOGLIO:
Dancing Queen

BERGOGLIO:
Regina Saltans

Ratzinger looks slightly puzzled. Bergoglio goes into detail.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
By Abba

BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
Cantant Abba

As Ratzinger leaves, Bergoglio carries on whistling.
INT. CURIA MEETING ROOM (2005) - DAY
Before the Conclave starts the Cardinals gather at the Curia
to talk to each other. Several groups are formed. It feels
like the coffee break at a corporate convention.
As they do so, they pass Ratzinger, who is deep in
conversation with the elegant, austere, conservative Arinze.
But even as he is having this philosophical discussion,
Ratzinger greets each passing cardinal by name.
RATZINGER:
We have to protect his legacy. The
truth is under siege. We need to
build strong walls around the
gospel.
ARINZE:
How many winds of change we have
known in recent decades, how many
ideological currents. We need a
voice of certainty.
Meanwhile PICK UP ON Bergoglio, he moves toward his little
group of friends. He looks up in wonder. The place is
astounding.
The radical Italian cardinal - Martini - leans over his
shoulder and mutters to him.
MARTINI:
The church is too used to this ...
to glory, to Europe. Churches that
are beautiful but empty. We’re like
a fire covered in ash. There is
still light in there but someone
needs to blow the ash away.
You?

BERGOGLIO:

11

MARTINI:
It would be better if it was
someone from outside Europe.
Is Martini lobbying Bergoglio?
Ratzinger comes to the group where Bergoglio is. He’s been
greeting all the Cardinals one by one. Turkson first.
TURKSON:
Danke für die schöne Predigt bei
der Beerdigung ...
RATZINGER:
Bitte schon. (TO HUMMES) Dom
Claudio Hummes, a vida era mais
fácil quando todos falavam Latin.
Encantado.
Hummes laughs and shakes his hand.
Bergoglio is next. He gets nothing but a handshake, barely
any eye-contact.
As they move off, Hummes says quietly to Bergoglio.
HUMMES:
No “encantado” for you.
No.

BERGOGLIO:

EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE + ARCHIVE (2005) - DAY
TV REPORTERS:
The cardinals only communication
with the outside World will be
through that chimney. White smoke
for a new Pope. Black for no
decision.
We get a close up of “THAT CHIMNEY” - a little tin stove pipe
on top of the Vatican.
Then we see news reporters from different countries all
saying the same thing in their various languages. Amusingly,
each one of them in turn points up to “that chimney” - making
the same point one after another.

It’s Black! It’s Black! So no
candidate has achieved the seventy
seven votes required for an overall
majority. We go to another vote.
Sigh of disappointment from the crowd.
INT. ST. MARTA (2005) - DAY
The cardinals are queueing at the buffet.
Pick up on Ratzinger talking to a cardinal. He’ll make the
same speech - discreetly - to one cardinal after another
during the lunch break. The dialogue is continuous, but the
lines will be repeated in four different situations. At the
buffet, seated, standing in a corner with three African
Cardinals, talking to a table full of Asian Cardinals.
RATZINGER:
We need one common point of
reference. Interpreted from many
angles yes. But one, unchanging
eternal truth. Take the traveller
who is lost. He takes out a, what?
CARDINAL:
A mobile phone?

TURKSON:
No one from the Southern Hemisphere
has had so many before. The World

(TO BERGOGLIO) You said you didn’t
want it and I believed you. And now
Martini has just asked anyone who
voted for him to vote for you
instead.
BERGOGLIO:
No. Please.
TURKSON:
(Enjoying the discomfort) The most
important qualification for any
leader is not wanting to be
leader....Plato.
HUMMES:
That’s why it must not be
Ratzinger. He really wants it.
BERGOGLIO:
Do you feel he wants it? I think
he’d rather be in peace writing in
Bavaria. Being Pope is like being a
martyr.
He looks over at Ratzinger as he says this. Ratzinger spots
the look. He knows they are talking about him. He glances at
the camera.
A bell rings and we go back to:

Now familiar shot of Vatican-watchers sighing with
disappointment.
EXT. BUS PARKING SISTINE CHAPEL (2005) - EVENING
The cardinals are filing out, ready to be shown into a
cavalcade of mini-buses.
PICK UP ON Bergoglio stepping back to let another cardinal
get on the bus ahead of him. As he does so, Arinze - who is
heading for a different mini-bus - pauses and says something
to him discreetly.
ARINZE:
Ratzinger has been here all his
life. If he was the man to change
things he would have done it by
now. I’ll join you for breakfast
tomorrow. I can bring you fifteen
votes if the conversation goes
well.
He slides off. That was the most discreet piece of lobbying
you ever saw in your life.
Hummes however saw it, through the window of the minibus. He
raises his eyes brows meaningfully at Bergoglio as he gets
in.
The busloads of cardinals move off.
INT. MINI BUS (2005) - EVENING
The bus load of cardinals - including Bergoglio - drives
round to the St. Marta. There’s a matey, male atmosphere.
Hummes, Bergoglio and others in the back of a minibus. Hummes
whispers in Bergoglio’s ear.
HUMMES:
If the conservatives are
taking you seriously... well
you’re going to have to get a
refund on your return flight,
Jorge.

INT. BEDROOMS - ST. MARTA (2005) - NIGHT
Hummes opens his room door and finds an A4 envelope on the
floor. He picks it up, frowns.
He looks down the corridor. Every one of the rooms has an
identical envelope protruding from under the door.
INT. ST. MARTA - BREAKFAST ROOM (2005) - MORNING
Hummes and Bergoglio are collecting their coffee and rolls.
Hummes is telling him what happened.
On a nearby table a group of cardinals are conversing. A
couple of them have copies of the dossier with them. Some of
them glance discretely look at Bergoglio.
HUMMES:
It’s a dossier. About you.
About your past.

HUMMES:
Es un informe. Sobre usted.
Sobre su pasado.

A look of anguish on Bergoglio’s face.
HUMMES:
You’ve got an enemy, Jorge.
Could be the government back home. The last thing
they need is to have to
pretend to be pleased to have
an Argentine pope, when he
spends all his time attacking
them for neglecting the poor.
Or it could come from the
leftwing press in Argentina,
you know they don’t like you
either. Or it could be this
lot - the Curia. You’ve got a
choice of enemies, Jorge.

HUMMES:
Usted tiene un enemigo,
Jorge. Podría ser el gobierno
de su país... Lo último que
desean es verse obligados a
fingir que les encanta tener
un papa argentino, cuando
usted no ha dejado de
atacarlos por ignorar a los
pobres. O bien podría ser el
ala izquierda de la prensa de
Argentina... Usted sabe que a
ellos tampoco les cae bien...
O podría ser alguien de
nuestro mismo grupo... La
Curia. Usted tiene enemigos
de toda clase, Jorge.

BERGOGLIO spots Arinze coming towards him, carrying his own
austere breakfast. Arinze turns on his heel, blanking him.
Bergoglio’s status has changed over night.

Back to that stove-pipe chimney but this time the chimney is

smoke.
TV REPORTERS:

of voting so...no, wait. It’s

INT. ROOM OF TEARS / VATICAN (2005) - DAY
MONTAGE of:
A) One of three VELVET RED SHOES being selected by the
ASSISTANT.
B) The SHOES being slipped onto the PAPAL FEET...
C) One of three PAPAL VESTMENTS is selected by the ASSISTANT.
D) One of three WHITE SKULL CAPS...
E) The PAPAL RING is lifted from a CRIMSON VELVET PILLOW.
TV REPORTER (V.O.)
The new Pope is taken into the
dressing room which has been known
for centuries as the Chamber of
Tears. Pope John XXIII famously
said that no one tells the new Pope
whether they are tears of joy or of
sorrow. He has to find out for
himself.
F) A SHORT RED CAPE, the MOZZETA, is selected.

19

G) The PAPAL PALLIUM, a thick red decorated band that
encircles the neck with pendants on the end, is lifted from a
frame...
H) A GOLDEN MITRE is set into the now RINGED HAND of the NEW
PONTIFF...
EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE (2005) - DAY
- the DOORS of the BALCONY open - and the red-robed
Protodeacon - ESTEVEZ - appears, flanked by two SWISS GUARDS.
One of the GUARDS swings a MICROPHONE on a pole in front of
ESTEVEZ, as the CROWD falls silent....
ESTEVEZ:
Fratelli e sorelle carissimi
(the italians roar)
Queridísimos hermanos y hermanas.
(the hispanic contingent
roars)
Bien chers frères et sœurs.
(the French roar)
Liebe Brüeder und Schwestern
(a German roar)
Dear brothers and sisters
ESTEVEZ: (CONT'D)
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum;
habemus Papam!
The CROWD ROAR, and then fall silent, awaiting the name of
the new POPE.
ESTEVEZ (CONT'D)
Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum
Dominum, Dominum Josephum Sanctae
Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem
Ratzinger, qui sibi nomen imposuit
Benedictum XVI.
ANGLE ON: The GERMAN contingent, identified by a GERMAN FLAG,
who erupt in JUBILANT JOY, jumping up and down and screaming
like football supporters.
Estevez retires and - a second later - the NEW POPE steps out
onto the BALCONY in FULL CEREMONIAL DRESS, wearing mitre. He
raises his hands and joins them above his head, as the CROWD
begin to CHANT:
CROWD
VIVA PAPA! VIVA PAPA! VIVA PAPA!

20

CLOSE ON: RATZINGER, smiling.
RATZINGER:
My dear brothers and sisters
in Christ, after the great
Pope John Paul II, the
cardinals have elected me, a
simple and humble worker in
the vineyard of the Lord. I
am consoled by the fact that
the Lord knows how to work
even with flawed instruments.

RATZINGER:
Cari fratelli e sorelle, dopo
il grande Papa Giovanni Paolo
II, i signori cardinali hanno
eletto me, un semplice e
umile lavoratore nella vigna
del Signore. Mi consola il
fatto che il Signore sa
lavorare e agire anche con
strumenti insufficienti.

REACTION CROWD: Listening, respectfully, but - seem
UNEMOTIONAL, COOL.
INT. VATICAN (2005) - EVENING
Bergoglio is talking to Hummes as they leave. We can still
hear music and cheering from outside.
CLAUDIO HUMMES:
What will you do now?

CLAUDIO HUMMES:
¿Qué piensa hacer ahora?

BERGOGLIO:
Back to Buenos Aires. Plan my
retirement.

BERGOGLIO:
Volver a Buenos Aires y
planear mi retiro.

CLAUDIO HUMMES:
I was actually asking what
you were going to do for
lunch. You’re too young to
retire.

CLAUDIO HUMMES:
En realidad le preguntaba que
pensaba hacer para el
almuerzo. Usted es demasiado
joven para retirarse.

BERGOGLIO:
The church has just voted to
make sure overdue reforms
remain overdue. I can
probably do more good as a
parish priest.

BERGOGLIO:
La Iglesia acaba de votar
para que las reformas que no
se hicieron sigan sin
hacerse... Creo que puedo
ayudar más trabajando como un
simple cura de parroquia.

EXT. BUENOS AIRES GALLERIA (2012)- SATURDAY EVENING
Bergoglio is coming out of a barbershop, having just had his
hair cut. Outside the shop is a post office kiosk.
A woman - LISABETTA - is also at the kiosk, buying stamps.
Bergoglio goes in for a bit of banter.

21

BERGOGLIO:
Don’t buy stamps from ‘Tonio.
They don’t work.

BERGOGLIO:
No le compres estampillas a
Tonio que no sirven para
nada.

TONIO:
There’s nothing wrong with my
stamps.

TONIO:
Mis estampillas no tienen
nada de malo.

BERGOGLIO:
I wrote a beautiful, elegant
letter to someone a month ago
and no reply. Sent the same
letter again, still no reply.
His stamps don’t work.

BERGOGLIO:
Escribí una carta preciosa el
mes pasado y nunca me
respondieron. La mandé de
nuevo y tampoco recibí
respuesta. Sus estampillas no
sirven.

LISABETTA:
It doesn’t matter how good
your letter is, Jorge, they
are never going to let you
play in goal for San Lorenzo.

LISABETTA:
(bromea)
No importa lo bien escrita
que esté su carta, Jorge...
nunca van a dejarlo jugar en
San Lorenzo!

Bergoglio sonríe.
LISABETTA: (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
Maybe you got the wrong
address.

LISABETTA: (CONT’D)
Talvez la mandó a la
dirección equivocada.

BERGOGLIO:
It’s quite a well-known
address.

BERGOGLIO:
Imposible... Es una dirección
bastante conocida.

LISABETTA:
Who is it?

LISABETTA:
¿A quién se la mandó?

The Pope.

BERGOGLIO:

Al Papa

BERGOGLIO:

Lisabetta gives Bergoglio a letter.
LISABETTA:
So Tonio’s stamps work. I
came to bring you this
letter. It’s from the
Vatican.

LISABETTA:
Las estampillas de Tonio si’
funcionan. Vine a traerle
esta carta. Es del Vaticano.

PICK UP.
Lisabetta and Bergoglio walk along the galeria. Bergoglio
takes the letter from the envelope and starts reading.

22

LISABETTA:
Why do you want to talk to
the pope?
PICK UP ON -

LISABETTA:
Porque quiere hablar con el
Papa?

He hasn’t yet read the letter.

BERGOGLIO:
Already booked my flight.

BERGOGLIO:
Ya reservé mi vuelo.

LISABETTA:
No. Seriously? Why? What’s so
urgent?

LISABETTA:
No. En serio?? Porqué? Qué
puede ser tan urgente?

Once again he doesn’t respond except by looking through the
letters. He’s being evasive. She guesses.

LISABETTA: (CONT’D)
You’re going to resign.

LISABETTA: (CONT’D)
Usted quiere renunciar.

He looks up.

LISABETTA: (CONT’D)
You wrote telling him and he
didn’t reply. No. Don’t. We
need you. Maybe that’s why he
didn’t reply. Maybe he can
see how much Buenos Aires
needs you.

LISABETTA: (CONT’D)
Le escribió para decírselo y
él no le contestó. No. No lo
haga. Nosotros lo
necesitamos. Tal vez por eso
no le contestó. Tal vez él
puede ver cuanto lo necesita
Buenos Aires.

BERGOGLIO:
He’d need a good telescope to
spot that from the Vatican
palace. (Skim -reading) He’s
summoned me to Rome.

BERGOGLIO:
Va a necesitar un buen
largavistas para verlo desde
el palacio del Vaticano.
(lee por encima la
carta)
Quiere verme en Roma.

LISABETTA:
Maybe he does have a
telescope.

LISABETTA:
Parece que ya se consiguió un
buen largavistas...

23

BERGOGLIO:
I booked my flights BEFORE I
was summoned.

BERGOGLIO:
Yo reservé mi vuelo antes de
recibir este citatorio.

LISABETTA:
That’s quite a coincidence.

LISABETTA:
Es una coincidencia.

BERGOGLIO:
There’s no such thing as
coincidences. We’re in God’s
hands.

BERGOGLIO:
Las coincidencias no existen.
Todos estamos en las manos de
Dios.

INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL, VATICAN (2012) - DAY
Ratzinger alone, praying in Latin, takes his HANDS FROM HIS
FACE, and finishes praying in a little side-chapel.
RATZINGER:
Domine exaudi orationem meam.
He makes a weary SIGN of the CROSS, approaches the ALTAR and,
with a CANDLE SNUFFER, SNUFFS out the flame. Oddly, the SMOKE
from the flame doesn’t rise, but drifts left and right,
meandering! Ratzinger looks upward, for the cause. He tries
to waft the smoke upwards.
EXT. /INT (2012) - NEWS REPORT
MONTAGE:

of news reports of Benedict as Pope.
NEWSREADERS:
It’s “What the Butler leaked” as
another scandal rocks the Vatican.
Word today of a new crisis as a
leaked 300 page dossier surfaces
which paints a damning picture of
the curia. Riven with factionalism,
resisting reform, malpractice by
the Vatican bank; and even sexual
misconduct among high-ranking
members of the clergy. The man who
leaked the document - the Pope’s
own personal assistant, Paolo
Gabrielle - has been arrested and
charged with theft for stealing the
document.

A) Paolo opens the door for Ratzinger at the private
entrance at the Vatican.
24

B) Paolo pours Fanta for Ratzinger as he dines with other
Cardinals.
C) We could also have a bad quality image of a priest with a
prostitute in the street at night.
D)

E)

Money.

F)

On the TV, Paolo is being lead away by some Italian
police. Off Paolo’s face we CUT TO:
EXT. BUENOS AIRES HIGHWAY TO AIRPORT (2012) - END OF DAY.
Bergoglio looks out of the bus window at the passing shanty
town.
INT. FIUMICINO - LEONARDO DA VINCI (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio’s battered shoes stroll through Arrivals. He is
wearing a black jacket and trousers, like a parish priest.
When he steps through the doors he spots a liveried driver
holding up a sign with BERGOGLIO written on it.
DRIVER:
Are you the Cardinal Archbishop of
Buenos Aires?
He is. The driver was expecting someone better dressed.
DRIVER:
Eminence ...
He offers to take Bergoglio’s bag.
BERGOGLIO:
No, no. It’s fine thanks.
EXT. FIUMICINO - LEONARDO DA VINCI (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio strolls out of the airport, stops and stares. The
car that is waiting for him is a massive Merc.
25

BERGOGLIO:
I’m guessing it’s that one?
He goes to open the front passenger door. The driver opens
the back one.
DRIVER:
Oh but Eminence ...
BERGOGLIO:
I prefer to ride up front.
INT. CAR (2012) - DAY
The car drives off.
in front of it.

As it pulls away, two motorbikes cruise

BERGOGLIO:
Did you hear the story of the time
the Pope was out in one of these
and he really wanted to drive it
himself so he persuaded the driver
to give him a go?
DRIVER:
With respect Eminence I am the
Papal driver and I don’t recall any
such incident.
BERGOGLIO:
Anyway the driver got in the back,
the Pope got behind the wheel and
he really let rip - full throttle,
way over the speed limit.
DRIVER:
Whoever told you this was not
telling you the truth.
BERGOGLIO:
So the police pull him over and he
winds the window down. The
policeman looks shocked. He radios
back to his station. He says, boss
I don’t know what to do. I just
pulled a guy over. I don’t know who
he is but he must be superimportant. Because his chauffeur is
the Pope.
The driver still hasn’t clocked that this is a joke.

26

BERGOGLIO:
It wasn’t the present Pope by the
way so ...
Suddenly it clicks and the driver bursts out laughing.
EXT. ROADS (2012) - DAY
As they drive towards the Lazio hills...
BERGOGLIO : (V.O.)
This isn’t the way to Rome.
DRIVER:
The Pope - the present Pope - is in
his Summer residence.
BERGOGLIO : (V.O.)
Oh. Summer residence. Maybe that’s
why he didn’t get my letters.
EXT. ROADS IN LAZIALE (2012) - DAY
As the car draws closer to Castel Gandolfo.
DRIVER:
Eminence, if you are meeting His
Holiness this morning he prefers to
see his bishops dressed like
bishops and his cardinals like
cardinals.
BERGOGLIO:
Really? Do you have a spare
cardinal’s hat.
The driver is taken aback but it’s just another joke.
BERGOGLIO:
It’s Ok, I do have my cassock with
me.
PICK UP ON
The big limo and outriders parked up in a lay by next to a
porqueto snack truck. Behind the truck, Bergoglio takes off
his jacket and shirt and pulls on a black cassock. Across
the lake we can see the dome of Castel Gandolfo.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
(Of the distant town) Is that it?

27

The driver nods. Bergoglio looks uneasy.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - DAY
The POPE’s Summer Retreat. The LIMO arrives and enters the
gate. Evidence everywhere of wealth, and power.
INT. POPE’S OFFICE/CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - DAY
TRACK IN on: Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict), from behind, as
he looks out of the window at the arriving Limo. A nun goes
to greet the limo and welcome the guest.
Behind him his new assistant - Roberto - is on the phone. We
can just about overhear...
ROBERTO:
Yes, His Holiness is reading
the report as we speak. Yes,
His Holiness is very much
aware. He will return to Rome
very soon.

ROBERTO:
Si’, Sua Santita’ sta
leggendo la relazione proprio
mentre parliamo. Si, Sua
Santita’ ne e’ al corrente.
Rientrera’ a Roma molto
presto.

Roberto hangs up.
RATZINGER:
Make him comfortable. I’ll
come and speak with him
shortly.

RATZINGER:
Mettetelo a suo agio. Verro’
a parlargli tra breve.

EXT. GARDEN/CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - DAY
A NUN leads Bergoglio into a stunning, formal, immaculately
manicured garden. Fountains bubble. Birds sing. Topiary casts
elegant shadows.
NUN:
His Holiness will join you shortly.
Bergoglio chooses a stone bench upon which to sit. He waits,
looks at his watch.
BERGOGLIO:
Does the Holy Father meet his
Cardinals here often?
NUN:
No. First time.
The servant returns with an umbrella.
28

BERGOGLIO:
It’s not raining.
NUN:
In Rome, one never knows what will
happen next.
The servant goes. Bergoglio looks up at the sky, takes out
his breviary and starts to pray.
INT. CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - DAY
Ratzinger is walking along the corridor accompanied by
Roberto. They are intercepted by a well-dressed Vatican
APPARATCHIK who mutters something to Roberto. He’s carrying
an iPad and showing Roberto stuff as he goes along.
ROBERTO:
Holiness ...

ROBERTO:
Santita’...

Ratzinger allows himself to be turned aside. He seems to be a
prisoner here.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - GARDEN BRIDGE (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio is still reading but now the heat is intensifying.
He checks his watch and mops his brow. He unties his shoes.
He sees a gardener from where he’s seated. He checks his
watch again, decides to go and chat to the gardener.
EXT. CASTLE GANDOLFO - GARDEN BRIDGE

- DAY

Ratzinger crosses the little bridge that leads to the garden
but can’t find Bergoglio, he sees only his suitcase on the
bench. He looks up and sees Bergoglio talking to the
gardener, marvelling at how easily he gets on with people.
RATZINGER:
(TO ROBERTO) How long has he
been here?
An hour.

ROBERTO:

RATZINGER:
He looks as though he’s lived
here all his life.

RATZINGER:
(a ROBERTO)
Da quanto tempo e’ qui?
Un’ora.

ROBERTO:

RATZINGER:
Sembra che abbia vissuto qui
tutta la vita.

29

EXT. CASTLE GANDOLFO -

HERB GARDEN - DAY

BERGOGLIO:
Is this oregano?

BERGOGLIO:
Questo e’ origano?

It is. He plucks a leaf and smells it.
BERGOGLIO:
It takes me back. My mother
swore by oregano. It made
everything taste good. It
could cure the common cold
... it could raise the dead.

BERGOGLIO:
Mi riporta nel passato. Mia
madre non poteva farne a
meno. Dava a tutto un buon
sapore. Curava il
raffreddore... poteva
resuscitare i morti.

GARDENER:
Mine was the same. Shred it
into the breadcrumbs ...

GIARDINIERE:
Anche la mia. Lo tritava nel
pangrattato...

BERGOGLIO:
I still do it that way.

BERGOGLIO:
Io lo preparo ancora cosi’.

They’re laughing and chatting when we pull back to find
Ratzinger and Roberto have now entered the garden.
Ratzinger takes a breath, smooths himself down and transforms
himself from a rattled, edgy old man into a decorous,
dignified pontiff. He seems to do this with a single breath.
He glides over to Bergoglio and greets him in Spanish.
RATZINGER:
Good morning.

RATZINGER:
Buenos días.

BERGOGLIO:
Holiness ...

BERGOGLIO:
Sanctitas...

He kisses Ratzinger’s ring and holds the umbrella so it
shades both himself and the Pope.
RATZINGER:
Last time we met we spoke
Latin.

RATZINGER:
Ultima qua convénimus
occasione, latine locuti
sumus

BERGOGLIO:
It was a very short meeting.
But please, not Latin. I was
never the student you were,
Holy Father

BERGOGLIO:
Conventus brevissimus
erat.Obsecro, non Latine.
Numquam studiosus fui ut tu,
Sancte Pater.

Ratzinger humorously agrees to slip into English. He displays
his sense of humour about the irritable cardinals.

30

RATZINGER:
Latin is useful. Especially when I
have to announce bad news to
Cardinals. Only 20% become angry as
only 20% know what I have said.
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.
I know you value punctuality.
BERGOGLIO:
It’s a beautiful afternoon. I have
my breviary. I take the last hour
as a gift of peace from you.
RATZINGER:
My last assistant - Paolo - he
would have made sure I got here on
time. He was perfect.
BERGOGLIO:
But now he’s in jail.
He knows this isn’t a sensitive comment.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
That must have been hard for you.
Ratzinger indicates the bench, inviting him to sit down. The
lake is seen behind.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
We could walk if you preferred.
RATZINGER:
That might not be wise.
Puzzling remark. He clarifies.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Your shoelaces are undone ...
Oh!

BERGOGLIO:

Instinctively he goes to hand the umbrella to Ratzinger so he
can tie his laces but Ratzinger doesn’t offer to take it.
That would be a breach of protocol. So Bergoglio is left
awkwardly trying to put down the umbrella and tie his shoes
at the same time. It’s a power play. While Bergoglio is
crouched down Ratzinger takes advantage of his discomfort.
RATZINGER:
You wrote to me asking for
permission to resign.

31

BERGOGLIO:
Oh. Yes. I have my papers with me.
He takes the papers from his jacket but when he looks up.
Ratzinger seats on the bench with the view of the lake
behind. Bergoglio catches up, now juggling papers and
umbrella.
RATZINGER:
Cardinals are not required to offer
their resignation until they’re
seventy five. Are you ill?
BERGOGLIO:
I have a problem with my lungs.
RATZINGER:
You were born with that. It’s not
really troubled you so far.
Bergoglio looks askance. Ratzinger makes a gesture for him to
seat. He does.
RATZINGER:
It’s in your file.
My file!?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
We have files on everyone. You have
no reason to feel flattered.
BERGOGLIO:
I’m not ill.
RATZINGER:
In fact you’re very active. You
walk everywhere. Sometimes use a
bicycle.
BERGOGLIO:
I also tango. Once a week.
Ratzinger is taken aback at this.
BERGOGLIO
I’m Argentinian. Football and tango
are compulsory.
RATZINGER
With ... somebody?

32

BERGOGLIO
One might look foolish if one
attempted the tango alone. So for
the sake of the dignity of my
office - yes. With someone.
RATZINGER
You have been one of my harshest
critics. There’s a lot of
competition for that title.
BERGOGLIO:
I’ve never spoken out against you.
RATZINGER:
Not directly. When I made it easier
to get permission to use the old
Tridentine mass, I was criticized
because it contains a prayer for
the conversion of the Jews.
BERGOGLIO:
I never said a word.
RATZINGER:
You invited the chief rabbi to a
public lunch.
BERGOGLIO:
Rabbi Skora and I go back a long
way. Also I’d cooked too much.
Wasting food is stealing from the
poor.
By now they have strolled into one of those decorative mazes.
Preoccupied, they take the twists and turns as they come.
RATZINGER:
You refuse to live in the official
Archbishop’s palace.
BERGOGLIO:
It’s too big for me. Too grand.
RATZINGER:
By living so simply you imply that
the rest of us are not living
simply enough.
BERGOGLIO:
Surely one can never live simply
enough.

33

RATZINGER:
On married priests ...
BERGOGLIO
I was misquoted. I said celibacy
can be a blessing but it might also
be a curse.
RATZINGER
On homosexuality ...
BERGOGLIO:
All I said was ...
RATZINGER
You were no doubt misquoted again?
BERGOGLIO:
Taken out of context.
Ratzinger stops walking and faces Bergoglio.
RATZINGER
Might I suggest you try telling
newspapers the opposite of what you
think?! Your chances of being
quoted correctly might improve!
Ratzinger seems rattled. Bergoglio composed. He smiles.
BERGOGLIO:
Yes, Holiness.
They are interrupted by a beep from the watch. Ratzinger
explains.
RATZINGER:
My doctor gave it to me. It counts
your steps and monitors your heart
beat ... He said “you are in good
shape for 86, but very bad shape
for a human being.” I believe this
was a joke.
The watch speaks again.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
I’m patronized by a watch!
BERGOGLIO:
I know how it feels to be
patronized.
Benedict gives Bergoglio a look.
34

The watch pipes up
WATCH:
Don’t stop now! Keep moving!
Bergoglio smiles. Ratzinger smiles back. They get walking.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - MAZE 1 (2012) - DAY
They walk through a maze with narrow aisles. Bergoglio is
behind Benedict but still holding the umbrella so it protects
the Pope. It’s not easy.
Again Ratzinger seems not to notice the other man’s
discomfort. They walk and talk.
RATZINGER:
You openly give the sacraments to
those who are out of communion ...
to the divorced, for instance ...
Bergoglio comes back on this, cutting the Pope off.
BERGOGLIO:
I believe the sacraments are not a
reward for the virtuous. They’re
food for the starving.
RATZINGER:
So what matters is what YOU
believe, not what the Church has
taught for hundreds of years.
EXT. CASTLE GANDOLFO, ARCH - DAY
Ratzinger walks away looking slightly self-satisfied. He’s
provoked this explosion. Bergoglio follows.
BERGOGLIO:
Mark 2.xvii - “I came to call
sinners,” as the Church has taught
for THOUSANDS of years.
They walk up

- ARCH

RATZINGER:
But if we do not draw a line ...
BERGOGLIO:
... or build a wall to separate ...

35

RATZINGER
You speak as if all walls are bad.
A house is made of walls. Strong
walls.
BERGOGLIO:
Did Jesus build walls? His face is
Mercy. The bigger the sinner, the
warmer the welcome. Mercy is the
dynamite that blows down walls.
RATZINGER
You have answers for everything.
Don’t you? You’re clever. Far too
clever.
Ratzinger walks away.
EXT. - CASTLE GANDOLFO - TEA TABLE - DAY
Ratzinger and Bergoglio are having tea.
RATZINGER:
You see my dilemma. You are
eloquent. You are popular. If I
allow you to resign, it will look
like a protest. The Church being
attacked from all sides. Why would
you want to abandon her to her
enemies? Does a shepherd run away
when the wolves appear?
BERGOGLIO:
I’m not running away. I’ll take a
parish. I’ll be a good shepherd to
its people.
RATZINGER:
Don’t you see? You were very nearly
elected Pope. If you go, that is a
criticism. The way you live is a
criticism. Your SHOES are a
criticism.
Bergoglio looks down at his shoes...
BERGOGLIO: (SMILING)
What is wrong with my shoes? They
look...

36

RATZINGER:
Do not make a joke. It’s dishonest.
I am the Pope. Have enough respect
to show me your real anger.
Bergoglio is on the back foot now.
BERGOGLIO:
Holy Father ...
RATZINGER:
If I allow someone of your standing
simply to walk away - it will look
like a protest. Is it a protest?
Bergoglio is on the spot now.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Do you think the Church is failing?
BERGOGLIO:
We are losing people. In America,
if Lapsed Catholics were a
religion, it would be the fourth
biggest one.
RATZINGER
And this is the fault of the
Church? Not of Western relativism
and permissiveness, of anything
goes?
RATZINGER:
You called the church narcissistic.
Or were you misquoted?
BERGOGLIO:
No. I did say that. It seems to me
that the Church - your Church My church?

RATZINGER

BERGOGLIO:.
OUR Church is moving in directions
I can’t condone ... or not moving
at all when the times cry out for
movement. I no longer wish to be a
salesman...
RATZINGER:
A salesman?

37

BERGOGLIO:.
For a product..
A product?

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
That I can’t with full conscience
endorse.
RATZINGER
...that you don’t believe in?
BERGOGLIO:
It’s like we don’t belong to this
world...
RATZINGER:
“A church that marries the spirit
of the age ...
BERGOGLIO:
... will be widowed in the next
age.” Yes yes I know.
RATZINGER:
When you were leader of the Jesuits
in Argentina you removed all the
books on Marxism from the library.
BERGOGLIO:
For many years I made the
seminarians wear cassocks all day even when they were working in the
vegetable patch. And I called civil
marriage for homosexuals, the
devil’s plan.
RATZINGER:
You were not unlike me.
There’s a flicker of emotion here - as though this change in
him is a personal betrayal.
I changed.

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER
No. You compromised.
BERGOGLIO:
No. I changed. It’s a different
thing.

38

Ratzinger starts to walk away from Bergoglio again. He has
had enough of semantics this morning. (“Changed” “Compromised” - Enough!)
BERGOGLIO:
Life - the life He gave us - is all
change. You are the successor of
St. Peter. St. Peter was married!
RATZINGER:
Oh, thank you for telling me. I had
no idea.
BERGOGLIO:
We didn’t ask priests to be
celibate until 12th Century.
Angels! Barely mentioned until the
fifth century then suddenly angels
are everywhere -- like pigeons!
Nothing is static in nature or in
the universe, not even God.
The Pope stops in front of a pond, turns to Bergoglio - He is
tired of all of this.
Pause.
RATZINGER:
God does not change!
BERGOGLIO:
Yes. He does. He is evolving. He
moves towards us as we...
RATZINGER:
I am the way! The truth! And the
life! Where should we find him if
He is always moving?
BERGOGLIO:
On the journey?
Ratzinger stops again. Buzz of dragonflies, insects and birds
by the pond. He flicks a fly from his face. He sees a
gardener. The gardener looks.
GARDENER 2:
Your Holiness.
Ratzinger waves to him. Smiles.
RATZINGER:
Buon Giorno.

39

The greeting made the gardener’s day.
They walk again, towards a gate.
RATZINGER
This is ego. You think you know
better.
BERGOGLIO:
I’m an Argentinian. How does an
Argentinian kill himself? He climbs
to the top of his ego and jumps
off!
This quip is supposed to thaw the ice a little. It doesn’t.
EXT. CASTLE GANDOLFO - WOODS - DAY
They move through a gate into a wooded area.
Ratzinger looks around, uneasy.
RATZINGER:
I’m not familiar with this part of
the garden...
He suddenly seems frail and elderly. Bergoglio takes his arm.
BERGOGLIO:
If there is some shade.
RATZINGER:
Yes, and perhaps we’ll find God
over there. On “the journey”! I’ll
introduce you to him.
On a dirty wild path. Walk and talk. The sound of cicadas is
suddenly shrill and deafening.
RATZINGER
We defend two thousand years of
tradition. But Bergoglio knows
better.
BERGOGLIO:
We - have spent these last years
disciplining anyone who questions
the line on birth control, divorce,
being gay.

40

BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
While our planet was being
destroyed, while inequality grew
like a cancer, we worried about
whether it was alright to say mass
in Latin, whether girls should be
allowed to be altar servers? We
built a wall around ourselves and
all the time the real danger was
inside with us.
RATZINGER
What are you talking about?
They are in a less well-kept area, with fallen branches, an
area where no one goes.
BERGOGLIO:
I think you know. We knew that
there were priests ... bishops ...
great men of the Church who preyed
on children. And what did we do?
RATZINGER:
We are addressing this. No one
could have imagined the scale, the
difficulty. From the outside, with
hindsight this seems simple but
when you are trying to lead an
organisation that has a billion
members ...
Bergoglio cuts him off.
BERGOGLIO:
We heard their confession. And
moved them on to their next parish,
where they could start all over
again.
RATZINGER:
We believed if they showed
repentance ...
BERGOGLIO:
“That it was better if nine
children suffer than if nine
million lost their faith because of
a scandal?”
RATZINGER:
No. Of course not. That’s
grotesque.

41

BERGOGLIO:
A bishop. He said it to me.
EXT. CASTLE GANDOLFO - BENCH IN THE WOODS
They are now in a little glade with a bench in it. Ratzinger
doesn’t answer but sinks down onto the bench. Bergoglio is
not sure if protocol allows him to sit too.
RATZINGER
How did you answer him?
BERGOGLIO:
I ordered him to strip the priest
of his priestly ministry, and to
initiate a canonical trial in his
tribunal. Straight away. I did not
think that a few magic words from
the priest would make everything
alright again.
RATZINGER
“Magic words”?! Is that how you
describe the sacrament of ...
BERGOGLIO:
Confession cleans the sinner’s
soul. It doesn’t help the victim.
Our whole church is in need of
forgiveness. Where is our humility?
Sin is a wound, not a stain. It
needs to be treated, healed.
Forgiveness is not enough.
The urbane, calm approach he took at first has gone. He
speaks with passion and anger.
Ratzinger responds with forensic cool.
RATZINGER
You say “we” but you mean
Ratzinger.
BERGOGLIO:
No, Father, believe me.
RATZINGER
Who was too busy defending our
teachings? Who fretted about the
words of the liturgy? I am the one
you think was to blame.

42

Father ..

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER
Your resignation is a protest
against the Holy See. And you are
asking me to ratify it.
No.

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
You say you no longer wish to be a
Cardinal Archbishop. Are you sure
you still wish to be even a priest?
Ratzinger turns on his heel and goes.
Bergoglio groans. This didn’t go well. He puts his head in
his hands.
Bergoglio walks, alone, towards the residence.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - EVENING
At the door where she greeted him earlier, the nun is waiting
holding his briefcase.
NUN:
The Holy Father has retired now
until dinner. I’m to show you your
room.
Room!?

BERGOGLIO:

INT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - CORRIDOR (2012) - EVENING
Bergoglio is following the nun along the intimidating
corridors. He’s not happy here. The nun shows him a room.
BERGOGLIO:
Thank you, sister.
NUN:
Oh. I almost forgot. A message from
your assistant in Buenos Aires ...
She hands him a piece of paper. He unfolds it, troubled.
She shows him to his room.

As he goes into his room...

43

NUN: (CONT'D)
Is it bad news, father?
INSERT: Shot of the piece of paper in his hand. It’s a
starting line up for tonight’s big San Lorenzo game.
BERGOGLIO:
I’m afraid so. Lavezzi is not in
the starting line up for Argentina
and Equador tomorrow.
PICK UP ON Bergoglio trying to pray a little later. He is
distracted by the decoration in the room - paintings of
saints surrounded by beaming baby-faced cherubim.
INT.

DINING ROOM / CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - NIGHT

Bergoglio comes downstairs. He’s lost until the same nun
spots him and summons him. She shows him to the dining room.
The nun shows him to his place. He’s surprised to see the
table is only set for one.
BERGOGLIO:
What about his Holiness?
NUN:
His Holiness eats in his room.
BERGOGLIO:
Was it something I said?
The nun titters.
NUN:
No, no. The Pope eats alone.
Why?

BERGOGLIO:

A covered plate is placed before Bergoglio.
NUN: (CONT'D)
He just prefers it that way. But he
has arranged for you both to eat
the same meal. It’s a traditional
Bavarian dish. A favorite. Just as
his Mother used to make it.
She takes the lid off the plate. Underneath is a profoundly
unappetizing Bavarian soup with noodles. Bergoglio reacts.

44

NUN:
Knoedel mit sosse.
There’s a lot of sympathy in just saying the name. Bergoglio
laughs. The nun joins in. Off their laughter we CUT TO:
INT.

PAPAL APARTMENTS (2012) - NIGHT

Ratzinger eating the same unappetizing soup, alone. He
reaches for his wine glass and fills it with ... Fanta.
We can just hear the faint echo of nun-laughter from below.
INT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - TV ROOM / MUSIC ROOM (2012) - NIGHT
The Nun shows Bergoglio into a room with a TV in it.
NUN:
After dinner sometimes he comes
here to relax.
She goes. Idly, Bergoglio picks up the TV remote and channel
flicks. He’s looking for the match ...
But an electronic voice says “Bravo”. Surprised, Bergoglio
looks up to see that Ratzinger has come in - still wearing
his white ROBES but over it now a classic BAVARIAN KNITTED
VEST.
RATZINGER:
The watch. 10000 steps. My target.
We travelled a long way this
afternoon.
BERGOGLIO:
Physically perhaps.
RATZINGER places the papers and book(s) on the table and
notices without even looking up (he misses nothing)
BERGOGLIO moving to switch off the TV.
RATZINGER:
No. Please. I know you love
football. I’ve never understood the
excitement myself.
RATZINGER looks around to find his reading glasses somewhere in the room. Walks in front of BERGOGLIO.

45

BERGOGLIO:
Not even during the World Cup? You
know, your national team, and mine,
we could be in the final together
next year. They could be - Germany a match for Argentina.
RATZINGER mouths a HARD CANDY MINT.
RATZINGER:
(disinterested)
Yeah. It’s good.
BERGOGLIO pulls out his papers, for the POPE to sign.
BERGOGLIO:
Holy Father, I want you to -- look
at my papers.
RATZINGER:
No, no, no, no BERGOGLIO:
Please, please, this is the reason
I’m here.
RATZINGER:
(firmly)
Nein!
Awkward silence.
RATZINGER:
Please. I know you like to talk but
I’m tired, I’m exhausted. I need
to rest. Sit down and just be quiet
together. Please sit. That’s
good... I get so tired. Would you
like a tea or coffee?
BERGOGLIO
No, no. I find if I drink coffee
too late at night I can’t sleep.
Me, too...

RATZINGER:

The men sit in silence for several moments. SILENCE.
RATZINGER:
You know... the hardest thing is to
listen, to hear his voice...God’s
voice.

46

BERGOGLIO:
Even for a Pope?
RATZINGER:
Maybe especially for a Pope.
Ratzinger is almost speaking to himself as he checks through
the music sheets.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
When I was young - many hundreds of
years ago - I always knew what He
wanted of me - God - What purpose
He had for me. But now, I don’t
know - perhaps I need to listen
more intently. What do you think
Cardinal Bergoglio?
They look at one another - no comment from Bergoglio.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
I don’t know. Perhaps I need a
spiritual hearing aid.
Who does knows? When I first heard
that voice - that call - God whatever that was - God’s voice. It
brought me peace. Such peace.
(pause)
You must have felt that?
BERGOGLIO:
The call yes, the peace...
FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. TANGO CLUB/ BUENOS AIRES - NIGHT
CAPTION:

1955

The opposite of peace. Tango music, laughter, bodies.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
No, I wouldn’t call it peace...
The world around us can be
chaotic...
There can be such beauty in that
movement (that chaos)...
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.) (CONT'D)
When I was a kid I started to think
about being a priest. I wasn’t sure
so my grandma said, “ask God for a
sign”. I did. Nothing. Silence.
(MORE)
47

BERGOGLIO: (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I felt abandoned. God stopped
talking to me. I stopped talking to
him. So I got on with life. I had
Amalia. I had a job. I had a
future.
Through the whirl of limbs comes the 19 year old Bergoglio
with his girlfriend - Amalia. They are superb dancers, and
their moves are replete with passion, drama, technical
prowess, códigos and yeta, and milonga, their bodies arching
away from each other but contacting at the hip. Hot stuff!
They steal the show and then move to the shadows.
AMALIA:
I don’t date bouncers.
Nothing but trouble.

AMALIA:
Yo no salgo con gente de la
noche. Sólo traen problemas.

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
I’m leaving all this behind.
Got the job at the
laboratory.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Eso ya quedó atrás. Conseguí
el trabajo en el laboratorio.

AMALIA:
Oh! So, you’re a scientist
now?!

AMALIA
Ah! Entonces ahora sos un
científico...

Correct.

BERGOGLIO:

Correcto.

BERGOGLIO:

He kisses her. She pulls back.
AMALIA:
What are you doing?

AMALIA:
¿Qué estás haciendo?

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
I’m conducting a little
experiment. In chemistry.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Un pequeño experimento de
química.

He kisses her again.
YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
I have (kiss) a theory (kiss)
that if you fuse (kiss) two
unstable elements (kiss)
something magic happens ...

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Tengo (la besa) una teoría
(la besa): si uno fusiona (la
besa) dos elementos
inestables (la besa) sucede
algo mágico...

He reaches into the top of her blouse ..
AMALIA:
Stop. What are you ...

AMALIA:
Pará... ¿Qué estás---

48

... and produces as if by magic a ring. She beams.

INT. HICKTHIER FOOD LABORATORY (1955)
Young Bergoglio hands a sheaf of papers to Esther. She scans
them.
ESTHER:
These results are the same as
last time.

ESTHER:
Son los mismos resultados de
la última vez.

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
Same experiment.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Es el mismo experimento.

She stares at him.

ESTHER:
No. I mean these are EXACTLY
the same. You haven’t re-done
the experiment. How many
times do I have to tell you,
we test, test and test again.
We live or die by facts.
Facts are ... you’ve had a
haircut.

ESTHER:
Quiero decir que son
exactamente los mismos
resultados. No repetiste el
experimento. ¿Cuántas veces
te lo tengo que decir?
Tenemos que probar, probar y
probar de nuevo... Vivimos o
morimos por los hechos. Los
hechos son--(se interrumpe, algo le
llama la atención)
Te cortaste el pelo.

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
That is a fact.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Eso es un hecho.

She undoes the top of his lab coat.
ESTHER:
And you’re wearing your best
shirt.

ESTHER:
Y te pusiste tu mejor camisa.

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
That’s also a fact.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Eso también es un hecho.

ESTHER:
You’re finally going to ask
her.

ESTHER:
¡Por fin te decidiste! ¡Le
vas a proponer casamiento!

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
Now that is speculation.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Eso es especulación.

49

ESTHER:
No. That’s deduction.

ESTHER
No. Es una deducción.

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
Well it’s incorrect. I
already asked her. Tonight
I’m going to ask her parents.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Bueno... Es incorrecta. Ya le
propuse casamiento. Esta
noche voy a hablar con sus
padres.

ESTHER:
So you finally decided that
you’re not going to be a
priest.

ESTHER:
Finalmente decidiste que no
vas a ser cura!

BERGOGLIO:
That’s a logical conclusion.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Esa es una conclusión lógica.

ESTHER:
What took you so long?

ESTHER:
Porqué tardaste tanto?

YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
I had to, you know, listen.
(He points up to Heaven) I
thought He might have other
plans for me.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Tenía que escuchar a...
(mira hacia el cielo)
... vos me entendés... Pensé
que Él tenía otros planes
para mi.

ESTHER:
The last thing this country
needs is more priests. Go.
I’ll re-do the tests. But
don’t ever try to shortchange me again. OK?

ESTHER:
Lo último que necesita este
país es otro cura. Andá. Yo
me encargo de hacer las
pruebas de nuevo... ¡Pero no
vuelvas a engatusarme nunca
más!

OK.

BERGOGLIO:

ESTHER:
And Jorge - fix your hair.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
(asintiendo)
Prometido.
ESTHER:
Y, Jorge..., arreglate ese
pelo!

EXT. FLORES BASILICA (1955) - EVENING
BERGOGLIO, dressed in his best clothes, stops to buy YELLOW
ROSES from a stall in front of the basilica.
As he passes the Church, he hears music playing. That’s odd.

50

INT. AMALIA’S BEDROOM (1955) - EVENING
AMALIA gets herself ready for JORGE, pulling on a pretty
dress. Putting on make-up. Her Mother puts a flower in
AMALIA’s HAIR, and then nods, approving, excited. She knows
what’s going on.
INT. BASILICA OF ST JOSEPH OF FLORES (1955) - NIGHT
Young Bergoglio goes into the church. It’s empty. Or so it
seems. The music stops.
Suddenly theThe Pope / Contract.
music stops and a priest crosses to the confessional. Seeing
Bergoglio he waves him into the confessional. He assumes that
that’s what Bergoglio was waiting for ...
YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
Oh. No Father. I was just ...

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Oh... No, padre... Yo sólo
estaba...

But the door of the confessional has closed. Now Bergoglio
steps inside.
PRIEST (O.S.)
Close the door.

SACERDOTE (O.S.)
Podés cerrar la puerta.

He dimly sees the profile of a priest through the lattice.
INTERCUT between - BERGOGLIO and his POV of the PRIEST
through the LATTICE - and the PRIEST’S POV of BERGOGLIO
through the LATTICE.
INT. CONFESSIONAL BOX/BASILICA OF ST JOSEPH OF FLORES (1955) NIGHT
BERGOGLIO kneels there in silence for a long moment, then
finally “blesses” himself (makes the sign of the cross). ThenBERGOGLIO:
Bless me father...
(pause)
...for I have sinned.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Bendígame padre..
(pausa)
... porque he pecado.

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
Yes my son--and how have you
sinned?

SACERDOTE:
Te escucho, hijo... ¿Qué
pecado has cometido?

BERGOGLIO becomes troubled--and falls silent again.

51

BERGOGLIO:
Father - before we start may I ask - I haven’t seen
you before. Where are you
from?

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Padre... - antes de empezar
¿puedo preguntarle algo?...
No lo había visto antes...
¿De dónde es usted?

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
Parque Patricios. I come here
to celebrate Mass here now
and then.

SACERDOTE:
De Parque Patricios, de vez
en cuando vengo a celebrar
misa aquí.

BERGOGLIO:
Before we speak ... I pray
you’re not a Huracán
supporter.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Antes de que sigamos
hablando... ya estoy rezando
para pedir que usted no sea
hincha de Huracán.

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
Your prayers are answered.
(beat)
No, I live close by, in the
priests’ home for the sick.

SACERDOTE:
Tus rezos han sido
escuchados...
(pausa)
Vivo aquí cerca... En la casa
parroquial para los enfermos.

BERGOGLIO:
You tend to the sick?

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
¿Cuida a los enfermos?

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
No. I am sick myself. I have
cancer. Leukemia.

SACERDOTE:
No... Soy uno de ellos. Tengo
cáncer. Leucemia.

BERGOGLIO:
(moved)
Then father, why are you
here?

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
(conmovido)
Entonces, padre, ¿porqué está
acá?

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
Because--when I woke this
morning at 6 o’clock, the
Lord told me to come here to
hear confession. But until
you, no-one has come, so I
suppose--he wanted me to be
here, to speak to you.

SACERDOTE:
Cuando me desperté esta
mañana a las seis, el Señor
me dijo que viniera a
confesar... Pero no vino
nadie... hasta que
llegaste... Por eso supongo
que Ël quería que viniera
para que hablara con vos.

To me?

BERGOGLIO:

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
Si. Has something been
troubling you? Your Father
wants to help you.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
¿Conmigo?
SACERDOTE:
Sí... ¿Hay algo que te anda
preocupando? Tu Padre quiere
ayudarte.

52

BERGOGLIO:
Some time ago, father. I
asked Him for a sign.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Hace un tiempo Le pedí una
señal, padre.

UNKNOWN PRIEST:
Perhaps He just gave you one.

SACERDOTE:
Quizás te la está dando
ahora.

BERGOGLIO is stunned by this news - and inside him he
experiences an epiphany UNKNOWN PRIEST:
So now--my son--whom the Lord
sees--make a full confession
and free your heart.

SACERDOTE:
Hijo... ahora que ya sabés
que el Señor te está
mirando... Podés confesarte y
liberar tu corazón.

PICK UP ON the priest giving absolution. There is a little
crucifix in the room with him. Young Bergoglio touches it as
he joins in the prayer. Then he gets up and opens the door of
the confessional onto...
CUT TO:
EXT. CORDOBA (ARGENTINA) (1955) - DAY
The confessional door opens onto a beautiful, empty
landscape. The Young Bergoglio - still in his best clothes walks out across the rocks and sand, looking up at the vast
sky and far horizon. He steps into the shadow of a great
rock. The shadow acts like a kind of doorway leading onto ..
EXT. RICOLETA (1955) - NIGHT
Young Bergoglio, holding his bunch of roses, sits waiting for
Amalia. He sees her coming towards him with her chaperone (a
girl her own age). She smiles. He smiles back. But awkwardly.
The chaperone moves aside as he walks towards her.
We pull back and watch them approach each other like two
dancers. He offers her the flowers. She takes them. They face
each other as though about to dance. But then she turns from
him and starts to walk away. He stands and watches. We are
watching the choreography of break-up. As she walks away,
she looks back one last time.
He watches as she lets the flowers drop to the floor as she
walks off. Only when she is out of sight does he turn away alone and forlorn.
CUT TO:

53

EXT. COLEGIO MAXIMO (1958) - DAY
YOUNG BERGOGLIO arrives at a seminary, followed by another
priest, where he is warmly greeted by the novice master - Fr.
JALICS - who will become important to us later.
Bergoglio?

JALICS:

¿Bergoglio?

JALICS:

BERGOGLIO:
Father ...

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Padre...

JALICS:
Welcome home.

JALICS:
Bienvenido a casa.

As Young Bergoglio steps inside the seminary ...
INT. COLEGIO MAXIMO (1958) - DAY
JALICS leads Bergoglio into the college.
They walk some steps, Jalics continues as they walk away.
JALICS:
Do you know what you are
saying No to?

JALICS:
¿Sabés a qué estás
renunciando entrando acá?

BERGOGLIO:
Yes. She even has a name.

BERGOGLIO:
Si. Mi renuncia tiene nombre,
además.

JALICS:
Love has many names. Learn to
know her by a new one.
Thinking you can live without
love, that’s a great mistake.

JALICS:
El amor tiene muchos nombres.
Aprendé a conocerla con un
nombre nuevo. Pensar que
podés vivir sin amor, es una
gran equivocación.

BERGOGLIO:
I still have San Lorenzo.

BERGOGLIO:
Todavía me queda San Lorenzo.

RATZINGER (V.O)
Have you thought what your life
would be like had that priest not
been in that confessional booth at
that moment?
BERGOGLIO (V.O)
No, I see now there was never any
alternative. That priest--that day-finding him... Even if I had passed
by, God would have found another
way to call me...
54

INT. MUSIC ROOM/CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - NIGHT
Ratzinger stares at BERGOGLIO RATZINGER:
You have such certainty.
BERGOGLIO:
Yes. And now, I’m certain He wants
me to retire...
RATZINGER:
Please. Just for this evening. I
know we have our differences, our
disagreements, but for this one
evening let us just be brothers for
a while. Shall we?
RATZINGER goes over to the piano to close the lid of the
keyboard. He closes the lid.
RATZINGER:
Do you play?
BERGOGLIO:
No. But I know you do. You made an
album. “Music from the Vatican Alma
Mater.”
RATZINGER:
That’s right, I did. Do you have a
copy?
BERGOGLIO:
Yes, yes of course.
RATZINGER:
I could sign it for you.
BERGOGLIO:
Well I’m a bit out of practice.
Let’s see. I’ll try.
RATZINGER opens the keyboard lid and sits at the piano bench.
RATZINGER:
I’ve got this little piece by my
favourite Czech -- a wonderful
lullaby. I see what I can do.
RATZINGER looks at the keyboard a moment. Then starts to
play...

55

RATZINGER:
He lived a very tragic life, you
know.
(plays)
You know the album - It was
recorded at a world famous studio
in London - I was told I should
feel honoured because The Beatles
were there - you know the Beatles?
BERGOGLIO:
Yes. I know who they are.
RATZINGER:
(laughs) Of course you do.
BERGOGLIO:
Eleanor Rigby.
Who?

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
“Eleanor Rigby.”
RATZINGER:
I don’t know BERGOGLIO:
“Yellow Submarine”
RATZINGER:
Sorry, I don’t know.
BERGOGLIO:
The album. Yellow Submarine.
RATZINGER:
That’s silly. Yellow Submarine.
That’s very funny.
RATZINGER starts playing the Schumann Traumerei RATZINGER:
Anyway, the recording was done in
London, at - I can’t remember the
name of the place - a church or
something.
BERGOGLIO
Abbey Road.
RATZINGER:
Yes, an Abbey.
56

RATZINGER starts playing the Schumann Traumerei
BERGOGLIO:
You went to Abbey Road?
RATZINGER:
Oh no. Not in person. That would
have not been appropriate.
RATZINGER switches tunes, and plays a more uptempo song You like?

RATZINGER:

RATZINGER:
It’s very different! It’s
wonderful.
RATZINGER:
It’s an old Berlin cabaret song. It
was made famous before the war by a
singer called Zara Leander.
Who?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
Zara Leander. She was Hitler’s
favorite singer. She had a deep
voice. She was Swedish.
BERGOGLIO:
Sorry, who was it?
RATZINGER:
Zara Leander. Would you like some
wine? Next door.
BERGOGLIO
Oh, si. Grazie.
BERGOGLIO exits, then returns with a DECANTER of wine.
For you?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
No, no.
(sings)
Dah, dah, dah, dee dee...
(plays)
Good wine?

57

BERGOGLIO:
Good music.
RATZINGER stops playing, closes the lid.
RATZINGER:
I am afraid at the keyboard, I am
not infallible. But I enjoy it.
RATZINGER and BERGOGLIO settle down into TWO ARM-CHAIRS in
front of the TV.
RATZINGER:
Oh well. There. I get so tired. You
know?
BERGOGLIO takes out an ENVELOPE, and a PEN and puts them down
on the coffee table.
An awkward silence follows as BERGOGLIO waits for the POPE to
pick up the PEN.
Ratzinger leans forward. Is this it? No. He only picks up the
remote from the coffee table.
RATZINGER:
A silly little program, a guilty
pleasure. Wait.
Suddenly Bergoglio is alert, excited by a possibility.
ANGLE ON: The TV, as the POPE finally gets “Kommissar Rex” on
the TV. Show the OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE, an astonishingly
cheesy German crime show, about a DOG. He hasn’t been
listening to Bergoglio - too busy with the TV.
RATZINGER
It is called “Kommissar Rex”. Do
you know it? It’s about a German
Shepherd dog that solves crimes.
What trouble he gets into each
week! Ha! Ha!
BERGOGLIO looks at his watch - anxious - then back at the
hilariously bad TV SHOW OPENING CREDITS RATZINGER
It takes my mind off things. You
know, they liken me to a dog-“God’s
Rottweiler” - that is their
nickname for me. The fierce guard
dog of the house of God.
BERGOGLIO is in mental pain about missing his football match.
58

RATZINGER
Oh. The signal is poor today.
Strange how some days it’s good,
some days it’s bad.
Bergoglio clocks this remark. Smiles to himself.
RATZINGER:
It’s a small pleasure.
BERGOGLIO:
Small pleasures are important.
RATZINGER:
I lack company. Always alone.
BERGOGLIO:
Isiah 41.x.
RATZINGER:
“Do not be afraid for I will be
with you.” Yes He’s there but He
doesn’t laugh, you know. At least I
don’t hear Him laugh. You know. No,
you don’t know. Someone like you
would not know.
Bergoglio doesn’t know how to react. Ratzinger sidesteps any
emotional response by returning to the TV.
RATZINGER:
But I mustn’t spoil your enjoyment
of the show.
LATER.
BERGOGLIO sits there, as the PROGRAM plays, but his eyes turn
to the POPE...
...who has nodded off in his CHAIR, emitting a soft snore.
Held tightly in the POPE’s hands is the REMOTE CONTROL.
BERGOGLIO checks the time on his watch, and moves toward the
sleeping POPE, carefully reaching out for the remote. The
POPE’s GRIP is too intense, and BERGOGLIO cannot prize the
REMOTE CONTROL FREE. The POPE wakes up, with a SNORT, and
immediately LAUGHS as he resumes watching the GERMAN
PROGRAM...
RATZINGER
(to BERGOGLIO)
You enjoy?

59

BERGOGLIO:
Yes of course. Thank you.
Ratzinger gets up to go to bed but before he does so, bows
his head and begins that beautiful little prayer - the Nunc
Dimitis. Bergoglio joins in.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Nunc dimittis. Let your servant
depart in peace now Lord, according
to your word..
BERGOGLIO:
(joining in the prayer) ... For my
eyes have seen your salvation which
you have prepared for all the
peoples. To be a light to lighten
the world.
RATZINGER:
God grant us a quiet night and a
perfect end. Goodnight.
Bergoglio goes to give him a big hug but Ratzinger mistakes
the gesture for an incoming handshake and they end up
awkwardly holding hands as if about to dance.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - NIGHT
The setting sun sets fire to the lovely mirror of Lake
Albano. The sky is full of stars. A shooting star crosses the
air. Feels like a Disney movie. But a telephone starts to
ring breaking the magic.
A telephone rings non stop.
INT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - DINING ROOM - MORNING
A couple of Nuns have set up a buffet breakfast. Bergoglio is
mid breakfast when Roberto swans in. In the distance a phone
is ringing non-stop.
ROBERTO:
His Holiness apologizes. He has
been called back to Rome. Urgent
business. If you could be ready as
soon as possible, Eminence. I will
arrange for your bags to be
collected.

60

BERGOGLIO:
Of course. Don’t worry about my
bags. I travel light.
But Roberto doesn’t respond. His own phone is ringing now
too.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO - MORNING
Bergoglio comes out carrying his bag.
He is intercepted by the gardener, who passes him a little
bundle of fresh oregano.
GARDENER:
I took a cutting. When you
get home you can plant it.

GIARDINIERE:
Ho preso delle talee. Quando
arrivate a casa potete
piantarle.

BERGOGLIO:
Thank you. I’ll remember you
whenever I cook with it.

BERGOGLIO:
Grazie. Mi ricordero’ di lei
ogni volta che le usero’.

Roberto comes to chivvy Bergoglio. A car is waiting.
EXT. CASTEL GANDOLFO (2012) - HELIPAD

DAY

The car pulls up. Bergoglio climbs out and stares in
amazement. A helicopter is waiting - Ratzinger already on
board.
INT. PAPAL HELICOPTER (2012) - DAY
Ratzinger indicates the head-set so that they will be able to
speak to each other.
BERGOGLIO:
I hope this urgent business is
nothing too distressing.
But Ratzinger blanks this tenderness.
RATZINGER:
The plant? Is it basil?
BERGOGLIO:
Oregano. Your gardener ...

61

RATZINGER:
Ah yes. It must be very useful,
this popularity of yours. Is there
a trick to it?
BERGOGLIO:
I try to be myself.
RATZINGER:
Hmm, when I try to be myself,
people don’t seem to like me very
much.
The helicopter takes off, swinging into the sky.
BERGOGLIO:
With regard to my resignation ...
Ratzinger points at the earphones with a “can’t hear you”
gesture.
EXT. THE VATICAN (2012) - DAY
A SWEEPING AERIAL of the VATICAN CITY and the dome of ST
PETERS.
EXT. HELIPORT (2012) - DAY
The helicopter lands - still some distance from the Vatican.
There’s a car waiting for Ratzinger.
As soon as he leaves the helicopter Ratzinger is given a fat
report. Around him stand advisers, CLERGY and non-CLERGY.
BENEDICT opens the REPORT as he is informed of its contents.
(We do not hear what weighty matters are discussed, but can
only infer that the crisis is a large one.)
ANGLE ON: Ratzinger, troubled, heavily burdened, as he
receives the BRIEFING, climbing into the car. He seems tired
as he listens to the impassioned arguments and counsel of his
Curia staff.
Bergoglio has been more or less forgotten.
Roberto appears next to him.
ROBERTO:
The Holy Father wants to finish his
conversation with you but first he
must deal with...an urgent matter.
62

BERGOGLIO:
May I know the nature of it?
ROBERTO:
When the Holy Father is ready I’ll
come and find you.
Roberto goes to the car. Bergoglio is left behind.
EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio - bag in hand - is leaving the Vatican. He runs
into a pack of opportunistic photographers and journalists.
We assume they are connected with whatever it is that has
brought Ratzinger back to Rome.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST:
Father would you care to make a
statement about the latest events?
BERGOGLIO:
The second goal was never off-side.
If the referee wasn’t blind, San
Lorenzo would be sitting on top of
the Primera today.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST:
Father, the international community
...
BERGOGLIO:
Oh! International! No worries on
that score. Argentina will
definitely qualify for the World
Cup.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST:
Do you have anything to say about
the latest scandal?
BERGOGLIO:
I’m just visiting. If you don’t
mind...what IS the latest crisis?
Rebuffed and wondering, Bergoglio moves on. The journalists
roll their eyes, thinking Bergoglio is playing them.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST:
Ok father. I know you can’t talk...
Good luck tonight...

63

EXT. STREETS - ROME (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio glances back at the mighty facade.
He walks towards the Domus Internationalis. He’s just an
ordinary man, walking through city crowds.
INT. DOMUS INTERNATIONALIS (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio is washing his socks in the sink, while watching
the TV - a report on about a scandal at the Vatican bank.
UK FEMALE NEWSREADER:
It’s the only bank in the World
where the ATM gives you
instructions in Latin. It’s the
only bank in the World - says a new
report - that operates an off-shore
tax haven from the centre of a
capital city. Tonight the Italian
government has seized tens of
millions in deposits from the
Vatican Bank. Pope Benedict has
been forced to return from Castel
Gandolfo - his summer palace - to
talk to one of the bank’s directors
- a priest - Father Scarano.
Tonight, the Vatican itself is
under siege.
Bergoglio watches as the TV plays images of Ratzinger leaving
the helicopter earlier - the very journey on which Bergoglio
was a passenger just a few hours ago.
EXT. SPORTS BAR, ROMA (2012) - NIGHT
There’s a bar with an Argentinian flag over the door and
jerseys on the wall. Bergoglio hurries towards it. He knows
it from previous trips.
INT. RATZINGER’S BEDROOM - VATICAN (2012) - NIGHT
Benedict kneeling in intense prayer in his bedroom.
CUT TO:

64

INT. SPORTS BAR ROMA (2012) - NIGHT
Argentina are playing Ecuador in the World Club qualifier.
Everyone is cheering. Argentina has scored. Bergoglio turns
to his fellow fans.
BERGOGLIO:
You prayed for it to go in.
You should give thanks that
it did.

BERGOGLIO:
Ya que rezaron para que meta
el gol... ¡Ahora deberían
agradecer que lo metió!

There’s a grudging acknowledgement of this logic.
BERGOGLIO:
Thank you Lord for the gift
of El Pipita.
Amen.

FAN:

BERGOGLIO:
Gracias Señor por el talento
de El Pipita.
Amen

FAN:

BERGOGLIO:
Help to keep his temper.

BERGOGLIO:
Te pedimos que lo ayudes a
controlar su carácter.

FAN:
Amen. Double amen.

FAN:
Amen. Doble Amen.

BERGOGLIO:
Also, God bless our Pope.

BERGOGLIO:
Que Dios bendiga a nuestro
Papa también

One fan immediately object to this.
FAN:
This Pope?! The German. No,
no, no. Let him bless
himself.

FAN:
¿Este papa? El alemán.
No,no,no! Que él se bendiga
solo.

Bergoglio is taken aback by the popular dislike for
Ratzinger. On the TV the commentator is becoming excited.
Another goal maybe. Everyone turns back to the TV. But
Bergoglio has lost his sociability. He stands at one remove.
INT. RATZINGER'S BEDROOM - VATICAN (2012) - NIGHT
Back to Ratzinger praying. This time we hear his prayer. It’s
the Nunc Dimittis in Latin.
RATZINGER:
Nunc dimittis servum tuum, Domine,
secundum verbum tuum in pace.

65

BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Let your servant depart in
peace now Lord, according to
your word.

BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Ahora, Señor, según tu
promesa, puedes dejar a tu
siervo irse en paz

INT. DOMUS INTERNATIONALIS BEDROOM (2012) - NIGHT
Bergoglio saying HIS prayers. He’s praying for Ratzinger.
BERGOGLIO:
God grant him a quiet night
and a perfect end.

BERGOGLIO:
Que Dios le conceda una noche
serena y un final feliz.

INSERT: The sun comes up over Rome. Big stone pines
silhouetted against a red sky.
INT. CORRIDOR VATICAN (2012) - EARLY MORNING
Roberto almost runs along the corridor. His phone keeps
buzzing. He keeps having to reject calls.
PICK UP ON him talking to Ratzinger who is being dressed by
his dresser. Ratzinger is still in his underwear - his
unusually lengthy underpants and long socks look slightly
comic.
RATZINGER:
What do you mean he’s not
here?

RATZINGER:
Che vuol dire con non e’ qui?

ROBERTO:
I ... we can’t find him.

ROBERTO:
Io... Non lo troviamo.

RATZINGER:
(frantic) What room did you
give him?

RATZINGER:
(Agitato)
Quale stanza gli avete dato?

ROBERTO:
I assumed, as a Jesuit, he
would be staying in the
Jesuit mother house.

ROBERTO:
Ho dato per scontato, che
come gesuita, avrebbe
alloggiato alla Casa Professa
dei Gesuiti.

RATZINGER:
He hasn’t stayed there for
years. He has a problematic
relationship with the order.

RATZINGER:
Non alloggia li’ da anni. Ha
un rapporto difficile con
l’ordine.
CUT TO:

66

INT. VATICAN SECURITY ROOM - DAY
The Head of Security listens to Roberto who is looking for
Bergoglio. He turns and gives an order to someone next to
him. (improvised)
EXT. ST PETER’S SQUARE - DAY
A Swiss Guard standing in front of the gate at Paolo VI
listens to the walkie-talkie and looks around.
EXT. VATICAN - PAOLO VI (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio - bag in hand - walking back towards the Vatican.
There are still hordes of journalists and TV crews. A
journalist approaches him with a microphone. Bergoglio
doesn’t stop walking. The journalist follows him.
PRESS:
Holiness do you have anything to
say about the arrest of Father
Scarano?
BERGOGLIO:
What do you want me to say?
PRESS:
Will the Vatican be contesting it?
BERGOGLIO:
What? No. It’s not like he’s been
arrested for praying too many
rosaries! I can’t give a statement,
but I can give you a blessing.
Swiss guard interrupts the interview.
SWISS GUARD:
Cardinal! Emminence ...
He leads Bergoglio by the elbow towards the entrance. He
talks into his walkie-talkie, saying he’s found him.
INT. VATICAN STAIRS (2012) - DAY
The young Swiss Guard - in his fabulous uniform is now
leading Bergoglio silently up the big stairs..
BERGOGLIO:
I’ve always wondered ... the
uniform, is it comfortable?
67

No response.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
It can’t be easy to keep clean.
Maybe someone else cleans it?
They come to a door in the middle of the stairs. The Guard
stands back to let Bergoglio pass through it but as Bergoglio
is about to pass him, he says quietly ...
SWISS GUARD:
It’s not comfortable. But it is
based on a painting by Michelangelo
so...I’m a work of art.
They go up the stairs that feel like back-stage.
BERGOGLIO:
You won’t be a work of art forever.
SWISS GUARD:
I’m a student. Economics.
BERGOGLIO:
Ah! Economics...
SWISS GUARD:
Eminence, what you said about the
trickle-down theory of wealth
creation...
BERGOGLIO:
That nothing trickles down but
humiliation and suffering?
SWISS GUARD:
I quoted it in my dissertation.
BERGOGLIO:
Did you get a good mark?
A-star.

SWISS GUARD:

BERGOGLIO:
Good work. When you finish your
studies ... don’t be a banker.
The Swiss Guard opens a door.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT’D)
That’s where we’re meeting?

68

SWISS GUARD:
I don’t know. I was just asked to
bring you here.
Thank you.

BERGOGLIO:

Bergoglio goes through the door into ...
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
The Sistine Chapel - so vivid, so alive. It’s heartstopping. Bergoglio stops to take it all in. Walks towards
the altar.
Bergoglio considers the Last Judgement all alone.
CLOSE ON: His old BLACK SHOES as he crosses the marble floor.
He stops at the huge end-panel, with its rendering of HEAVEN
and HELL, the ANGELS hauling up to heaven those souls in
hellish torment - a powerful depiction of SIN.
A door opens. A figure appears. It’s Ratzinger. The POPE
walks to BERGOGLIO, whose heart begins to pound, such is the
drama of the setting.
RATZINGER:
I’ve never been in here when it was
empty before. I wanted to share the
moment with you.
They both stand looking up at it, marvelling.
BERGOGLIO:
If I was Pope I’d be in here every
day.
What else?
What?

RATZINGER:
BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
If you had been chosen. What else
would you do?
BERGOGLIO:
Holy Father ...
RATZINGER:
This place would be different, I
think.
69

BERGOGLIO:
I wouldn’t eat alone for a start.
Apart from the theology, it’s not
good for you.
Ratzinger nods - noticing the concern as well as the
ideology.
BERGOGLIO:
All through the gospels Jesus is
always breaking bread, feeding the
people. Even after he came back
from the dead he barbecued fish on
the shore of Lake Galilee ...
He’s describing some of the scenes from the frescoes.
What else?

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
I’d sort out the bank.
RATZINGER:
Good luck with that.
Ratzinger laughs.

Bergoglio is thrown.

BERGOGLIO:
The banks almost destroyed my
country. They beg for deregulation
like tigers pleading to be let out
of their cages. They devour
everything in sight.
RATZINGER:
The Curia’s a machine. You put your
hand inside, it chops it into
mincemeat. It protects itself. To
become Pope is to become breakfast.
Ratzinger sounds exhausted and bitter.
Bergoglio looks and walks towards the Ghirlandaio fresco of
the Vocation of the Apostles (it shows Christ on a beach with
fishermen).
BERGOGLIO:
The only way to follow Him is to be
where He is. Where is He? Right
now? In the bomb craters in Syria.
On the little beaches welcoming
refugees. At Lampedusa. In
hospitals...
(MORE)
70

BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
(referring to the chapel)
Not here... see?... You’re
beginning to be glad I’m resigning.
RATZINGER:
For weeks, I’ve been praying for a
sign.
BERGOGLIO:
I don’t understand.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - (PART 2) - DAY
They’re now seated on the marble bench against the curtain.
RATZINGER:
When your request to resign came I
knew I couldn’t accept it without
speaking to you. You had to come
here. But perhaps you had to come
here for some other purpose.
Like what?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
I have made a decision about
something. A decision of great
importance for the life of the
whole Church. For her future.
Something I ask you to hide in your
soul, and speak of to no-one.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Sometimes you notice little things.
The other night after prayers I
blew out the candle. Instead of
rising up, the smoke went down.
Like Cain’s offering. Do you notice
such things?
BERGOGLIO:
I bought the tickets for my flight
here before you requested my
presence.
Ratzinger looks up at this. It’s as though it’s a clincher
for him.
RATZINGER:
No! Really? That gives me
encouragement. You are the right
person. I’m going to resign.
71

He’s thrown this last sentence away so casually that
Bergoglio doesn’t notice it at first.
BERGOGLIO:
The right person for what?
RATZINGER:
To tell. I need to say it out loud
to someone first.
Say what?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
What I just said. I’m going to
resign.
BERGOGLIO:
Resign from what?
RATZINGER:
The Papacy. The Chair of St Peter.
The Bishopric of Rome. I’m going to
renounce them all.
BERGOGLIO:
But then...I mean...you can’t. If
you did that, you wouldn’t be Pope
any more.
Yes

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
But you are the Pope...
Yes.

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
Popes can’t resign.
RATZINGER:
In fact it’s not without precedent.
Celestine V did it in 1294.
Ratzinger is not comfortable on the marble bench. He looks to
a security guard’s cloth chair in the corner of the chapel.
BERGOGLIO:
Holy Father...You think people will
not be shocked because this
happened once before...seven
hundred years ago!
72

Ratzinger stands up and goes to grab a chair.
RATZINGER:
The marble is too cold.
BERGOGLIO:
I can’t breathe... I came here just
to ask for your signature on a
piece of paper.
On his way to the chair he points to the door on the opposite
side of the chapel, as if saying: “get that other chair for
you”. Bergoglio goes.
RATZINGER:
Now you know why I couldn’t give
you that. There will be another
conclave. It is important that you
are there.
BERGOGLIO:
But, Holy Father, you cannot do
this. You must not! Why do the
Presidents of America and Russia,
of China, all come to you? Because,
unlike them, your authority derives
from the fact you will suffer and
die on the job. A Pope represents
service - life long - until death! a martyr for justice and truth. For
this all people come. Forgive me
but...
But?

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
... Christ did not come down from
his cross.
Ratzinger is stung. But also reflective, almost wondering.
RATZINGER:
God always grants you the right
words.
BERGOGLIO
The Pope must go on, to the end.
Be the personification of the
crucified Christ! If you resign you
will damage the prestige of the
papacy forever.
They are now seated facing each other.
73

Ratzinger seems to think this over before replying.
RATZINGER:
And what damage will I do if I
remain?
BERGOGLIO registers this point But his thoughts flee and regroup like flocks of starlings.
BERGOGLIO:
I can’t understand how this
conversation is happening. The last
time anyone discussed a thing like
this, these frescoes weren’t
painted. Two Popes? Unthinkable.
RATZINGER:
In 1978 we had three.
BERGOGLIO:
Not at the same time!
RATZINGER:
I was making a little joke.
A joke?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
A German joke. It doesn’t have to
be funny.
BERGOGLIO:
What would we call you?
RATZINGER:
Father Ratzinger? Brother
Joseph?...
German humour again? Ratzinger comes up with a name:
RATZINGER: (CONT’D)
Pope Emeritus? Would that work?
BERGOGLIO:
Two Popes. Both commanding
authority.
RATZINGER:
Only one would command authority.
I would hide away...out of the spotlight. Silence incarnate!
“Silentium Incarnatum”
74

BERGOGLIO:
Even if you are never seen or heard
again, you will still exist.
RATZINGER:
For a while at any rate.
BERGOGLIO:
But your views, very well known
views, will exist. And therefore
will have authority still! Could
you accept that?
RATZINGER:
There’s a saying - the Lord
corrects one Pope by giving us the
next. I’d like to see my
correction.
BERGOGLIO throws up his hands BERGOGLIO:
Where would you live?
RATZINGER:
I’ll find somewhere. I would keep
out of your way.
“My” way?!

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
Possibly. I think it has to be a
possibility ...
Bergoglio isn’t going to have that conversation.
BERGOGLIO
Are you being pressured to go? The
Curia?
RATZINGER:
If there was pressure from there, I
would resist it. I know my reasons
are pure.
The Pope stares, neither confirms or denies this RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
I’m a scholar not a manager--I have
a pace-maker and can no longer see
out of my left eye. Governance
requires eyes I don’t have.
(MORE)
75

RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
I have fought and fought to do what
needs to be done. But I have lost.
BERGOGLIO is amazed to see the POPE humble himself like this.
Ratzinger’s watch beeps. “-Time to walk””. Ratzinger stands
up and starts walking towards the entrance of the chapel. He
doesn’t need to explain anything.
Bergoglio follows Ratzinger and they both walk and talk back
and forth in the Sistine Chapel as if it was a gym.
BERGOGLIO:
It is our weakness that calls forth
the grace of god. When we offer our
weakness, He gives us strength.
RATZINGER:
I’ve answered your question... Be
satisfied.
BERGOGLIO
With respect, Holiness, it’s not I
who has to be satisfied. It’s 1.2
billion believers. They will need
to know why. Otherwise they will
think there is some scandal, some
plot...
Ratzinger goes quiet. Maybe there IS some mystery?
RATZINGER:
That is the calculation of
leadership. A calculation we must
both make.
Both? Why?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
For weeks I have been praying. I
wanted to resign. But the thought
that stopped me - what if at the
next conclave, they voted for you.
BERGOGLIO:
Then I offered my resignation.
RATZINGER:
Exactly. And I was delighted. One
reason I didn’t want to resign
was...what if you were next.
This is only half in jest. Bergoglio smiles.
76

RATZINGER: (CONT’D)
And so you came. And now I’ve
changed.
BERGOGLIO:
You compromised.
RATZINGER:
No. I’ve changed. It’s a different
thing. Your approach, your style is
radically different from mine. And
I don’t agree with most things you
say and do...
BERGOGLIO smiles RATZINGER
But now I can see a necessity for
Bergoglio. I cannot do this without
knowing that there is at least a
possibility that you might be
chosen.
BERGOGLIO:
No. Father, I could never...not me.
RATZINGER:
We both know, in our hearts, that
it could be. The Church needs
change and you could be that
change.
BERGOGLIO:
Not, not me, never. It could not be
me.
Why not?

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
You know why...
RATZINGER:
I’ve read your files.
BERGOGLIO:
(emphatic)
The files are incomplete.
FLASHBACK TO:

INT. CONFESSIONAL - BASILICA DE FLORES (1955) - NIGHT
We’re back in 1955 with the young Bergoglio in the
confessional, as we saw before.
YOUNG BERGOGLIO:
Bless me father for I have
sinned.

JOVEN BERGOGLIO:
Bendíceme padre porque he
pecado...

PRIEST:
Go now and sin no more ...

SACERDOTE:
Podés irte y en adelante no
vuelvas a pecar.

Young Bergoglio opens the door of the confessional but - as

difíciles de su historia
Presence of military on the streets.
Civilians are violently approached. Cars are stopped and
checked.
BERGOGLIO (V.O.)
In the 70’s, the government was
overthrown by a military
dictatorship. At that time, I
became the head of the Jesuit
priests in Argentina.

78

DURING A MASS, BERGOGLIO IS PLACING COMMUNION WAFERS ON THE
TONGUES OF THE CONGREGATION WHO FILE FORWARD AND OPEN THEIR
MOUTHS...
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Everybody was a suspect. 30,000
people were killed. Anyone who
disagreed, disappeared. Esther, my
old boss, my friend, her daughter
was among them.
INSERT ARCHIVE of MUGICA’S speech:
PADRE MUGICA:
No se trata más que de restituir al
pueblo, lo que al pueblo le
corresponde. Todo ser humano en una
sociedad civilizada en la cual se
aplique los principios de Jesus
Cristo, tiene que tener derecho a
su trabajo.
Fr. MUGICA - is gunned down outside his church.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Many priests were seen as
supporters of the armed resistance.
Father Mugica, the voice of the
poor in Argentina was martyred in
1974... After him many priests and
nuns were killed.
The body of a PRIEST is thrown on to the train tracks.
Another PRIEST is shot. The DEATH SQUAD then drive away.
BERGOGLIO:
This is not a time I am proud of,
father.
A nun is dragged, about to be thrown from a military plane.
Bergoglio is being presented to Massera in the lobby of his
headquarters. He sees Astiz.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
I felt my job was to make sure my
priests were safe.
So I talked to Admiral Massera, one
of the leaders of the Junta. I
tried to reason with him, to
compromise.

EXT. PLAZA DE MAYO (1977) - DAY
Footage of disappeared and the mothers of Plaza de Mayo.
Esther is in the crowd being interviewed.
ESTHER:
Somos Argentinas, vivimos en
Argentina, lo que podemos asegurar
es que hay miles y miles de madres
sufriendo mucha angustia, mucho
dolor, mucha desesperación. Sólo
queremos saber dónde están nuestros
hijos. Vivos o muertos.
INSERT (ARCHIVE):
VIDELA:
"There’s no way we can deal with
the disappeared because they
disappeared."
INT. ESTHER’S HOUSE (1977) - DAY
Esther and Bergoglio are having an argument. Esther’s flat is
a typical activist’s home - full of books and leaflets.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Esther was an atheist, a Marxist.
Before the dictatorship that didn’t
matter. Now she thought I was the
enemy.
Bergoglio selects the books and put them on a card box,
Esther just watches.
ESTHER:
All of them?

Todos?

ESTHER:

BERGOGLIO:
No, this one can stay, the
rest I’ll take with me.

BERGOGLIO:
No, éste se puede quedar, el
resto me los llevo.

ESTHER:
How do you know that they are
watching me?

ESTHER:
Como sabés que me están
vigilando?

Bergoglio opens a news paper in which Astiz is seen among the
mothers protesting.
Esther’s face turns ashen white. She looks as though she has
been hit.

80

BERGOGLIO:
This man who “speaks out”
with you. His name is Astiz.
Personal friend of Admiral
Massera. They call him the
Blonde Angel of Death. That’s
why I’m here. To warn you.
He’s an informer.

BERGOGLIO:
Este hombre que protesta con
ustedes se llama Astiz.
Es amigo personal del
Almirante Massera. Le dicen
el Angel de la Muerte. Por
eso vine hasta acá. Para
prevenirte. Es un informante.

ESTHER:
Do you know him? What are you
doing?
Why don’t you speak out!?

ESTHER:
Lo conoces? Y que estás
haciendo acá?
Porque’ no salís a hablar!?

BERGOGLIO:
If I spoke out I would not be
able to help you.

BERGOGLIO:
Si dijera algo, ya no podria
ayudarte.

BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
I took her books away for
safekeeping. Marx, Gramsci,
Guevara...
Esther’s Daugther is arrested inside a bus and dragged to a
paramilitar car.
PICK UP ON a young woman, weeks later, walking into the flat.
It’s Esther’s daughter. She is pregnant
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
She looked at me like a stranger...
with fear... That was the last time
I ever saw her. She warned me and I
didn’t listen. Had I listened I
would not have made the mistakes I
made.
CUT TO:
INT. SEMINARY LIBRARY (1976) - DAY
Helped by discontented seminarians, an orderly is taking
books from the shelves and putting them into a trolley. And
by a fuming Father JALICS (who we saw greet him when he
joined the order)
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
I saw my role as to protect the
Jesuit order and its priests. As
you mentioned, I purged the library
of Marxist texts.

81

INT. BASILICA (1976) - DAY
During a MASS, BERGOGLIO is placing COMMUNION WAFERS on the
tongues of the congregation who file forward and open their
mouths...

BERGOGLIO:
The body of Christ...The body
of Christ...

BERGOGLIO:
El cuerpo de Cristo... El
cuerpo de Cristo.

But then a POOR WOMAN has her MOUTH CLOSED.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
I stuck to the rules.
POOR WOMAN:
Remarried.

MUJER HUMILDE:
Me volví a casar, padre.

BERGOGLIO nods, understandingly, and instead of offering her
a WAFER, makes the SIGN OF THE CROSS instead, thereby
“blessing” her. He then moves on to the next person and
resumes setting wafers on tongues....
CUT TO:
EXT. RIVADAVIA - CAR WORKSHOP (1976) - DAY
Yorio and Jalics are overseeing a car repair workshop run by
young people - it’s a slum project (we’ll see more of later).
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
I closed down our projects in the
slums.
INT. RIVADAVIA - CAR WORKSHOP (1976) - DAY
Some teenage boys are working under the bonnet of a truck in
a roughly constructed workshop - the walls are made of old
billboards. An older man (LUIS) is showing them what to do.
Bergoglio arrives. Fr. Jalics sees him and comes to greet him
warmly.
JALICS:
Jorge, Father Jorge. My dear
son.

JALICS:
Jorge, padre Jorge... Mi hijo
querido.

He embraces Bergoglio and introduces him to Luis.

82

JALICS: (CONT'D)
This is Fr. Jorge. I used to
teach him and now he is the
head of all Jesuits in
Argentina. Oh. And Uruguay.

JALICS: (CONT’D)
Te presento al Padre Jorge.
Yo fui su maestro y ahora él
es el superior de todos los
Jesuitas de Argentina...
ah... y de Uruguay!

Warm greetings.
JALICS: (CONT'D)
The young men are learning
skills here. (WRY) They’re
also learning about injustice
- the injustice of their own
lives.

JALICS: (CONT’D)
Los muchachos están
aprendiendo algunas
habilidades ...
(irónico)
También están aprendiendo
sobre las injusticias --empezando por la injusticia
de sus propias vidas.

BERGOGLIO:
I need you to close Rivadavia
down.

BERGOGLIO
Necesito que cierren
Rivadavia.

What?!

JALICS:

¿Qué decís?

JALICS:

PICK UP ON Bergoglio and Jalics have now been joined by two
other priests - YORIO and DOURRON.
YORIO:
We’ve built this mission from
nothing. These are our
people.

YORIO:
No construimos esta misión
para nada... Esta es nuestra
gente.

BERGOGLIO:
Since Massera took over, I
have not lost one Jesuit
because...

BERGOGLIO:
Desde que Massera llegó al
poder, no perdí ni un jesuita
porque---

JALICS:
Because you don’t speak out
against the regime. Because
you’ve made us irrelevant.

JALICS:
--- porque no hablás en
contra del régimen. Porque
nos hiciste pasar por
irrelevantes.

BERGOGLIO:
No. I don’t speak out. I
shelter people in the Maximo.
Smuggle people over the
border.

BERGOGLIO:
No... No hablo en contra...
Sin embargo le di refugio a
muchos en el Máximo... Y
ayudé a otros a cruzar la
frontera...

83

YORIO:
That’s not the point. Saving
a few here a few there. We
need to save the country.

YORIO
Ese no es el punto. Salvás a
unos pocos por acá y a otros
pocos por allá... Nosotros
necesitamos salvar el país.

BERGOGLIO:
They’re watching you. They
don’t like what they see. I
know this for a fact.

BERGOGLIO:
Los están vigilando. Y no les
gusta lo que están viendo. Lo
sé. Es un hecho.

How?
What?

YORIO:
BERGOGLIO:

YORIO:
How do you know that, Jorge?

¿Cómo?
¿Qué?

YORIO:
BERGOGLIO:

YORIO:
Cómo lo sabés, Jorge.

Bergoglio looks uncharacteristically shifty.

BERGOGLIO:
My role is to protect the
order.

BERGOGLIO:
Mi función es proteger a la
Compañía.

YORIO:
That’s our calling now? To
protect ourselves?

YORIO:
¿Ese es nuestro llamado
ahora? ¿Protegernos a
nosotros mismos?

JALICS:
I TAUGHT you in the seminary.
How do we get to know Christ?
By following his footsteps.
Where do they lead? Here.

JALICS:
Yo te lo enseñé en el
seminario. ¿Cómo llegamos a
conocer a Cristo? Siguiendo
sus pasos. ¿Y dónde nos
llevan esos pasos? Acá.

BERGOGLIO:
Or to the firing squad.

BERGOGLIO:
O al pelotón de fusilamiento.

YORIO:
And if so, so be it.

YORIO:
Si eso es lo que tiene que
ser, que sea.

84

BERGOGLIO:
I am your provincial, and I’m
begging you - come back to
the Maximo.

BERGOGLIO
Yo soy su superior. Y les
estoy rogando que vuelvan al
Máximo.

YORIO:
And if we don’t?.

YORIO:
¿Y si no obedecemos?

BERGOGLIO:
You’re Jesuits. You made a
vow, break that vow and you
are no longer Jesuits.

BERGOGLIO:
Ustedes son jesuitas.
Hicieron un voto, rompan ese
voto, y dejarán de ser
jesuitas.

DOURRON:
If we aren’t recognised by
the Order, we are no longer
protected. You could be
signing our death warrant.

DOURRON:
Si no somos reconocidos por
la Compañía, ya no estamos
protegidos... Podés estar
firmando nuestra sentencia de
muerte.

BERGOGLIO:
(imploring)
So keep to your vows. Come
back with me to the Maximo.

BERGOGLIO:
(implorando)
Entonces mantengan sus votos.
Vuelvan al Máximo.

Jalics looks at the others before speaking.
JALICS:
We refuse to cease our
activities here. You carry
on taking tea with killers.

JALICS:
Nos oponemos a terminar con
nuestras actividades acá.
Podés seguir tomando té con
los asesinos.

BERGOGLIO:
I will talk to anyone who can
help me save lives. And you
will shut down, under
obedience, your project in
Villa 11.14, Rivadavia.
That’s an order.

BERGOGLIO:
Yo voy a hablar con quien sea
que me pueda ayudar a salvar
vidas. Y ustedes, bajo
mandato de obediencia, van a
terminar con su proyecto en
la Villa 11.14, Rivadavia. Es
una orden.

YORIO and JALICS say nothing, but rather turn and walk out.
BERGOGLIO is furious. He kicks something.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
They disobeyed my orders...
questioned my authority...
CUT TO:

85

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio and Ratzinger are seated together under the
balcony..
RATZINGER:
You made a difficult, perhaps an
imperfect choice.
BERGOGLIO:
What is an order if it’s not its
priests and its people. I missed
it. I was supposed to protect them.
I failed.
CUT TO:
EXT. BUENOS AIRES EZEIZA (1976) - DAY
Father DOURRON is pedalling along a narrow street on his
bicycle when he sees military vehicles approach the Mission.
He looks behind him - some troops are walking into place at
the other end of the street.
He hides behind a fence.
CUT TO:
EXT. RIVADAVIA (1976) - DAY
Soldiers pile out of trucks and run to the Mission.
PICK UP ON Jalics, who is trying to get to the Mission. He
almost runs into a group of soldiers who level their weapons
at him. He goes down on his knees with his hands in the air.
At the same time the paramilitary take Yorio from the Mission
to the second truck.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
It is not easy to entrust oneself
to God’s mercy. I know, he has a
very special capacity for
forgetting our mistakes. God
forgets, but I don’t.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY
Bergoglio looks up from the memory into the face of
Ratzinger.
86

BERGOGLIO:
Fathers Jorio and Yalics - my old
teachers - were taken away and
tortured for months. Their hands
were broken.
He looks up at the images of blood and martyrdom that run
through the frescoes.
BERGOGLIO:
I went back to Massera. I took my
tea. I implored for their freedom.
But it wasn’t enough.
INT. ADMIRAL MASSERA’S OFFICE - DAY
BERGOGLIO enters the Marine headquarters determined to talk
to Massera. After a long wait he’s taken to Massera’s room.
The door opens, Massera is watching a Tennis Match, Villas
and Borg. He is a big fan.
BERGOGLIO:
You have two of my priests.
Fathers Jalics and Yorio.
You’re detaining them...

BERGOGLIO:
Usted tiene a dos de mis
sacerdotes. Padres Jalics y
Yorio. Usted los tiene
detenidos.

ADMIRAL MASSERA
I will of course make
enquiries, Father.

ALMIRANTE MASSERA
Por supuesto haré la
investigación pertinente,
padre.

BERGOGLIO:
They are not involved in any
activities.

BERGOGLIO:
Ellos no están involucrados
en ninguna actividad.

ADMIRAL MASSERA
Then why did you kick them
out?

ALMIRANTE MASSERA:
¿Entonces porqué los expulsó
(de la Compañía)?

BERGOGLIO:
I did not kick them out. They
were temporarily out of
communion. A technical issue
only. Who told you this?

BERGOGLIO:
No los expulsé. Sólo les
negué la comunión
temporalmente. Una cuestión
técnica, nada más. ¿Quién le
dijo eso?

87

ADMIRAL MASSERA:
We see and hear everything.

ALMIRANTE MASSERA:
Nosotros vemos y oimos todo.

BERGOGLIO:
It’s been four months. What
are you doing with them?

BERGOGLIO:
Ya pasaron cuatro meses. ¿Qué
está haciendo con ellos?

ADMIRAL MASSERA:
I am sure they are being well
taken care of. I’ve told all
this to Tortolo

ALMIRANTE MASSERA:
Estoy seguro de que los están
cuidando muy bien. Ya he
hablado de todo esto con el
arzobispo Tortolo.

BERGOGLIO:
Monsignor Tortolo

BERGOGLIO:
Monsignor Tortolo

ADMIRAL MASSERA:
(losing temper)
Now look here Bergoglio!

ALMIRANTE MASSERA:
(perdiendo la paciencia)
Ya basta, Bergoglio!

BERGOGLIO:
Admiral! I know full well
where my priests are, and I
need them freed!

BERGOGLIO:
Almirante! Yo sé
perfectamente dónde están mis
sacerdotes, y exijo que los
liberen!

ADMIRAL MASSERA:
But they’re not your priests,
are they? As you said - a
“technical issue”. You should
think of the implications
before you act.

ADMIRAL MASSERA:
Pero no son sus sacerdotes,
no es así? Como usted bien
dijo, “una cuestión técnica”.
Debería pensar en las
implicancias de sus actos
antes de actuar.

INT. ESMA - DAY
JALICS and YORIO sit semi naked in their cells, with sacks
over their heads...
BERGOGLIO (V.O.)
My words had no impact. Empty.
RATZINGER : (V.O.)
Well you did all you could.
BERGOGLIO : (V.O.)
It wasn’t enough. I did what was
safe... and justified it as trying
to protect my Order.
RATZINGER : (V.O.)
Dictatorships take away our freedom
to choose... we both know that.
88

BERGOGLIO : (V.O.)
Yes, or perhaps they reveal our own
weaknesses. They test who we are.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
The two men are still sitting under the balcony.
BERGOGLIO
December 18th, 1977.
RATZINGER:
What is that?
Bergoglio looks haunted.
CUT TO:

INT. HERCULES MILITARY PLANE (1977) - DAY
The scream of aero-engines. Esther’s hand is grabbed by a
naval officer and stretched out to its length. Another
officer injects her with something. She is struggling but the
injection makes her stop.
WIDE: TWO OTHER WOMEN are being unshackled. They have all
been drugged.
The DOORS on the AIRCRAFT are then SLID OPEN, and we see that
the PLANE is flying over Ocean.
One by one the WOMEN are flung to their deaths. They do not
resist. Cannot resist. Finally it’s Esther’s turn. She is
pulled to the edge. And then thrown out into the sea.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
And then they took Esther, my dear
friend.
BACK TO:
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio and Ratzinger still talking together next to
Michelangelo’s Last Judgement with its images of smashed and
tortured bodies.

89

BERGOGLIO:
There were so many bodies washed up
on the shores that the coast guard
complained they could no longer
cope.
BERGOGLIO’s expression is one of great guilt. The Pope’s
face is bent in prayer. He finally opens his eyes and looks
at BERGOGLIO...
BERGOGLIO:
Where was Christ in the days of the
dictatorship - was he having
meetings in the presidential
palace, or was he being tortured in
the prisons. And where was I?
RATZINGER:
Dictatorships take away the freedom
to choose. We both know that.
BERGOGLIO:
I could have spoken out in public.
RATZINGER:
And if no one had listened. What
then?
BERGOGLIO:
Every choice that Fathers Yorio and
Jalics made, I made the opposite. A
leader belongs with his people, not
hidden away in a palace.
CUT AWAY TO:
EXT. CORDOBA (MID 1980’S) - DAY
The figure of Bergoglio walking through the desolate, dusty
condor-haunted hills. The image may seem like a metaphor at
this point but we’ll discover that it’s a memory...
RATZINGER: (V.O.)
Perhaps the path appears straight
when we look back at it. On the way
we often feel lost...
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
Ratzinger places his hand on Bergoglio’s.

90

RATZINGER:
You cannot teach mercy without
having experienced mercy. Let me
show you another Bergoglio, the one
you are blind to. Let me reveal you
to yourself Bergoglio looks up. What’s going on? Is Ratzinger defending
him?
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
You talk about your authority. What
did you do with that authority? You
used it to save dozens of lives.
Bergoglio is surprised that Ratzinger knows this.
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
It’s in the file. You hid families
of trade unionists in the seminary.
You even drove some of them up to
the border yourself.
BERGOGLIO
It wasn’t enough.
INSERT: Bergoglio hides activists at Colegio Maximo.
RATZINGER:
Not for your brother Jesuits, no.
BERGOGLIO:
Pride obscured my judgement. The
right to say Mass was removed and
with it, the protection of the
Church. I was supposed to protect
them...I failed.
INT. COLEGIO MAXIMO OFFICE (MID 1980’S) - DAY
BERGOGLIO surrenders his many keys to the RECTOR...who
solemnly watches this stripping away of BERGOGLIO’s power...
RATZINGER (V.O.)
They accused you of hard line
views, of being right-wing, of
having sinned by doing too little,
of being egotistical. These are the
things that were said about you in
the dossier, during the conclave.
CUT TO:

91

MONTAGE:
A) Majestic wide-shots of - mountains, dry hills, peasant
farmers working their dry land...

not to contact you. Finally, in
shame ..

C) MIDDAY. CORDOBA. BERGOGLIO stands, looking at the Jesuit
Residencia Mayor in Cordoba, Argentina.
D) ROOM No. 5 of the simple adobe sleeping cells. The room
is small and red. Heavy red curtains, red-tiled floor, red
coverlet on the bed. A painting of the Crucifixion is the
only adornment. It looks like the cell of a monk or a
prisoner. BERGOGLIO enters E) Canteen.

Many other books are around.
I) BERGOGLIO sleeps on a simple small bed.
BERGOGLIO(V.O.)
I heard a lot of confessions ...I
learned to listen and saw people
that I didn’t see before.
BERGOGLIO in Room No. 5, sitting on his bed, under the
shuttered window, hears Confession through the shutters.
Outside the open shutters, a PEASANT admits his sins -

92

PEASANT 1
Bless me father for I have
sinned.

CAMPESINO 1
Bendígame, padre, porque he
pecado.

PEASANT 2
Bless me father for I have
sinned.

CAMPESINO 3
Bendígame padre---

BERGOGLIO, on his bed, his back to the wall under the
shuttered window, weeps.
INT. SMALL CHAPEL/ CORDOBA (MID 1980’S) - DAY
BERGOGLIO is saying MASS to a small collection of country
folk in a simple country CHAPEL.
He moves to the LECTERN to deliver his sermon and looks at
the simple COUNTRY FOLK.
The COUNTRY FOLK look back at him.
He goes to speak but his LIPS DO NOT MOVE - at first. But
then he knows what he wants to say...

93

BERGOGLIO:
I used to have a TV. I like
to
watch football.
(beat)
My team is--well--I can tell
anyone who is interested
later.
(beat)
A TV needs--an aerial. And a
signal. Some days the signal
is
bad--who knows why. Like
prayer. Some days the signal
from God is strong, it goes
very well, you feel that
connection, really plugged
in, in direct communication,
but other days--it’s all you
can do to feel “well, I tried-at least today I tried.” You
feel you got nothing back.
People expect it to be
different for a priest, as if
God
and I have a hot-line,
installed by Michelangelo
working from a diagram by Da
Vinci.

BERGOGLIO:
Yo solía tener televisión. Me
gustaba mirar fútbol.
(se detiene un instante)
Yo soy hincha de--- bueno,
eso se lo puedo decir más
tarde al que esté
interesado... Una televisión
necesita una antena. Y una
señal. A veces la señal es
mala, quien sabe porqué...
Como cuando rezamos. A veces
la señal que nos envía Dios
es fuerte y clara, funciona
bien, uno puede sentir la
conexión, estamos realmente
enchufados, en comunicación
directa... Pero hay otros
días donde uno solo puede
decir: “bueno... por lo menos
lo intenté”... Porque uno
siente que no recibe nada...
que no tiene respuesta. La
gente piensa que para
nosotros, los sacerdotes,
funciona distinto, como si
Dios tuviera línea directa
con nosotros, una línea
construida por Miguel Angel
gracias a un diagrama de Da
Vinci.

INSERT:
Images of Bergoglio, alone, walking on the beautiful and dry
landscape of Cordoba.
BERGOGLIO:
(smiles)
What I’m saying is...I am not
worthy to deliver a sermon
today. The words would be
just my words would only be
mine...and so most likely
wrong or misleading. It would
be better that you teach me.
I am sorry.

BERGOGLIO:
(sonríe)
Lo que quiero decir es... que
hoy no merezco darles un
sermón... Mis palabras serían
solo mis palabras... y
probablemente serían
equivocadas o confusas... Son
ustedes los que me tienen que
enseñar a mi. Eso sería lo
mejor. Disculpen.

He moves back to the altar and continues the MASS - the
congregation are stunned!

94

INT. SMALL CHAPEL CORDOBA (MID 1980’S) - DAY
In a SLUM CHURCH, during a small MASS for the SLUM DWELLERS,
he offers the WAFER (during “COMMUNION”) then puts it into
the open ouths of the congregation who file forward...
BERGOGLIO
The body of Christ...
The body of Christ...
The body of Christ...

BERGOGLIO
El cuerpo de Cristo...
El cuerpo de Cristo...
El cuerpo de Cristo...

But then one WOMAN has her MOUTH CLOSED. She whispers -

SLUM WOMAN 1
Father, I am divorced.

MUJER HUMILDE 1
(por lo bajo)
Padre, soy divorciada.

BERGOGLIO nods, then doesn’t hesitate, he places a WAFER into
the woman’s mouth.
Me too.

SLUM WOMAN 2

MUJER HUMILDE 2
Yo también soy divorciada.

He serves her. Then moves to the next man, who also has his
mouth closed.
SLUM MAN 1
Remarried.

HOMBRE HUMILDE
Me volví a casar, padre.

BERGOGLIO serves him too, then notices that the next man also
has his MOUTH CLOSED.
BERGOGLIO looks at the entire congregation. He shouldn’t
really be giving communion to any of these people - but does
so.
EXT. SMALL CHAPEL/ CORDOBA (MID 1980’S) - DAY
Bergoglio is outside of the chapel sharing mate with the
people that has just left. He’s light and happy.
MONTAGE CORDOBA LANDSCAPE CONTINUES:
A) Bergoglio is walking with some priests.
B) Bergoglio is sitting on a rock.
C) Bergoglio is camping by a lake.
D) Bergoglio is playing football with local teenagers.

95

EXT. CORDOBA (MID 1980’S) - DAY
Bergoglio walks alone along a dirty road. Huge mountains
behind. He’s insignificant compared to that landscape.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
Ratzinger and Bergoglio are still sitting together.
RATZINGER:
It took years. Until you were
noticed. Cardinal Quarracino
noticed you at an international
conference. You gave a famous
speech. I have it here ...
He starts to read it...
INT. MODERN BUILDING - BUENOS AIRES - 2000 - DAY
A packed INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE of PRIESTS and LAY-PEOPLE
await the SPEAKER...
BERGOGLIO (our older Bergoglio) is at the lectern, speaking
in English.
RATZINGER (V.O.)
We have known tyranny in this
country, but--a new tyranny rises
up...
BERGOGLIO walks up to the lectern.
Ratzinger’s VO fades and Bergoglio’s voice comes to the fore.
BERGOGLIO:
A new tyranny rises up. Not just
here, but across the world.
He stands there and surveys the large packed congregation,
pausing before speaking. A protestor shouts...
PROTESTOR
Who are you to talk about tyranny!
You were friends with the tyrant!
People join in, booing Bergoglio.
Bergoglio bows his head, taking it, almost expecting it.
96

BERGOGLIO
A tyranny not just of oppression or
repression or terror. A tyranny of
unfair economic structures that
create huge inequalities.
BERGOGLIO
Twenty percent of
the world’s population consumes
resources at a rate that robs the
poor nations and future
generations of what they need to
survive. Just as the commandment
“Thou shalt not kill” sets a clear
limit in order to safeguard the
value of human life, today we also
have to say “thou shalt not” to an
economy of exclusion and
inequality which idolises money.
Such an economy also kills.
ANGLE ON: CARDINAL ANTONIO QUARRACINO, who realises he is
hearing something new here, and so takes out a DICTAPHONE to
record this. He starts TAPING the ADDRESS...
Here, BERGOGLIO falls silent - and we prelap the POPE’s words
into the next scene BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
There is a phrase now “trickle down
economics”. Let me tell you,
nothing trickles down to the poor
but poverty and injustice.
CARDINAL QUARRACINO looks around him to see how BERGOGLIO’s
message is being received. His POV of: transfixed people,
riveted. He turns back to BERGOGLIO, who resumes BERGOGLIO (CONT'D)
Every community is called to be an
instrument for the liberation,
the liberation and the promotion
of the poor!
He steps down. The CONGREGATION are not quite sure what they
have heard.
Cardinal Quarracino sees Bergoglio surrounded by journalists.
Quarrantino approaches to congratulate and talk to Bergoglio
but we don’t hear what they’re saying.
RATZINGER: (V.O.)
You were made bishop. But you did
not live like one.
(MORE)
97

RATZINGER: (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You renounced luxury. You became
the “Bishop Of The Slums. You did
the work you once denied Fathers
Yorio and Jalics!
EXT. BUENOS AIRES (2012) - DAY
A Drone Shot shows two faces of the vast city; firstly
showing the affluent skyline of office blocks then we’re in
the middle of Villa 21. Bergoglio is being driven on a trike
through the Villa. The drone follows him from behind. Some
people greet him as he walks.
EXT. VILLA 21 (2002), FOOD KITCHEN AND CLOTHES DISTRIBUTION
CENTRE - DAY
Bergoglio helping out in a food kitchen and distributing
clothes.
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
I tried to walk the road from which
I banished them. Every vegetable I
chopped... Every eviction we
prevented. Every case we pleaded,
was some kind of penance.
Yes.

RATZINGER: (V.O.)

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
He is still sitting close to Ratzinger. He looks him in the
eye.
RATZINGER:
My dear son, you have confessed to
me. Allow me to absolve you.
Bergoglio hesitates. Has he been out-manoeuvred?
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Believe in the mercy that you
preach.
Bergoglio bows his head.
RATZINGER:
I absolve you in the name of the
father and of the son and of the
Holy Spirit.

98

Bergoglio looks up. He looks less haunted, more ready.
BERGOGLIO:
Thank you, Father.
The tourists door opens. Roberto comes in. Two security
guards stay close to the door. We’re aware of noise outside.
ROBERTO:
Holy Father, it’s nine o’clock,
they are opening the doors to the
public.
The doors at the far end of the chapel open. A couple of
Swiss Guards come in and take up positions.
RATZINGER:
Oh, Heaven. The museums...the
tourists...
ROBERTO:
Should I delay the opening, Holy
Father?
RATZINGER:
No, no. Of course not. Some of
those people have waited all their
lives to see this. (TO BERGOGLIO)
Come ...
The guards hold the entrance door till the Pope has gone. The
sound of tourists can be heard outside.
Ratzinger opens a little door and they slip into...
INT. VATICAN - CHAMBER OF TEARS (2012) - DAY
As they settle down...
BERGOGLIO:
Holy Father, are you hungry?
Ratzinger looks startled. No one ever asks him that.
RATZINGER:
Do you know, I think perhaps I am.
He glances at Roberto, who is taken aback.
ROBERTO:
I could ask the kitchens to ...

99

BERGOGLIO:
No need. There’s a place just in
front of Via de Porta Angelica.
Excellent coffee and pizzas.
Roberto looks utterly nonplussed. But the Pope nods at him.
INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
The door is opened, as the tourists enter Roberto crosses the
way in the opposite direction.
GUARDS
No photos, please... Nessuna
foto, per favore...

GUARDIE
Niente foto, per favore...
Nessuna foto, per piacere.

EXT. ROME - VIA DE PORTA ANGELICA (2012) - DAY
Roberto - looking painfully uncomfortable - has just ordered
at the bar.
BAR:
To take away?

BAR OWNER:
Da portare via?

ROBERTO:
(NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE IN
HIS LIFE) Yes. To take away.

ROBERTO:
(IN TUTTA LA SUA VITA NON
L’HA MAI DETTO QUESTO) Si. Da
portare via.

INT. VATICAN - CHAMBER OF TEARS (2012) - DAY
RATZINGER:
They call it the Chamber of Tears.
I came in here Josef Ratzinger, I
left as Benedict XVI. No one tells
you if they are tears of joy or
tears of sorrow.
BERGOGLIO:
I suppose that’s up to you.
RATZINGER:
Yes. I suppose it is.
Roberto comes in with coffee, fanta and a pizza.
Fathers.

ROBERTO:

RATZINGER:
Thank you, Roberto.
100

He goes. Only when he’s gone does Ratzinger allow himself to
giggle.
RATZINGER
You know, whenever a Pope eats,
there used to be three Jesuits
present to act as “food
tasters.” Lack of Jesuits has
poisoned more than one Pope.
BERGOGLIO:
I can take a bite of your slice if
you like. Just to be on the safe
side. Would you say grace, Father?
RATZINGER:
Thank you Lord, for this food-that we enjoy here--in this
place--outside of time and the-the relentless concerns of the
outside world...
BERGOGLIO begins the Sign Of The Cross, thinking Grace
completed...but...
RATZINGER:
...where--if but for a moment-we may find serenity--peace-tranquility...
(silence, then - )
Lord, your church, your flock is in
crisis. Grant us the wisdom--and
the strength...
BERGOGLIO thinks again the grace is over, until RATZINGER
...to oppose the hypocrisy that
disfigures her.
Is it over? Surely it is! Until - the POPE resumes, even more
fervently...the knuckles of his folded hands white with
strain...something BERGOGLIO notices with concern RATZINGER:
St. Francis intercede for us as we
seek to repair the church...
The POPE then opens his eyes - and looks DIRECTLY at
BERGOGLIO...
RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Would you like to add anything?

101

Amen?
Amen.

BERGOGLIO:
RATZINGER:

They pick up the pizza.
RATZINGER:
I was thinking of your teachers Yorio and Jalics - did you ever
reconcile with them?
BERGOGLIO:
With Jalics. We said a Mass
together...
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. SACRISTY - CHURCH, ARGENTINA (1980’S) - DAY
In the vestry, BERGOGLIO dresses. His back is to the door,
when it opens and in walks - Fr. Jalics!
BERGOGLIO
Can you make sure the candles
are lit?

BERGOGLIO
¿Controlás que las velas
estén encendidas, por favor?

BERGOGLIO turns - and sees Jalics. Tension between them.

JALICS:
Arch-Bishop.
Jalics.

BERGOGLIO

JALICS
Arzobispo...
Jalics.

BERGOGLIO

Silence, then JALICS:
I must get ready.

JALICS:
Tengo que prepararme.
CUT TO:

INT. MASS (1980’S) - DAY
Bergoglio and Jalics are con-celebrating the mass together.
Jalics pour water on Bergoglio’s hand. Bergoglio washes it.
As he gets the towel to dry, they look at each other.
Bergoglio is uncomfortable.
102

PICK UP:
BERGOGLIO: (CONT’D)
The peace of the Lord be with
you. We can give each other a
fraternal hug to go in peace.

BERGOGLIO:
Que la paz del Señor esté con
ustedes.
Podemos darnos,
fraternalmente entre todos,
un abrazo de Paz.

They both turn to each other. Eyes meet eyes - both have
compassion for the other.
BERGOGLIO (V.O.)
We cried. In each other’s arms. He
forgave me.
With his eyes, Jalics forgives, smiling through his tears.
INT. VATICAN THE CHAMBER OF TEARS (2012) - DAY
BERGOGLIO has begun to cry, at the memory.
And Yorio?

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
To the end he thought me a traitor.
And now he is dead. I am still
divisive in Argentina.
RATZINGER:
Yesterday you told me that Life is
never static?
(slight pause)
You lead, not by power, not by
intellect, but by how you live or
the way you HAVE lived.
(slight pause)
You have changed.
BERGOGLIO:
But, Father, that man, that doubt
is still inside me.
Ratzinger looks around - almost as if looking for a clock something distracting - something to deflect the
conversation.
RATZINGER:
What is the time I wonder?
Ratzinger gets up and goes to check that they are alone,
looks at BERGOGLIO - then makes a decision.
103

RATZINGER:
I am going to introduce you to a
man who has not changed and refuses
to change, and you are going to
hear for yourself the price he has
paid. I have to request that YOU
hear his confession.
RATZINGER:
My old friend Father Carmine
usually hears it but this time I
would prefer you.
I mean, you wouldn’t deny me a
confession, would you Cardinal?
(pause)
Don’t be afraid.
BERGOGLIO:
How should I start?
RATZINGER:
I don’t know... What do you usually
say?
BERGOGLIO: (FEELS WRONG)
How long since your last
confession?
RATZINGER:
Eight days. Perhaps.
Bergoglio asks the formula questions and immediately gets
nervous - they’re not very Pope-appropriate.
BERGOGLIO
And have you sinned greatly in that
time? I don’t mean to imply that
you ...
RATZINGER:
Of course I’ve sinned - numerous
sins - venal sins.
(he begins)
To God - I wish to repent for the
sins of my life. In choosing to do
wrong and failing to do good, I
have sinned against You, Lord, whom
I should love above all things.
(pause)
As a child I failed you first--by
not having the bravery to taste
life. I hid away in
books.
(pause)
(MORE)
104

RATZINGER: (CONT'D)
Then in war I joined the Hitler
Youth. Every fourteen year old was
ordered to. I deserted. But within
the church, I took part in the
enforcement - enforcement of the
truth.
Oh?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
Yes. Rules, you see, defined my
life. Obedience under the law.I
know now that this has left me
empty of the world our Church is
meant to help. Is this why, as
Archbishop--of Munich I failed you
again?
Go on...

BERGOGLIO:

And here, POPE BENEDICT leans in closely to BERGOGLIO’s ear.
ECU on: his LIPS, as they begin to move.
WIDE: We do not hear the POPE’s CONFESSION. But see it at a
distance - hearing nothing, until BERGOGLIO moves back from him..
RATZINGER:
Forgive me.
Still BERGOGLIO withholds forgiveness
BERGOGLIO:
He was transferred--from parish
to parish?
RATZINGER:
I did not give sufficient
attention to the duties assigned
to this one priest.
BERGOGLIO:
“Sufficient attention”?! (silence)
On and on? Village after village?
Forgive me

RATZINGER:

BERGOGLIO:
BUT YOU KNEW?
105

RATZINGER:
(Avoiding this) I should have
known. The facts were sent to me.
Evidence was placed on my desk
BERGOGLIO:
So while you were enforcing the
truth, the rule, you forgot to love
the people you were meant to
protect. (beat). You confessed, you
said there was more.
RATZINGER
I ask for forgiveness.
Bergoglio touches his shoulder.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT’D)
It’s here, in confession, where we
are forced to look at the vastness
of our failures, that we finally
see the vastness of His mercy.
BERGOGLIO sees the Pope’s pain - and moves back to him.
BERGOGLIO
If this confession is the sole
reason you wish to resign, then
it’s even more important you stay
now and heal this wound Stay here.
Complete the work you have begun.
RATZINGER:
Every reason I give you is never
enough. Then listen again...!
(powerfully)
SILENCE!
(beat)
I can no longer hear God’s voice.
BERGOGLIO:
We all have that experience RATZINGER:
(powerfully)
I can no longer hear God! I believe
in God! I pray...but only silence.
How can I reveal his Word to our
millions of pilgrims if I do not
hear his presence?

106

BERGOGLIO:
I too ... Mother Theresa ... the
Lord Himself cried out why have you
abandoned me.
RATZINGER:
No. I have been alone my whole
life, but I have never been lonely,
until now. You wished for an
“extraordinary reason” for my
resignation - do you have one now?
BERGOGLIO:
And you have told this to - ?
RATZINGER:
No-one. You. Just you. But these
last two days, I have heard him
again.
You see?

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
Speaking to me in the last voice I
expected him to use - yours. Yours
Cardinal.
No.

BERGOGLIO:

RATZINGER:
I have heard him in you. Perhaps I
could no longer hear Him, NOT
because He is withdrawing from me,
but because He is saying, “go my
faithful servant.”
Bergoglio helps him out of his chair and faces him, then
closes his eyes and folds his fingers...
BERGOGLIO
God, the father of mercies, has
sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;
May God grant you His pardon and
peace and I absolve you of your
sins ...
In a more personal tone Bergoglio quotes Ratzinger to
himself. There’s a tender irony.

107

BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
But remember... truth may be vital
but without love it is also
unbearable - Caritas in Veritate.
BERGOGLIO walks away, his back turned on The Pope, to say BERGOGLIO
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit. Amen.
The POPE and the CARDINAL, at a distance, bless themselves...
BERGOGLIO now looks very burdened by the truth as the POPE
rises to his feet RATZINGER:
You have lifted a great burden from
my shoulders.
BERGOGLIO:
You have placed a heavy one on
mine.
Bergoglio opens the door to leave but the Sistine Chapel is
packed with tourists. He quickly closes the door again.
BERGOGLIO
Is there another route? Shall I
call security?
RATZINGER:
I’ve been hiding behind security
for too long. They’re my people.
I’m their Pope. For now. Let’s go.
Bergoglio grins. Opens the door.

They go out into the fray.

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL (2012) - DAY
Ratzinger and Bergoglio cross the crowded Sistine Chapel.
They try not to draw too much attention to themselves but it
soon becomes clear that the Pope is in the place.
People crowd around Ratzinger, asking for his blessing and
for selfies.
Roberto and the security are waiting rush to rescue the Pope
but Bergoglio waves them away.
BERGOGLIO
Look. He’s happy. Let him enjoy the
moment.
108

Bergoglio steps back, watching and smiling at the fuss and
the grace with which Ratzinger tries to deal with it.
A barrage of cellphones point at Ratzinger, most of them with
flashes on.
GUARDS
Nessuna foto, per favore...
When Ratzinger finally gets free he walks with Bergoglio.
EXT. VATICAN FORECOURT (2012) - DAY
Bergoglio is carrying his bags to a car, where sits the same
driver we saw earlier.
RATZINGER
(beat)
You will be pleased to go home I
expect?
BERGOGLIO
Speaking English is exhausting.
RATZINGER
(nods)
Terrible language--so many
exceptions to every rule.
Remember Cardinal (pointing to himself)
“silence incarnate”.
He looks up at the building.
RATZINGER:
You know the story of St. Francis?
How when he heard God asking him to
restore his church, he thought he
meant bricks and mortar? Remember
poor St. Francis. Remember even he
was wrong sometimes.
Bergoglio goes in for a hug. Once again it’s a bit awkward Ratzinger is not used to being hugged - but this time at
least they’re both going for the same thing. They end up in a
slightly odd embrace.
BERGOGLIO:
You know Francis loved to dance. He
would have learnt to tango.
RATZINGER:
Too late for me.
109

BERGOGLIO:
Easier than you think. Look.
RATZINGER
Nein, nein. No, no, no, no.
BERGOGLIO:
I will lead.
My right leg, your left.
BERGOGLIO then proceeds to do the first TANGO steps with the
Pope.
ANGLE ON: the SWISS GUARDS. Trying not to watch as - BERGOGLIO tries to lead the POPE in a dance... accompanying
the effort by quietly singing a tango ...
The Pope is a lousy dancer. They finally stop and laugh, as
the POPE waves to ROBERTO, who approaches with a farewell
GIFT...
BERGOGLIO goes to the waiting car. The same driver as last
time. He greets the driver warmly. The driver opens the front
door. Smiles. Bergoglio enters the car watching and admiring,
as the POPE goes back inside.
INT. APOSTOLIC PALACE (2013) - DAY
A routine canonization service. 60 Elderly bishops and
cardinals are half asleep while Ratzinger reads from a
prepared speech.
RATZINGER:
Dear Brothers,
I have convoked you to this
Consistory, not only for the
three canonizations, but also
to communicate to you a
decision of great importance
for the life of the Church.
After having repeatedly
examined my conscience before
God, I have come to the
certainty that my strengths,
due to an advanced age, are
no longer suited to an
adequate exercise of the
Petrine ministry.

RATZINGER:
Fratres carissimi,
Non solum propter tres
canonizationes ad hoc
Consistorium vos convocavi,
sed etiam ut vobis decisionem
magni momenti pro Ecclesiae
vita communicem. Conscientia
mea iterum atque iterum coram
Deo explorata ad cognitionem
certam perveni vires meas
ingravescente aetate non iam
aptas esse ad munus Petrinum
aeque administrandum.

PICK UP ON a cardinal muttering a translation to another
cardinal.

110

BISHOP:
Wait. This can’t be right.
Excuse me ...

BISHOP:
Aspetti. Mi devo essere
sbagliato. Mi scusi...

He looks at the next cardinal.
CARDINAL:
Excuse me did I hear
correctly? Did I translate
this right?

CARDINALE:
Mi scusi ma ho sentito bene?
Ho tradotto bene?

The Pope keeps talking.
RATZINGER:
For this reason, and well
aware of the seriousness of
this act, with full freedom I
declare that I renounce the
ministry of Bishop of Rome,
Successor of Saint Peter,
entrusted to me by the
Cardinals on 19 April 2005,
in such a way, that as from
28 February 2013, at 20:00
hours, the See of Rome, the
See of Saint Peter, will be
vacant and a Conclave to
elect the new Supreme Pontiff
will have to be convoked by
those whose competence it is.

RATZINGER:
Quapropter bene conscius
ponderis huius actus plena
libertate declaro me
ministerio Episcopi Romae,
Successoris Sancti Petri,
mihi per manus Cardinalium
die decima nona Aprilis anni
bis millesimi quinti
commissum renuntiare ita ut a
die vigesima octava februarii
anni bis millesimi decimi
tertii, hora vigesima, sedes
Romae, sedes Sancti Petri
vacet et Conclave ad
eligendum novum Summum
Pontificem ab his quibus
competit convocandum esse.

Like an autumn breeze blowing up dead leaves, the Pope’s
words disturb rank upon rank of elderly clerics one by one.
CUT TO:
INT. CATHEDRAL KITCHEN (2013) - DAY
Bergoglio is in the kitchen with Lisabetta watching EWTN or
similar while preparing a meal. He’s laughing. Lisabetta is
seated, being served. This is in Spanish but the TV is in
English.
LISABETTA:
You’re requested to give a
speech at ... what? What are
you laughing at.

LISABETTA:
Lo invitan a dar un discurso-- qué pasa? De qué se ríe?

111

BERGOGLIO:
He did it in Latin! He always
makes difficult announcements
in Latin so that only a few
of the cardinals will
understand ...

BERGOGLIO
¡Lo dijo en latín! Siempre
que tiene que decir algo
embromado lo dice en latín...
y así sólo lo entienden unos
pocos cardenales...

Lisabetta still doesn’t know what’s going on. On EWTN the
commentator has suddenly flipped into panic mode.
COMMENTATOR:
It seems that the Pope has
just made an extraordinary
announcement. We’re waiting
for a translation.

COMENTARISTA:
It seems that the Pope has
just made an extraordinary
announcement. We’re waiting
for a translation.

BERGOGLIO:
(TO LISABETTA) He just
resigned.

BERGOGLIO:
(a Lisabetta)
El Papa acaba de renunciar.

He what?

LISABETTA:

¿Qué?!!!

LISABETTA:

COMMENTATOR:
We apologise for the delay in the
translation. It’s because no one
has had to use this word in this
context for a thousand years. The
Pope has RENOUNCED the papacy.
We’re witnessing a papal
renunciation.
Off her astonishment we
CUT TO:
EXT. VATICAN - DAY
The College of Cardinals arriving for the Conclave, just as
at the beginning of the film.
Lots of journalists taking photographs. In the front of
shot, a bus pulls up and Bergoglio gets off and walks in
unnoticed by the press.
EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE - DAY
That tin pot chimney again - smokeless at the moment.

112

INT. SISTINE CHAPEL - DAY
The CARDINALS file up to the CHALICE to cast their vote.
ANGLE ON: a reluctant-looking BERGOGLIO, sitting there,
looking very weighed down, dazed, fearful of election.
Beside him sits the ARCHBISHOP HUMMES, an old friend, who
pats BERGOGLIO on the leg. BERGOGLIO would like to smile but
can’t.
The first two SCRUTINEERS read the ballots silently and mark
them on a TALLY...and then pass the ballot to - the THIRD
SCRUTINEER, who calls out the name.
THIRD SCRUTINEER
Bergoglio!
(next ballot)
Bergoglio!
(next ballot)
Bergoglio!
(and so on...)
Applause breaks out - spontaneous applause from the
Cardinals! - everyone has been keeping count. Everyone knows
he’s won.
THIRD SCRUTINEER
Bergoglio!
(next ballot)
Bergoglio!
(and so on...)
ANGLE ON: BERGOGLIO, as he opens his eyes. He looks at all
the happy faces looking at him, applauding. Some rise to
their feet. One or two CHEER. He stands up.
BERGOGLIO:
May God forgive you all for this.
Beside him, HUMMES is grinning, and applauding too. They hug.
HUMMES:
No se olvide de los pobres.
EXT. ST PETER’S SQUARE - NIGHT
Come in on the tin-pot chimney.
from it.

White smoke begins to spill

The square is filled with umbrellas, it’s a rainy night.
The crowd strains its eyes - raises binoculars - it’s white!
113

VATICAN WATCHER:
SMOKE! SMOKE! It’s white!
We hear the hubbub, outside, of the vast CROWD. Guarding the
doors to the balcony are TWO SWISS GUARDS.
THREE sets of PAPAL ROBES, of three different sizes, and FIVE
sets of RED SHOES, await the new Pope.
Enter, the PROTODEACON (Cardinal Jean Louis Tauran)...
...the GUARDS open the doors to the famous balcony, and
Tauran steps outside - to a huge roar (OFF) before the doors
are closed again. We thereafter hear his speech (OFFSTAGE)...
TAURAN:
Fratelli e sorelle carissimi
(the italians roar)
Queridísimos hermanos y hermanas.
(the hispanic contingent
roars)
Bien chers frères et sœurs.
(the French roar)
Liebe Brüeder und Schwestern
(a German roar)
Dear brothers and sisters
TAURAN : (CONT'D)
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
HABEMUS...PAPAM!
Enter BERGOGLIO, the new POPE FRANCIS (wearing the SCARLET
ROBES of a CARDINAL)....with a NUN and the CAMERLENGO.... He
removes his SCARLET robes, stripping down to a simple WHITE
CASSOCK with a SILK SASH. He looks at the THREE SETS of RED
VELVET ROBES, with ermine collars.
But instead of choosing, he turns to the nun.
BERGOGLIO
Do you have a phone?

BERGOGLIO
C’e’ un telefono?

She looks amazed.
BERGOGLIO (CONT’D)
I’d like to call the Pope.
Pope Benedict.

BERGOGLIO (CONT'D)
Vorrei chiamare il Papa. Papa
Benedetto.

She dials for him.

114

INT - MATER ECCLESIAE (2013)- NIGHT
Telephone rings in Mater Ecclesiae but nobody is around to
pick up.
Ratzinger is watching the announcement on TV.
His staff, two Nuns and a priest, are with him in the room.
None of them hears the phone. On the TV we see...
EXT - SAINT PETER’S SQUARE (2013) - NIGHT.
On the balcony ...
TAURAN:
The Lord Jorge Mario,
Cardinal Bergoglio, who has
taken the name Francis.

INT. VATICAN -

TAURAN:
Eminentissimum ac
reverendissimum dominum,
dominum Georgium Marium,
Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae
Cardinalem Bergoglio, qui
sibi nomen imposuit
Franciscum.

CHAMBER OF TEARS (2013) - NIGHT

A GREAT ROAR from the crowd as the Vatican Bells ring out...
BERGOGLIO (POPE FRANCIS) is still looking at the ROBES and
the RING.
NUN
Nobody answered, Holy Father.
CAMERLENGO
You must choose, Holy Father.
BERGOGLIO:
I will wear what I am wearing.
Thank you.
But -

CAMERLENGO

BERGOGLIO:
Please. Thank you.
CAMERLENGO
And the shoes? At least the red
shoes! They are part of a tradition
going back to ...
He will wear what he is wearing already...simple BLACK SHOES.
115

BERGOGLIO:
My own are fine. Thank you.
Then he is offered the scarlet stole.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
No. Thank you. The carnival is
over.
He looks around the Room of Tears.
He closes his eyes. For a second he sees, in his mind’s eye,
Ratzinger smiling at him saying the line about Francis being
always happy.
He opens his eyes and shakes these thoughts off.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT'D)
If there have to be tears, let’s
make them tears of joy.
He goes through to the balcony.
EXT. BALCONY / VATICAN (2013) - NIGHT
He waves to the crowds, to a huge cheer.
BERGOGLIO:
Buona Sera.
INT. ROOM NEXT TO BALCONY / VATICAN (2013) - NIGHT
The CAMERLENGO reacts with surprise at this break with
tradition...
CAMERLENGO
(whispered, to the NUN)
Buona Sera?
EXT. BALCONY / VATICAN (2013) - NIGHT
BERGOGLIO:
Good evening. You all know
that the duty of the Conclave
was to give a bishop to Rome.
It seems that my brother
Cardinals went almost to the
ends of the Earth to find one-but here we are.

BERGOGLIO:
Buonasera. Voi sapete che il
dovere del conclave era di
dare un vescovo a Roma.
Sembra che i miei fratelli
cardinali siano andati a
prenderlo quasi alla fine del
mondo -- ma, siamo qui...

116

REACTION CROWD, EMOTIONAL, AMUSED, in thrall (in stark
contrast to how they reacted to BENEDICT’s LATIN address.)
BERGOGLIO:
Above all, I’d like to make a
prayer now for our Bishop
Emeritus Benedict XVI. Let’s
pray together for him...Pater
nostro qui est en ciello..

BERGOGLIO:
Prima di tutto, vorrei fare
una preghiera per il nostro
Vescovo Emerito Benedetto
XVI. Preghiamo tutti insieme
per lui... Padre nostro che
sei nei cieli...

INT. TV ROOM/ MATER ECCLESIAE/ VATICAN (2013) - NIGHT
Benedict watches the ceremony in his room. It’s an emotional
moment for him. He knows this is also a personal message for
him.
EXT. VATICAN BALCONY (2013) - NIGHT
Bergoglio is addressing the crowds in Italian.
BERGOGLIO:
And now let us begin this
journey, this journey
together,
a journey of brotherhood in
love,
of mutual trust.
(pause)
Before the bishop blesses the
people, I ask that you would
pray to the Lord--to bless me
-

BERGOGLIO:
... E adesso incominciamo
questo cammino, questo
cammino insieme, un cammino
di fratellanza, d’amore, di
fiducia fra noi.
(pausa)
...Prima che il vescovo
benedica il popolo, Vi
chiedo, che voi, preghiate al
Signore affinche’ benedica
me...

In another break with tradition, he bends to touch his head
on the balcony. The great crowd falls completely silent!
INT. FLAT IN BUENOS AIRES (2013) - DAY
Lisabetta is watching these events on TV. She starts to cry.
Her husband comes in.
You OK?

HUSBAND:

LISABETTA:
Yes. Of course. I just feel
so bad for him. He’ll never
have his life back. He’ll
never come home again.

MARIDO:
¿Qué pasó? ¿Estás bien?
LISABETTA:
Si... si... Estoy bien...
sólo me siento triste por
él... Acaba de perder la vida
que tenía. Nunca más va a
volver a casa.

deeply.
BERGOGLIO:

It’s the custom to leave you alone,
Holiness.
BERGOGLIO:
I don’t want to be alone. I want
company. How am I getting home?
CAMERLENGO
You are home, Holy Father.
BERGOGLIO:
I would like to spend the night in
my old room. With my brother
Cardinals.
CAMERLENGO
I shall arrange the limousine.
BERGOGLIO:
No, no, no, no. I will go with the
other Cardinals.
CAMERLENGO
In--in the...?

VOICE:
Did you know that you can book any
flight on the Skytours website. Our
discount prices are internet
only...
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Oh good evening I...oh.
He’s mistaken this last for a human voice but ...
VOICE: (V.O.)
...if you still wish to speak to an
operator please press one...
Another beep.
VOICE : (V.O.)
Good evening welcome to the
Skytours sales desk...
BERGOGLIO: (V.O.)
Ah. Yes. I’m looking for a flight
from Rome to Lampedusa. Yes I know
I could book it on the internet.
I’ve only just moved here.
Name?

VOICE:

BERGOGLIO:
Bergoglio. Jorge Bergoglio.
VOICE:
Like the Pope.
BERGOGLIO:
Well ... yes ... in fact.
Postcode?

VOICE:

There’s a long pause.
VOICE:
Very funny.
The line goes dead.
INT. ST. MARTA CORRIDOR (2013) - DAY
Bergoglio opens his bedroom door and is amazed to find a
Swiss Guard standing outside.
Excuse me.

BERGOGLIO:

The guard does not speak.
BERGOGLIO: (CONT’D)
Are you supposed to stand there all
night?
SWISS GUARD 2:
Yes, Holy Father.
BERGOGLIO:
Do you know how to get the wifi in
here? I need to book a flight and
apparently it can only be done
online. I’d be really grateful if
you could help...
The Guard takes his cell phone from his pocket...
SWISS GUARD 2:
Of course, Holy Father...Where to?
Lampedusa

BERGOGLIO:

SWISS GUARD 2:
How many seats ?
Just me.

BERGOGLIO

SWISS GUARD 2:
Would they let you go alone, Holy
father?

CAPTION:

Summer, 2014

BENEDICT at his desk, he begins to write - he's working on a
new huge theological book. A knock on the door.
Enter POPE FRANCIS - wearing his SAN LORENZO FOOTBALL SCARF,
carrying the tray with media-lunas.
121

BERGOGLIO:
Sorry to disturb you. I just
thought you’d like to try these.
Ratzinger tries one.
BERGOGLIO:
Media lunas. They’re the classic
Argentinian treat. What d’you
think?
Ratzinger nods as he finishes it.
RATZINGER
How are you, Holy Father?
BERGOGLIO:
Adjusting, Holy Father.
What are you writing?
RATZINGER
Replying to a journalist who
believes God is nonsense, and
belief in God the source of all
evil. He has written me 30
intelligent questions. He would
like to publish my reply. Do I
have your permission?
POPE FRANCIS raises an eye-brow:
BERGOGLIO
“Silence incarnate”?
BENEDICT shrugs.

The two men smile.

EXT. VATICAN GARDEN / GROTTO OF OUR LADY OF LOURDES (2014) SUNSET
The two POPES walk in the gardens, swapping trade secrets. We

I cannot relax, Holy Father, until
I know the outcome...

wearing his FOOTBALL SCARF.
Is the World Cup Final between Germany and Argentina!
Bergoglio and Ratzinger sing their NATIONAL ANTHEMS along
with their teams.
Footage of the Game... 0-0, scoreless. Missed shots on goal.
The GERMAN player, SWEINSTEIGER, has a head knock and his
face is covered in BLOOD.
Bergoglio seems quite pleased with the injury to the
dangerous Sweinsteiger. When Ratzinger looks to Bergoglio to
denounce the violence, Bergoglio shrugs “that’s football.”
Ratzinger takes an increasing interest in the game...and
Bergoglio starts to become a little annoyed by the unexpected
enthusiasm.

engaged in the result...

takes the ball on his chest, then flips it over the KEEPER
into the GOAL. GERMANY 1 - ARGENTINA 0
While Bergoglio’s world comes crashing down - Ratzinger
becomes super-animated, even FIST-PUMPING in CELEBRATION,
much to Francis's chagrin, who tries but fails to smile.
In the EXCITEMENT, Bergoglio almost topples the COFFEE TABLE.
Ratzinger, as a precaution, extinguishes the SMALL CANDLE
that sits there.
CLOSE ON: The SMOKE from the EXTINGUISHED CANDLE, rising up,
up, up, heavenward, in a fine black trail.
