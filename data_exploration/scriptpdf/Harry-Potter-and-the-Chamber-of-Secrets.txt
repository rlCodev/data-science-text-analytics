Harry pages through a SCRAPBOOK, stops on a MOVING PHOTO
of Ron and Hermione. SQUAWK! Harry jumps. HEDWIG pecks
at the LOCK slung through her cage door, then glowers at
Harry.
HARRY
I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed
to use magic outside of school.
Besides, if Uncle Vernon -At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.

While AUNT PETUNIA puts the finishing touches to a
PUDDING of WHIPPED CREAM and SUGARED VIOLETS, UNCLE
VERNON struggles with DUDLEY'S BOW TIE, all the while
glowering at Harry.
UNCLE VERNON
I warned you. If you can't
control that bloody bird, it'll
have to go.
HARRY
She's bored. If I could just let
her out for an hour or two -UNCLE VERNON

messages to your freaky little
friends? No, sir.

HARRY
But I haven't gotten any messages.
From any of my friends. Not one.
All summer.
DUDLEY
Who'd want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON
I should think you'd be more
grateful. We raise you since you
were a baby, give you food off our
table, even let you have Dudley's
second bedroom... purely out of
the goodness of our hearts.
DUDLEY
I thought he got the second
bedroom because Mum was afraid
he'd turn us into dung beetles if
you put him back in the cupboard
under the stairs.

AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle
Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the
pudding.
AUNT PETUNIA
Not yet, popkin. That's for when
the Masons arrive.
UNCLE VERNON
Which should be any moment. Now.
Let's run through our schedule one
more time. Petunia, when the
Masons get here, you will be -AUNT PETUNIA

them graciously to our home.

Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning

Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill of his

Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.

As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES
FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle. Harry tumbles into the
darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other
reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible
second.
Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls
harder. Ron braces himself, pulls back. Harry hangs,
stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled
steel bars.

PLAYING CARDS that. A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLE

rat, SCABBERS. Ron shrugs, averts his eyes selfconsciously.

Crushing Cabinet.
Malfoy and his father enter. A stooped man (MR. BORGIN)

HERMIONE
Everyone's been so worried.

Hermione leads them to Gringotts, where Hermione's rather
nervous-looking Muggle parents stand with the Weasleys.
MR. WEASLEY
So you're dentists! Fascinating!
I understand other Muggles quite
fear you? Why is that?
MRS. WEASLEY
Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We
hoped you'd only gone one grate
too far. Come now. We're off to
Flourish and Blotts.

Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy
Lockhart's going to be there! We

seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the
photographer.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
(under his breath)
Nice big smile, Harry. Together,
you and I rate the front page.

Ladies and gentlemen! What an
extraordinary moment this is!
When young Harry here stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning
to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me -- which, incidentally
is celebrating its twenty-seventh
week atop The Daily Prophet's
Bestseller List -- he had no idea
that he would, in fact, be leaving

Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter.

Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shake
Harry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over the
fringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLT
SCAR. At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your
scar is legend. As, of course, is
the wizard who gave it to you.
HARRY
He was a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Yes, a pity about your parents.
Curious that you yourself should
escape with a mere flesh wound.
Curious, too, that you speak of
him in the past. Surely, you
don't think He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed is gone forever.
HARRY
His name is Voldemort.
Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.
LUCIUS MALFOY
You must be very brave, Mr.
Potter, to dare speak his name.
Or foolish.

Fear of a name only increases fear
of the thing itself.
Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring
defiantly.
LUCIUS MALFOY

Obviously not. Dear me. What's
the use of being a disgrace to the

Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid steps

rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles,
BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books. Two SEIZE Neville

What the... I don't believe it!
Crossing the courtyard from the other side are SEVEN BOYS

He called me a Mudblood.

HAGRID
Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then

It means dirty blood. Mudblood's
a really foul name for someone who

non-magic parents. Someone...
like me. It's not a term one
usually hears in civilized

HAGRID
Yeh see, Harry. There are some

Salazar Slytherin wished to be

admitted to Hogwarts. He believed
that magical learning should be

In other words, purebloods.
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.

According to legend, Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle, known as the Chamber of
Secrets. Shortly before
departing, he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school. The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within, and by so doing,
purge the school of all those who,
in Slytherin's view, were unworthy
to study magic.

wooden support beams that crisscross their path.
Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the

Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the

his good hand. Unable to control his broom with his
shattered arm, he hits the pitch with a SICKENING THUD.

TATTOOING the pitch again and again, only inches from
Harry. Calmly, Hermione strides forth, points her wand.

The Bludger hangs briefly in the air. Slowly ceases
spinning. Drops heavily to the pitch. Harry exhales,

watch.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
Gather round! Gather round! Can
everyone see me? Can you all hear
me? Excellent. In light of the
dark events of recent weeks,
Professor Dumbledore has granted
me permission to start this little
Dueling Club, to train you all up
in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done
on countless occasions -- for full
details, see my published works.
The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to
him.

Professor Snape has joined Lockhart.

Let me introduce my assistant
Professor Snape. He has
sportingly agreed to help me with
a short demonstration. Now I
don't want any of you youngsters
to worry. You'll still have your

Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes,

that, Professor Snape, but if you
don't mind my saying so, it was
very obvious what you were about
to do. If I had wanted to stop
you it would have been only too

Justin Finch-Fletchley. As students SCREAM, Harry -oddly calm -- approaches the snake. It rises, fangs
exposed, poised to strike Justin.
HARRY

Leave him!
The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.
HARRY

The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously -slumps to the floor. Harry blinks, as if coming out of a
trance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his hand
to Justin.

What are you playing at?
Terrified, Justin backs away. Confused, Harry eyes the
faces around him. Malfoy looks shocked. Seamus and
Neville's eyes glitter with fear. Ginny bolts the room.

warily. Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by
without a word.

I happen to be a prefect. You, on

DRACO
'Arthur Weasley, Head of the
Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office,
was today fined fifty Galleons for
bewitching a Muggle car. "Weasley
has brought the Ministry into
disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a
governor of Hogwarts. "He is
clearly unfit to draw up our laws
and his ridiculous Muggle
Protection Act should be scrapped
immediately."'
Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.
DRACO
Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so
much he should snap his wand in
half and go join them. You'd
never know the Weasleys were
purebloods, the way they behave.
Embarrassment to the wizarding
world. All of them.

Well, go to the hospital wing

reported all these attacks yet. I

it all up. He'll be sacked if it

said Dumbledore's the worst thing
that's ever happened to this place.
You're wrong!

Good one, Goyle. You're

Harry leans closer to

HARRY
Then you must have some idea who's
behind it all?

You know I haven't, Goyle. How

But my father did say this much:
It's been fifty years since the
Chamber was opened. He wouldn't
tell me who opened it -- only that
they were expelled -- but I know

of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood

Oh, yea.

HARRY
Look... we have to ask you
something. Do you know whoâs

Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer,
when... there is a LOUD KNOCK. The fruitcake SMASHES to
the floor. Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over
themselves. Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points
it at the door.
C-come in.

HAGRID
The door opens. A grim Dumbledore enters, followed by a
portly man in a pin-stripe suit and bowler: CORNELIUS
FUDGE.

My dear man, please believe me, I

house? I simply called at the
school and was told the Headmaster
was here.
DUMBLEDORE
And what exactly did you want with
me, Lucius?
LUCIUS MALFOY
Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but
the governors feel it's time for
you to step aside. This is an
Order of Suspension. You'll find
all twelve signatures on it. I'm
afraid we feel you're losing your
touch. What with all these
attacks, there'll be no Muggleborns left at Hogwarts. And we
all know what an awful loss that
would be.
Malfoy hands Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT.
FUDGE
Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore

we want right now... If Dumbledore
can't stop these attacks... I mean

An' how many did yeh have ter

LUCIUS MALFOY
I would advise you not to shout at

that I will only truly have left
this school when none here are
loyal to me. You will also find
that help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who... ask for
it.
Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Admirable sentiments. We shall
all miss your highly individual
way of running things, Albus, and
only hope your successor will
manage to prevent any more, um,

Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid.
Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath
and says carefully...
HAGRID
If anyone wanted ter find out some
stuff, all they'd have ter do is
follow the spiders. That'd lead

Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him
out. As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL,
scratching at the closed door. Harry and Ron emerge from
the cloak.
RON
Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore
gone, there'll be an attack a day.

Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows.
Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of
white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off
queasily. Harry peers up ahead: at the far end of the
hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING.
As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND
emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall
trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about
nervously.
RON
I don't have a good feeling about
this, Harry -Don't panic.

HARRY
As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR
suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE
SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.
SEES:
An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG), the size of a small elephant.
As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away. Then:
its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS. As if...
listening.
ARAGOG
You do not come from the forest.
Your hearts beat like... men.

Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you... you're...

ARAGOG
Hagrid has never sent men into our
hollow before.
HARRY
He's in trouble. Up at school,
there've been attacks. They think
it's Hagrid. They think he's
opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Like before.
As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then...
RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl
slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left.
Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.
ARAGOG
That's a lie! Hagrid never opend
the Chamber of Secrets!
HARRY
But if Hagrid never... that
means... you're not the monster.
ARAGOG
The monster was born in the
castle. I came from a distant
land, in the pocket of a traveler.
Ron turns. TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward.
Pause. Waiting. Watching.
Harry...

Ron points.

them fresh meat when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.

FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move
forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again: SPIDERS.

LIGHT ignites the hollow and the FORD ANGLIA comes
THUNDERING over the rim and down the slope, KNOCKING
SPIDERS OUT OF ITS PATH. As it SCREECHES to a halt, the
DOORS FLING OPEN.

Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY.
A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.
THE WINDOWS!

HARRY
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!

RON

I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK!
Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window.
Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE.
Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows
hold tight. As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the
hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his
SPIDER'S LEGS.

wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders
STAMPEDE after.

The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past
trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead,
SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one
narrow escape route.
HARRY
That way! It's the only way out!
(looking back)
Hurry! They're catching up!
Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA
drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as
good as dead.
HARRY
Can you get us in the air?
RON
(jostling the
gear stick)
Flying gear's jammed!
The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits
ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear
shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to
kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels
LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious
spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing
tarantula, then sails over the trees.

roam our land, none is more deadly
than the Basilisk. Capable of
living for hundreds of years,
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye. Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it.'

Ron! This is it! The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk. That's why I can hear
it speak. It's a snake.

But it kills by looking people in
the eye. Why is it no one's dead?
Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and
Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters

littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees
something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks,
his voice is hollow with dread.

Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry
shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY
SKIN.
RON
Bloody hell. Whatever shed this
must be twenty feet long. Or
more.
THUD!

They turn.

Lockhart has passed out.

RON
Heart of a lion, this one.
Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and,
quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to
his feet.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
The adventure ends here, boys!
But don't fret. The world will
know our story. How I was too
late to save the girl. How you
two tragically lost your minds at
the sight of her mangled body.
I'll even bind a limited edition
in this snake skin. Say goodbye
to your memories.
(raising Ron's wand)
Obliviate!
Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhart
OFF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into the
rock above. As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harry
the other. Harry sits up, squints through the settling
dust. A SOLID WALL of BROKEN ROCK seals the tunnel
between him and Ron. INTERCUT Harry and Ron.

INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT

A vast chamber stretches ahead. Along the path are rows
of STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of black
water. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN.
Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies
motionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms,
her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble. A
pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest.
Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on
the floor and kneels beside her. (BOLD ITALICS INDICATE
POSSIBLE FLASHBACKS.)

Ginny!

him through a misted window.
HARRY

mean, she won't wake? She's
not...
TOM RIDDLE
She's still alive. But only just.
HARRY
Are you a ghost?
TOM RIDDLE
A memory. Preserved in a diary
for fifty years.
Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his
own hand on Ginny's arm.
HARRY
She's cold as ice. You've got
to help me, Tom. There's a
basilisk -TOM RIDDLE
It won't come until it's called.

fingers.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes. I'm afraid so. But then,
she's been in so much pain, poor
Ginny. She's been writing to me
for months, telling me all her
pitiful worries and woes. Ginny
poured her soul out to me. I grew
stronger on a diet of her deepest
fears, her darkest secrets. I
grew powerful enough to start
feeding Ginny a few secrets, to
start pouring a bit of my soul
back into her...
Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins
cruelly.
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY
No... she couldn't -- she
wouldn't.
TOM RIDDLE
It was Ginny who set the Basilisk
on the Mudbloods and the Squib's
cat. Ginny who wrote threatening
messages on the walls.
HARRY
But... Why?...
TOM RIDDLE
Because I told her to. You'll
find that I can be very
persuasive. Not that she knew
what she was doing. She was,
shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her and she tried
to dispose of it in the girls'
bathroom. But then, who should
find it... but you. The very
person I was most anxious to meet.

TOM RIDDLE
Ginny told me all about you. I

you if I could. So I decided to
show you my capture of that
brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain
your trust.
HARRY
Hagrid's my friend. And you
framed him, didn't you?
TOM RIDDLE
It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent.
HARRY
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
through you.
TOM RIDDLE
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was
still at school. So I decided to
leave behind a diary, preserving
my sixteen-year-old self in its
pages, so that one day... I would
be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
HARRY
Well, you haven't finished it this
time. In a few hours Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again.
TOM RIDDLE
Haven't I told you, that killing
Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
anymore? For many months now, my
new target has been... you.

Afraid I'd tell you just who it

those roosters.
Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE,
then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.
TOM RIDDLE
Come now, Harry. Don't look so
disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded
in destroying the diary, she would
have destroyed me. And we
couldn't be having this little
talk. And I have so many
questions for you.
Like what?

HARRY
TOM RIDDLE
Well, how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you
escape with nothing but a scar,
while Lord Voldemort's powers were
destroyed?
HARRY
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.
TOM RIDDLE
Voldemort is my past, present and
future.
Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to
trace it through the air, writing three words: "TOM
MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them:
"I AM LORD VOLDEMORT."
HARRY
You. You're the heir of
Slytherin. You're Voldemort?

I became the greatest sorcerer in
the world.

Albus Dumbledore is the greatest
sorcerer in the world!
TOM RIDDLE
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of
me.
HARRY
He'll never be gone! Not as long
as those who remain are loyal to
him!
Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep
within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over
the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The
bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE
in its golden talons.

Fawkes.

HARRY

Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which
is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.
TOM RIDDLE

This is what Dumbledore sends his
defender! A songbird and an old
hat!
Riddle tosses aside the hat. He turns to the statue of
Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.
TOM RIDDLE
(Parseltongue)
Speak to me, Slytherin.
Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS. There is a
RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING.
Harry turns away. The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills
out, uncoiling heavily to the floor. Harry turns to the
wall. The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall.

The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward.

Harry turns, RUNS away.

TOM RIDDLE
Parseltongue won't save you now,

Don't look. Don't look into its

Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent
is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES.
Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike.
Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk
and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE
SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife,
driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering
eyes.
As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall,
the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away,
its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS:
the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.

As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING

Yes, Potter. The process is
nearly complete. In a few
minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead. And I will cease to be a
memory. Lord Voldemort will
return. Very much... alive.

Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK
SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of
Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then -impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue
of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but
Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what
glitters within: the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.
Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of
courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN
its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee,
Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS
BARED... STRIKES.
Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the
SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as
it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his
arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,
watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes
STILL.
Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang
free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His
eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.
TOM RIDDLE
Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
the venom of the Basilisk
penetrates the body? If you have
any final words, Potter, you'd
best speak them now. I'd guess
you have little more than a minute
to live.

turns a troubling gray.

TOM RIDDLE
What are you doing? No.

Riddle's face creases in fear. He LUNGES FORWARD. But
Harry is too quick. Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES
THE FANG into the book. Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from
the pages.

No!

TOM RIDDLE

Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to
wither instantly, growing BLURRY once more. As the ink
runs off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHES

MOAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As she
sees Harry, she SOBS.

INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

137

Fear and suspicion banished, the House tables abuzz with
excitement and anticipation... all except the Slytherins,
who do not share the general feeling.

Seated at the tables, are the formerly petrified, revived
students. Justin Finch-Fletchley joins his fellow
Hufflepuffs. Colin Creevey SNAPS photos of the
proceedings.
At the rear of the hall, standing near the entrance,
Filch is reunited with Mrs. Norris. Then... Hermione
enters, searching the room for Harry and Ron. Finally,
she sees them. Smiles. Runs forward and embraces Harry.
HERMIONE
You solved it! You solved it!
HARRY
With loads of help from you.
She turns to embrace Ron. They pause, an awkward moment
between them and... shake hands instead.
RON
Welcome back, Hermione.
McGonagall taps her goblet.

Dumbledore stands.

DUMBLEDORE
Before we begin our feast, let's
give a round of applause to
Professor Sprout and Madame
Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has
been successfully administered to
all those who had been petrified.
Everyone applauds.
DUMBLEDORE
Also, in the wake of recent
events, as a school treat, all
exams have been cancelled.
Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.
Oh, no!

HERMIONE
At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's
Hagrid. He enters. Stops. Looks around. The room
falls SILENT. All eyes upon him. He glances around.
Nervous. Embarrassed.
HAGRID
Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin'
my release papers got all lost 'n
confused. Some ruddy bird named
Errol.

Ron exchanges a nervous glance with Dumbledore. Hagrid
looks at all of the faces staring at him. He turns to
Harry.
HAGRID
I jus' want to say... that if it
wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an'
Ron... and Hermione... Well, I
jus' want to say... Thanks.
HARRY
There's no Hogwarts without you,
Hagrid.
Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly...
brings his hands together. The others join him. Soon,
everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING. As the
students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes,
and...
CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the
celebration. WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a
WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the
night.
FADE TO BLACK.
