INT. UNKNOWN BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Sex. Flashes of it. A black screen, then short rhythmic
bursts. Clothes. Skin. Hair. Peter and a woman. No
sound. No, wait, there is a sound: one person breathing.
But it’s not the lovers. It’s...

INT. ALICIA’S APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

...ALICIA wide awake in bed, staring overhead at a crack in
the ceiling. Her mind preoccupied with images of sex and...
...the press conference. Flashes of cameras. Peter’s hand.
The podium. His speech. All from her POV. Alicia closes
her eyes, tries to squeeze the images away when...
Mom.
Oh, right.

GRACE (O.S.)
Breakfast.

Time to start her day.

Alicia gets up, and...

PLAINTIFF
Why are you doing this?
Alicia looks up. In the middle of a deposition now. Her
laptop in front of her. Just four people and an unmanned
video camera crammed into a tiny conference room. A
PLAINTIFF, his LAWYER, a COURT REPORTER.
ALICIA
Doing what, Mr. Dykman?
PLAINTIFF
Asking questions you know the answer to.
(Alicia nods to the court
reporter to stop)
No, let’s get this down. SheffrinMarks is using you to delay us. To
keep from paying us. Is that why
you went to law school, to do this?
Alicia stares at him. He’s right. But an ASSISTANT enters,
slides a NOTE to Alicia. One word scrawled: “Upstairs.”
ALICIA
Do you know what this...?
“...is about.” But the rushing Assistant is already out the
door. Alicia turns to the plaintiff:

Bran’, Kyle, Brittany in contracts.
He nods toward two JUNIOR ASSOCIATES, young as the Jonas
Brothers. An intense pacing BLONDE who looks 18.
ALICIA
Thanks, Cary. I’m just-- I have to

And they arrive at the upstairs conference room where WILL
gestures to Alicia: come on in. Right, she nods to Cary,
enters, as Cary watches her cross and sit behind the
partners. Curious. What’s he missing out on? And we’re...

INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

...inside now. Four people dwarfed by the large room. Will,
DIANE, an ASSISTANT, and a YOUNG WOMAN across from them. A
client? An employee? A walk-in? Mid-conversation:
DIANE
And when did you say this was?
June 15th.

CHRISTY
Four months ago.

WILL
Do you have anything with the date?
CHRISTY
A parking receipt.
She reaches into an accordion folder as Alicia peers past
Will and Diane at her: CHRISTY BARBOSA (22). The most
striking thing about her is how striking she is. A dark
Angelina Jolie beauty trying to play down her looks with a
clipped over-studied voice, short hair, glasses. No accent.
DIANE
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
CHRISTY
No, I’d seen his family on the
news; I heard about their hotels
and stuff, but that’s about it.
Alicia eyes Will and Diane: what is this? Contractual dispute?
Wrongful termination? But Alicia sees Christy look toward her,
recognizing her. Quick eye contact. Then her eyes move on.
WILL
Well, the problem here, Christy, is
any civil suit could be seen as...
opportunistic.
CHRISTY
Because of their money?
Yes.

“Rape?”

Will and Diane exhale outside, see Alicia exit to join them.
DIANE
Alicia, if you don’t mind, we just need-WILL
No, it’s alright.

Stay.

Diane looks at Will. He’s serious. Okay, she nods; and
Alicia joins them, listening. Hushed...
WILL (CONT’D)
I don’t know about this. It’s a
criminal case, not a civil one.
DIANE
Except the State’s Attorney rejected
the charges-WILL
Because it has Duke lacrosse
written all over it-DIANE
Oh, come on!
WILL
What come on? Put your politics
aside, Diane. You’re Glenn Childs,
and you get this dropped in your lap-a stripper at a bachelor party
accusing the son of the most powerful
family in Chicago of rape-- and you
don’t think it’s Duke lacrosse II-Alicia listens, finally getting some sense of this.
DIANE
He’s worried about the McKeon
family money; he’s worried about
their campaign contributions-WILL
Diane, we’re overextended. How many
Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?

like she’s trying to make some
quick cash from the McKeon family.
DIANE
Do you believe her?
WILL
I believe a lot of things I can’t prove.
Will, for the first time, looks toward Alicia, who surprises
herself by silently siding with Diane. After a second...
WILL (CONT’D)
Okay, here’s what I think.
the McKeon family lawyer.
Ericcson?

I know

DIANE

WILL
Right, William Ericcson.
(smiles: history there)
That’s all we need-- two Wills. The
McKeons are gonna want to keep this out
of the press-- even if he didn’t do it-so my guess is they throw her some cash- $50,000 or so-- just to keep her
quiet. Let’s see what I can get.
Diane thinks about it. Nods. Agreed. She reenters the
conference room as Will starts off, getting on his cell. He
turns back, nods to Alicia to accompany him. On his cell:
WILL (CONT’D)
Mr. Ericcson please. Tell him it’s
the other Will.
(to Alicia)
I want you to be there. Don’t say
anything. Just listen. And look
serious.
ALICIA
I can do that.
Will smiles.

Who?
Christy.

ALICIA
I... don’t.
WILL
You--? So why did she ask for you

Alicia stares at him oddly-- no idea-- but someone comes on

confused, continuing down the stairs.

Alicia, back in the now empty deposition room, stares at her
laptop. A link blinking there. She hates this. Starts to
close the laptop. Then-- can’t help it-- hits the link.
Streaming video. A SPOKESMAN making a statement on courthouse
steps...
APPELATE SPOKESMAN
“Two months ago Peter Florrick was
sentenced to ten years for bribery
and corruption. Today was the
first step toward his release.”
An “Early Show” report. It cuts to: library footage of Peter
in his glory. A CORRESPONDENT in Voice Over:
CBS CORRESPONDENT (V.O.)
He was known in Chicago simply as
“The Hammer”...
PETER FLORRICK
“I don’t care who you are, you commit
a crime in my town, I will find you.”

The iconic footage of Peter and Alicia at his resignation:
PETER FLORRICK
“But I do admit to a failure of
judgment in my private dealings
with these women...”
CBS CORRESPONDENT (V.O.)
Within weeks, Chicago’s
incorruptible States Attorney found
himself with all the trappings of
modern American scandal...

...a law man in hot pursuit...
(shots of the following)
...an embarrassed wife... a blushing
call girl... and an R-rated sex tape.
A typed out version of the audio tape plays as we hear sex:
AMBER (V.O.)
...Does she do this for you?...
PETER FLORRICK (V.O.)
...oh god, please, you-Click-- Alicia hits pause.

Still hurts.

KALINDA
Ever heard the whole thing?
Alicia, startled, finds Kalinda at her door.
questions seem to be her forte.
Nope.

Casually rude

ALICIA

KALINDA
You’re the only one who hasn’t.
Yep.

Kalinda nods, drops a file on her desk, a photo of Lloyd
McKeon on the top...

ERICCSON

Laughing taunts. WILLIAM ERICCSON

Think Bradley Whitford. Loves a good joke, hates to lose.
WILL
Come on, you don’t even believe that.
Will. The two laugh.
At a power lunch spot. Red brick,
racing waiters, and old money. Sitting with them...
...Alicia looks toward the other two people at the table.
LAWYERS from Ericcson’s firm. Silent and funny as
mannequins. They stare back at Alicia. Stepford lawyers.
ERICCSON
So, this is driving me crazy.

Alicia.

Being spoken to.
Yes.

Oh.

She points to herself.

ERICCSON (CONT’D)

No. Alicia is actually our newest
Junior Associate: one month in.

Ericcson looks to Will incredulously, then smiles at Alicia.

WILL
So why don’t we talk about Lloyd McKeon?
ERICCSON
(still studying Alicia)
It’s sad, really. I remember when
you had a respectable firm, Will, one
that didn’t sink to scurrilous
charges like these.
WILL
What charges might those be, Will?
I haven’t said anything yet.
ERICCSON
(smiles)
Look, do you think you’re the first
firm she’s been shopping this
lawsuit to? There’s nothing there.
Even the States Attorney-(nods to Alicia)
--the new States Attorney thinks
there’s nothing there-WILL
And yet I got you to a settlement
lunch on a half hour’s notice.
Ericcson smiles.

Two pros keeping their “tells” to a minimum.

ERICCSON
Mrs. Florrick, what do you say to
someone bringing unsubstantiated
sexual charges against a public
figure in order to gain an advantage?
Will opens his mouth, but Alicia is already answering:
ALICIA
You want to know what I would say?
I do.

ERICCSON

Will’s foot nudges up alongside Alicia: careful.
ALICIA
I’d say you’re trying to change the
subject from rape.

hands: guilty as charged, as Will relaxes-- good. To Will:
ERICCSON
I would agree that, as offensive and
misguided as these charges are, the
optics don’t exactly play in our
favor. So we’re willing to tender a
cursory offer.
Ericcson writes a number on a post-it note, slides it across
to Will who opens it. Alicia leans slightly, reads $450,000.
Alicia and Will don’t react-- work hard not to react. Wow.

Alicia and Will walk away from the restaurant.
Then an aside to Will...

A second.

ALICIA
McKeon did it.
Will pauses, nods:
WILL
If it had been under a hundred thou’, I
would’ve said “no.” Over a hundred thou’...
ALICIA
What about “well over?”
Will looks at her.

Christy sits across from Alicia. Waiting. In silence. They
look toward the glass wall. Will and Diane outside discussing.
ALICIA
If you don’t mind my asking, Miss
Barbosa, why did you ask for me?
CHRISTY
I saw you on TV.
(realizes that needs more)
I thought you’d understand... What
it’s like to be... misunderstood.
Alicia nods.

A flicker of sympathy.

Will and Diane enter:

A first. It’s a cash settlement.
$450,000.
Christy stares at them:
CHRISTY
You’re kidding. We don’t have to
go to court? He just offered that?
WILL
Yes, you’ll have to sign a standard
confidentiality agreement. Both parties
free each other of liability and agree not
to speak to anyone including the press.
What?

CHRISTY

DIANE
It’s standard in civil agreements.
CHRISTY
Yes, but-- I want everybody to know he
settled. Can’t we tell the police?
DIANE
Not if we sign a confidentiality
agreement. McKeon could withdraw the
award and sue you for defamation.
Christy considers it, turns to Alicia...
CHRISTY
What do you think?
Alicia. Suddenly all eyes on her. Diane starts to interrupt,
but Will shakes his head: let her go.
ALICIA
You are looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we
don’t expect. If you take this money,
the settlement will be known to the two
people who matter most. You and him.
Will nods to Alicia. Even Diane seems unfussily pleased.
Christy pauses, considers it. A quiet authority:
CHRISTY
I’m sorry, no. He’ll know how much
it costs to rape somebody and get
away with it, that’s all.

Christy breaks eggs into a pan. In her small, hygienically

CHRISTY
You have to size these things up
pretty quickly. This one seemed...
cool. A downtown hotel suite.
Twelve clients. Stockbroker types.
No one out of control. Easy.
Kalinda and Alicia shoot confused looks toward an OLDER WOMAN

Alicia smiles-- human-- but Kalinda continues on, brusquely:

Alicia slumps almost imperceptibly.

Not a good turn.

CHRISTY
I haven’t gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship; I

KALINDA
Yes, that’s my point, thanks. She
lied to us. Why believe her now?

Because she walked away from a half
million dollars-- and when did she
