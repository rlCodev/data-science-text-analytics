ANIMATION SEQUENCE (NOTE: STILL TRYING STUFF!)

1

"Love is simply the name for the desire and pursuit of
the whole." - Plato, The Symposium
A BLANK SHEET OF PARCHMENT.
ELLIE (V.O.)
The Ancient Greeks believed humans
once had four arms, four legs, and
a single head made of two faces.
GRAVEL emerges from the center of the page and “crushes” into
BLACK POWDER which forms the base for CHARCOAL STROKES.
Animated STROKES illustrate a TWIN-BEING.
ELLIE (V.O.)
We were happy. Complete.
A CHARCOAL HEART encircles the twin-being. Both faces smile.
ELLIE (V.O.)
So complete that the gods - fearing
our wholeness would quell our need
for worship - cleaved us in two...
The page TEARS in half; the Twin-Being is SPLIT!
ELLIE (V.O.)
...leaving our split-selves to
wander the earth in misery, forever
longing...
ZOOM IN on one of the halves as it wanders the earth CRYING.
The strokes of its body morph into a lonely CAVE PAINTING
FIGURE, also crying.
ELLIE (V.O.)
...longing...
Morph into the “Mona Lisa”...crying. “The Scream”... crying.
ELLIE (V.O.)
...longing...
Morph into a classic black and white movie with a closeup of
an actress, you guessed it: crying.

ELLIE (V.O.)
...for the other half of our soul.

From cave paintings to Ingrid Bergman. So many tears.
ELLIE (V.O.)
It is said that when one half finds
its other...
Pull out to reveal: the reverse shot to that classic movie!
Lover’s eyes meet! Each reverts back to their split-being.
ELLIE (V.O.)
...there is an unspoken
understanding, a unity - and each
would know no greater joy than
this.
A classic KISS. Music SWELLS as the charcoal halves converge
into a BIG ANIMATED CHARCOAL HEART...
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKERS - MORNING
A CRAPPY GRAFFITI HEART on a high school wall.
Two seniors joined as one by the lips.
ELLIE (V.O.)
Of course, the Ancient Greeks never
went to high school.
BELL RINGS. The seniors break apart like it was nothing.
SENIOR GUY
Good hangout.
Whatever.

SENIOR GIRL

Both pull out phones, part ways.
ELLIE (V.O.)
Or they’d realize...
Sound of the MORNING BELL dissolves into...

...the BLAST of a TRAIN WHISTLE... growing LOUDER...
CLOSE ON the FACE OF A GIRL, 17, pressed against a LAPTOP
KEYBOARD, her body curled around a copy of PLATO’S SYMPOSIUM,
fast asleep inside a frosted TICKET BOOTH. She jerks awake.
Crap.

ELLIE

This is ELLIE CHU.
She bolts out of the booth.
On her computer screen we see (and hear in voiceover):
ELLIE (V.O.)
We don’t need the gods to mess
things up for us.
A PASSING TRAIN wipes frame...

EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - MOMENTS LATER

SERIES OF CLOSEUP SHALLOW-FOCUS SHOTS:
- ELLIE’S HEAD POPS OUT OF A SWEATER
ELLIE (V.O.)
If you ask me...
- TWO FROZEN SWANSON CHICKEN PIES ON THE COUNTER
ELLIE (V.O.)
...people spend far too much time
looking for someone to complete
them.
A fork jabs holes into the tops of the pies.

ELLIE (V.O.)
How many people find perfect love?

- LONE SOCK UNDER A BENCH. FINGERS REACH IN VAIN.
ELLIE (V.O.)
Or if they do... make it last?
Angle on half of Ellie coming out from under the bench, one
sock on, one bare foot. Drift over to a BURSTING BAG OF DIRTY
LAUNDRY... Drift further to an ALTAR for HER DEAD MOTHER. We
linger on a PHOTO OF HER MOTHER: young, laughing, striking
the same pose as the STATUE of BOB’S BIG BOY just behind her.
ELLIE (V.O.)
More evidence of Camus’ theory that
life is irrational and meaningless.
- A PRINTER spits out a page on which is written:
“...Camus’ theory that life is irrational and meaningless.”
A HAND grabs the page, signing “Trig Carson, AP English”.
CUT to ANOTHER PAPER. On its last page:
“We don’t need the gods to mess things up for us.”
The hand signs - in new penmanship - “Todd Ball, English”
Papers are tossed onto a stack.
- ON COVERS GENTLY BEING PULLED OVER EDWIN CHU, 50’s, snoring
in a LA-Z-BOY.
ELLIE (V.O.)
And that, my friends, is some A+
love philosophy right there.
In the deep background, Ellie tiptoes out.
- CHECKS OFF A LIST BY THE DOOR: “Long underwear” (check)
“Defrost pies” (check) “Laundry” (does NOT check) “Stay Away
From Boys” (check) “Have Good Day” (check)
ELLIE (V.O.)
Or A-, if Mrs. G is in a bad mood.
The door slams behind her.

A dilapidated sign announces: “It’s Happening In SQUAHAMISH!”
The sign rusts in an empty field.
Ellie speeds past on her bike toward a viaduct.

EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN/CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOMENTS 7
LATER
The road continues past a small CATHOLIC CHURCH. Outside, a
Man with a SIGN: “JESUS IS COMING. ARE YOU READY?”
FATHER SHANLEY, 90’s, stands in the doorway bellowing:
FATHER SHANLEY
“Outside are the dogs the sorcerers
the immoral persons and everyone
WHO LOVES AND PRACTICES LYING!”
Ellie flies by.

EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN/CARSON GRAVEL SIGN MOMENTS LATER

A giant granite sign heralds “CARSON GRAVEL. We’re more than
just gravel!”
Ellie huffs past it up a hill and around the bend.

A TRUCK rips by, a group of OBNOXIOUS TEEN BOYS heckle from
the pick-up truck:
OBNOXIOUS TEENS
ELLIE CHUUU! Chugga-chugga-chuggachugga, Chugga chugga... CHU CHU!
They tear off, laughing.
Ellie presses on toward the peak...
...and coasts down the other side.
We lift up to see this former mining town in its faded glory.
A SWELL OF OFF-KEY SINGING from a STUDENT CHOIR.

A handsome, pained DEACON JAY FLORES brings it to a close.
DEACON FLORES
Fantastic. The angels weep with
joy.

Hidden in the corner: Ellie at a keyboard, adjacent to the
BAND. She sneaks a term paper into the folds of a songbook,
sends it down the reed section.
On Ellie’s phone: “HushMo: Todd B. sent you $20.”

*

DEACON FLORES (CONT’D)
Few announcements. Once again: wall
tubas have to be checked out before
use. These are delicate instruments
with sticky valves...

*

Songbooks travel the room. HushMo notifications roll in.

*

As the Deacon waxes on, we see kids on their phones.
One SHY BOY OBOIST types out: “Wanna go to OKTOBER FLING?”...
... which appears on a TROMBONIST’S SCREEN. She forwards...
...to three of her friends who roll eyes...
...one posts a SCREENSHOT with caption “#nerdalert”.
Snickers throughout the room.
DEACON FLORES (CONT’D)
Is there a problem?
WHOLE CLASS (EN MASSE)
No, Deacon Flores.

DEACON FLORES
(beat) As I was saying, please keep
your reeds lubricated. Next up,
Winter Talent Show. Mandatory for
all seniors, last chance to strut
your stuff, again, mandatorily...

Shy Boy Oboist melts into his seat, beet-red.
Ellie’s eyes travel past him into the CHOIR, where a group of
rich kids (QUADDIES) buzz around a TALL HANDSOME BOY, 17.
This is TRIG CARSON. Gravel money.

Trig drapes his arm around A GIRL, 17, glued to her
songbook... which hides her phone. THIS IS ASTER FLORES.
DEACON FLORES (CONT’D)
Let’s all turn to page 49...
He lifts his baton. Aster reluctantly shuts her book,
prepares to sing.
ELLIE (V.O.)
In case you haven’t guessed, this
is not a love story.
Ellie’s eyes stay on Aster. Aster’s voice rings out pure...
ELLIE (V.O.)
Or not one where anyone gets what
they want.
...and travels out the window, where we hear...
COACH (O.S.)
ARE YOU MEN, OR ARE YOU LOSERS?

EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - TRACK - SAME TIME

...a PACK OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS stampede in a CLOUD OF DUST.
One BROAD-SHOULDERED BOY lags behind, staring at the window,
transfixed. This is PAUL MUNSKY, 17.
MUNSKY!

COACH (O.S.)

He tosses a last glance over his shoulder... starts running.

INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

12

Your basic school hallway jungle between bells. The populars,
the not-so-populars... high-fives, side-eye, dismissals.
MRS. G. (O.S.)
Notice the lack of fire and
brimstone in No Exit. No torture
devices necessary...
Unnoticed in the swirl of activity is Ellie, staring at a
poster labeled “SENIOR RECITAL SIGN-UPS - MANDATORY.”
MRS. G. (O.S.) (CONT’D)
We are the source of our own hell.

“Hell is other people. -- John-Paul Sartre, NO EXIT.”
BELL RINGS.
MRS. GESELSCHAP, 60’s, sinks back into her chair.
MRS. G.
500 words on Sartre’s use of
thwarted desire. Monday.
Students stream out, Ellie the last to leave.
MRS. G. (CONT’D)
Six different takes on Plato.
Impressive.
ELLIE
(innocent) Just the one.
MRS. G.
Sure, sure, that’s what I tell the
bartender.
Ellie laughs. Pulls out a stack of books to return.
ELLIE
How come you’ve never turned me in?
MRS. G.
And have to read the actual essays
they’d write? (makes face)
Mrs. G slides over a new stack of books. On top: an
APPLICATION FOR GRINNELL COLLEGE.
ELLIE
You know I’m going to “E-Dub.”
MRS. G.
Damn shame.
ELLIE
Damn “full-ride.” I can live at
home. Plus, I get to stay in lovely
Squahamish.

Mrs. G shoots her a look.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
It’s not that good either. But it’s
what’s happening.
MRS. G.
I spent four of the best years of
my life at Grinnell.
ELLIE
And look at you, back home in Hellquamish.
MRS. G.
You’re right. Stay away from the
liberal arts.
Ellie laughs and stuffs the application in her bookbag.
ELLIE
Try not to get fired over the
weekend.
MRS. G.
Are you kidding? Everyone in this
town fears God. You know who God
fears? (smug) Teacher’s Union.
Ellie shakes her head fondly, and is gone.

Ellie pedals home from school.

A BREATHLESS PAUL appears in frame. He grabs onto Ellie’s
saddlebag, bringing her down.
ELLIE
What is wrong with you??
Sorry I-

PAUL

He dry-heaves from exertion. Still coughing, he digs into his
KNAPSACK... pulls out a bratwurst. Stuffs it into his mouth
and keeps rummaging.
Ellie sighs. She knows what this is.
ELLIE
$10 for 3 pages. $20, 3 to 10. Not

It’s not- I’m not tryna to cheatELLIE
Nobody is. Which class is it for?

She opens it, curious...
INSERT: THE LETTER. “Dear Aster Flores...”
She shoves it back.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
I can’t help you.
PAUL
I just need a few words. Good ones.
ELLIE
I’m not writing to Aster Fl- to
some girl. It’d be wrong. A letter
is personal. It’s supposed to be
authentic.
PAUL
That would be awesome!
ELLIE
No, I can’t be you being authentGives up. Mounts her bike.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
Get a thesaurus. Use spell-check.
Good luck, Romeo.
Pedals off.
PAUL

She’s gone.
He hurls his KNAPSACK to the ground. Takes a resigned bite of
his bratwurst.

... SLAMMING right into TRIG AND HIS QUADDIES, who walk
through her, oblivious. Books, papers, bag go flying.
She scrambles to gather her things.

Aster has stooped down. To help.

can’t handle mediocre accompanists even if they are saved.

They stand. Aster glances at the book she picked up.
ASTER (CONT’D)
“Remains of the Day”. Loved it. All
that barely repressed longing.
She pops it on top of Ellie’s stack... and is gone.

CUSTOMER SERVICE (OVER PHONE)
Yes I know. Your bill is 3 months
overdue, Mrs. Chu. If we don’t get
a minimum payment of $50, your
power will terminate tomorrow.
Ellie stands alone in the hallway, as the LAST BELL RINGS,
staring into nothingness. Suddenly, at the end of the hall:
PAUL appears, searching... finds her! Is she gonna run again?
On a desperate Ellie, considering.

girl. But even if you were only two
of those things, I’d be into it.
But your like all three. Just to be

She looks up at Paul: What is this?
PAUL
She’s like - all three.
ELLIE
Thanks for clarifying.
She goes back to the letter.

“About me. I am kind of cute. Some
people think I’m the cutest one in

about my dead grandma. All I am

The thing about No Exit is it’s

the fourth son, and my family has
made the same dogs for 49 years,
and doesn’t matter that we’re going
out of style or broke - it’s Nana’s
recipe, and if my Ma can’t have her
Nana, at least she can keep making
her sausages, and if I break away,
I’d break her heart, and it’s her
heart or mine so... I stay.

Engineering. PhD, no less.
PAUL
So he became... the Station Manager

To start. Plan was to be promoted

How she twirls her hair when she’s

like she can’t help herself and she
stops being so... PERFECT for just

Hey! Look at you.

PAUL
I dunno. We got milkshakes and
fries and held hands and it was...
quiet and... (realizes) nice.
He relives that moment.

Then she had curfew so we walked to

Ellie looks at the guitar. At the crowd. Back at Paul.
She turns around on the bench. Closes her eyes. Starts to
play “Half Way.” Her voice starts shaky... then steadies...
finishing pure and clear and strong.
It is dead silent in the auditorium.

Ellie is startled. What is happening?

Paul sighs, opens one of the Yakults. “Feeds” Ellie.
So good.

ELLIE (CONT’D)

PAUL
(”pay attention”) HEY.
What?

ELLIE

She has a Yakult mustache. Paul struggles to find the words.
Then takes her by the shoulders... and LAYS ONE ON HER.
Ellie’s eyes bug out. Yakults topple to the floor.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PAUL
YOU DON’T WANT ME TO KISS YOU?
NO!

ELLIE

A lone Yakult rolls to a stop.

ASTER
Forgive me father for I have
sinned. It’s been 48 days since my
last confession. I had feelings for
someone who wasn’t my boyfriend. I
didn’t tell you. Or God. Or my
boyfriend. I kept it for myself. I
was selfish. And maybe love is
selfish. It’s having this secret
stashed in you, until one day it
feels like someone else has that
same secret and suddenly this thing
you didn’t even know you held feels
full and amazing and real… But it
turns out to be a lie. And you’re
left lonelier than ever. So I’ll do
whatever Hail Mary’s you deem fit.
But whatever punishment you give
me, it can’t be worse than this
feeling. Because even now... he’s
the only one I want to talk to. And
it’s like he doesn’t even exist.

Aster slips out of the booth.
Father Shanley, mournful, looks slowly to his other side...
to reveal a hidden ELLIE, knees up, heartbroken.

You don’t see her.
Edwin stares at him.
EDWIN
See... her?
PAUL
Who she is. Could be. Her.
Paul slumps against the wall.
Edwin is quiet.
EDWIN (IN MANDARIN)
When Ellie’s Ma died, I lost my
mind. I didn’t move for days. When
I finally “woke”, I found Ellie in
the booth, doing the switch. She
looked up at me. Just 13. So
serious. And I... smiled. After
that, she took over. And I let her.

Our final reading today is from
Trig Carson.
Trig stands in the audience, clears his throat.
TRIG
“Love is patient, love is kind. It
does not envy, it does not boast,
it is not proud...” Which is why I
love this little lady.
He gestures to a startled Aster sitting one row behind.
TRIG (CONT’D)
And why she’ll make me a fantastic
wife. Aster, will you?
Wave of approval ripples through the crowd.
Aster, frozen, gives the barest of nods.
The congregation bursts into applause.
NO!

ELLIE

Gasps. Every head turns back to the balcony.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
Uh. I uh...
So many eyes on her.

But it SUCKS.

PAUL
And I’ve been thinking about how
much it would suck to have to

whole life.
He’s careful not to look at Ellie. But he’s speaking to her.
PAUL (CONT’D)
I always thought there was one way
to love. But there’s more. So many
more than I knew. And I never want
to be the guy who stops loving
someone... for loving the way they
want to love.
His voice has never been stronger. Ellie’s eyes are full.

years.
Startled gasps. More than a few guilty faces.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
And if you’ll forgive me, I’m just
gonna rewrite you one last time.
Love isn’t patient and kind and
humble. Love is messy and horrible
and selfish and...
She can feel Aster’s confused gaze.
Bold.

ELLIE (CONT’D)

A flicker of recognition on Aster’s face.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
It’s not finding your perfect half.
It’s the trying and reaching and
failing - the effort you put in
with no promise of success. Love
is... being willing to ruin your
good painting for a chance at a
great one.
Ellie looks directly at Aster.
ELLIE (CONT’D)
Is this really the boldest stroke
you can make?
Silence.
You.
Yeah.

ASTER
ELLIE

Every breath is held as Aster walks slowly toward ELLIE. She
stops in front of PAUL. Eyes still on Ellie - she SLAPS Paul.
As Aster leaves, the congregation breaks into MAYHEM.
