THE BEGUILED

Written by
Sofia Coppola

Based on the novel by
Thomas Cullinan

FADE IN:
EXT. WOODS - DAY
A wild landscape in the morning light.
We hear cannons in the distance.
TITLE:

“1864, VIRGINIA.

3 YEARS INTO THE CIVIL WAR”

The small figure of a young blonde girl comes into frame.
MAIN TITLES begin in red script over the woods as we follow
the girl, AMY, 12, carrying a basket.
We follow her as she dips in and out of the light in the
shady grove, picking mushrooms as she finds small pockets of
them. She wears braids and a faded prim cotton dress of the
era and sings a song to herself.
The SOUND OF BATTLE increases in the near distance. SMOKE
drifts over a shady glade, surrounded by trees and high
bushes.
Close on Amy’s freckled face; she shudders at the SOUND of a
loud CANNON, and bravely continues, adding mushrooms to her
basket.
She stops at a little shady patch of mushrooms, and as she
picks them, she comes across a SOLDIER’S BOOT.
AMY’S POV:
We follow the boot up legs, and to the body of a man -- a
WOUNDED SOLDIER, in a dirty, blood-stained Union uniform.
Amy carefully leans in to take a closer look at his sootcovered face with a beard.
Suddenly his eyes open -- she jumps back with a scream.
The soldier looks at her.
MCBURNEY
Are you frightened?
No... Yes.

AMY

He looks at the young girl.

2.

So am I.

MCBURNEY

Amy moves in closer.
AMY
Can you move at all?
He struggles to lean up a little on one arm.
MCBURNEY
I’ll try, if there’s some place
to go.
AMY
The Farnsworth school is just on
the other side of the woods.
The Miss Martha Farnsworth
Seminary for Young Ladies.
He thinks about this.
MCBURNEY
Any men about?
AMY
No men, just four other
students, a teacher, and Miss
Farnsworth. The slaves left. I
can’t say you’ll be welcome as a
Yankee, but it will be better
than here.
MCBURNEY
True enough. I’ll accept your
invitation, can you help me up?
Amy struggles to help him up.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
Can you hold on just a bit,
while I get my breath?
AMY
Oh, yes, sir.
She uses all her strength to support his weight.
AMY (CONT’D)
You’re a lot heavier than my
brother.

(CONTINUED)

3.

MCBURNEY
Where’s he now?
AMY
He got killed in Tennessee.
MCBURNEY
That wasn’t none of us, I was
never in Tennessee.
Now upright, he smiles at her in gratitude.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
What’s your name?
AMY
Amelia Dabney.
MCBURNEY
Mine’s McBurney... Corporal John
McBurney.
AMY
Pleased to make your
acquaintance Corporal.
They start off slowly.
The leg of his torn uniform is covered in blood.

(CONTINUED)

4.

MCBURNEY
We’re, off to where was it now?
AMY
Miss Farnsworth’s Seminary for
Young Ladies.
MCBURNEY
With only five students?
AMY
The other girls have gone home,
but Miss Martha kept it open.
It was mainly we didn’t have
anywhere else to go.
They slowly make their way through the brush.
AMY (CONT’D)
My home is Georgia, and my
mother thought it would be
better if I stayed up here in
Virginia for a while... what
with your General Sherman down
there so close to Atlanta and
all...
Smoke rises behind them and cannons BOOM.

AMY (CONT’D)
Did you run away?
WIDE SHOT
We follow them as they slowly make their way into the
distance of the Southern landscape.
MCBURNEY
I’m with the Sixty-Sixth out of
New York...We were hit and I
fell and everything began to
blaze...
AMY
Do you want to go back?
show you the way?

I can

MCBURNEY

leg stops bleedin’.
CUT TO:
EXT. MANSION - DAY
CLOSE ON A WROUGHT IRON SIGN: “THE FARNSWORTH SEMINARY FOR
YOUNG LADIES”
Through the gates, a neglected-looking Southern mansion
stands amongst dry plants and weeds. Nothing else in sight.
Smoke rises in the distance.
Amy and McBurney approach the gates.
CUT TO:
INT. PARLOR - DAY
A class is in session.
In a large living room that has been converted into a
classroom, EDWINA, a tightly-wound, delicate beauty in her
late-twenties, instructs a class of girls.
She stands straight, with her high shirt collar buttoned to
the top and her hair pulled back primly. She looks confined
in her tight, proper clothing.
Edwina speaks in a gentle, well-bred manner and soft voice,
as she makes herself an example of a Southern lady to her
students.
There are four girls listening:
ALICIA, 17, a bored, pretty blonde with long hair stares off.
Her bodice slightly open, she fans herself with a notebook.
CLOSE SHOT
On a fly buzzing in the corner.
Alicia watches it.
JANE, a prim 16-year-old with freckles, sits next to her
carefully following along.
Next to them is EMILY, a practical 15-year-old.

Their faces are pink and dewy in the heat of the room, and
they are all dressed in plain, long dresses of the period,
faded after being washed and mended many times. Some of them
are half-dressed in petticoats.
There is a blackboard propped up with a sentence in French
written on it.
EDWINA
Le Mari de Marie est ici a Paris
aujourd’hui.
The girls repeat after her in unison.

Alicia is pouty as if
CUT TO:

EXT. KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY
The SOUND of a BELL ringing breaks the silence of the hot
day.
In the bright sun, a woman with a large sun hat turns to
reveal: MISS MARTHA FARNSWORTH, 40’s, a pale, worn, Southern
beauty.
With elegant posture, she looks like a lady, not accustomed to
work outside in the kitchen garden. She turns to MARIE, a darkhaired 12-year-old who is helping beside her.
The BELL RINGS AGAIN, and Miss Martha lifts her skirt hems
and rushes to the gate, followed by Marie.
MISS MARTHA
Can’t be the patrol, they were
just here.
CUT TO:
EXT. MANSION - DAY
WIDE SHOT
Miss Martha and Marie rush to the front gate.
A VOICE calls out from a window above.
EMILY (O.S.)
Amy and somebody’s there!
The BELL clangs again.

(CONTINUED)

7.

Help!

AMY
Miss Martha!

Miss Farnsworth swiftly moves to Amy who is halfway up the
walk to the large house. McBurney lies on the ground in
front of her.
The other girls rush out to them.
Miss Martha’s hat has fallen behind her, her hair is swept up
off her face.
Jane leans in to get a better look at the stranger.
Is he dead?

JANE

Miss Martha checks his pulse.
Not yet.

MISS MARTHA

She turns to Amy.
MISS MARTHA (CONT'D)
(sternly)
How’d he get here?
AMY
The woods were burning, I
couldn’t leave him there to die.
The girls all gather around him.
MARTHA
You know you’re not supposed to
go that far!
She looks at McBurney laying on the ground.
MISS MARTHA
We’ll get him to the porch for
now. You can all help, Edwina
take his legs...
EDWINA
Yes, Miss Martha.
The girls surround McBurney.

(CONTINUED)

8.

McBurney opens his eyes, and looks up at:
THE BACK-LIT GROUP OF CURIOUS, FLUSHED-FACED GIRLS, looking
down on him. Their hair ranging from sandy blonde to
chestnut brown.
With a weak smile -- is he dreaming? -- he turns his head a
little to see:
Miss Martha glaring down at him severely.
MCBURNEY
Sixty-Sixth New York, ma’am, and
your grateful prisoner.
JANE
A real blue belly!
WIDER on the group as they lift his dead weight.
Standing tall and efficient, Miss Martha helps the younger
girls where his body is dropping. They start to make their
way toward the porch.
JANE (CONT’D)
(whispers)
You know they rape every
Southern woman they come
across...
MISS MARTHA
Stop that nonsense, Jane!
MARIE
(in awe, staring down
at him)
You wouldn’t know from his face
that he was a Yankee, would you?
MISS MARTHA
Run ahead, Amy, and open the
door for us. And then you come
right back here and tie that
blue rag on the gate...
ALICIA
(maliciously, she bends
down to inform
McBurney)
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

9.
ALICIA (CONT'D)
The blue rag’s so the patrol
will know we’ve captured a live
Yankee...
McBurney’s eyes open briefly, he looks with pain and fear.
Alicia looks down at him through her hair, with a haughty
look.
EXT. MANSION PORCH - DAY
The group reaches the porch. We SEE the beautiful facade of
the house with the great columns rising behind them. They
struggle to get McBurney up the steps.
Miss Martha nods. She braces her back against a column as
they set him down.
EMILY
Is he breathing?
MISS MARTHA
Why didn’t you call out before,
Emily? You must have seen them
crossing the fields!
EMILY
I’m sorry Miss Martha. I forgot
it was my turn to look out.
MISS MARTHA
Someday you’ll forget and it’ll
be Union scroungers in our
garden! That’s how we lost most
of our chickens.
The girls cluster around him, fascinated.
MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
Marie, you get up and look if
you can see any of our soldiers.
Marie reluctantly leaves them.

(CONTINUED)

10.

EDWINA
We ought to wash his wound.
MISS MARTHA
And sew it up. Amy -- didn’t I
tell you to go tie that blue rag
on the gate for the patrol?
Amy reluctantly starts to go.
AMY
Couldn’t we wait a bit?
EDWINA
After all the blood he’s lost,
he’d die if he went now.
The girls look at Miss Martha.
AMY
Wouldn’t it be the Christian
thing to do?
She looks at him.
MISS MARTHA
Yes, and you’re quite right,
Edwina, he’d never make it.
We’ll wait until he’s in shape
to be taken away. Emily, put
some water on to boil. Jane,
Alicia, find any cloth we can
spare and bring it to the music
room.
Miss Martha and the others use all their strength to bring
him inside.
The door of the mansion closes behind them.
We hear the roar of BATTLE in the distance.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
Soft light comes in through the sheer curtains.
A shrouded harp and harpsichord stand in the corner of the
music room with a few music stands and gold chairs.

Family portraits hang on the walls from another time, when
concerts were held. There are faded linens and other
remnants from the mansion’s former glory.
CLOSE SHOT
Miss Martha’s steady hands with shears as she cuts the fabric
of the pants of McBurney’s uniform.
CLOSE SHOT
Torn pants fall on the floor.
CLOSE ON MISS MARTHA
She sees his nakedness -- then looks away, composing herself
to her ladylike ways. She covers him with a piece of linen.
McBurney lies on a pale day bed, unconscious and pale under
his thick beard. Beads of sweat form on his forehead.
His hands are bandaged and he is naked, other than a cloth
across his lap.
Edwina carefully puts a soft pillow under his head.
MISS MARTHA
I need more cloth please,
Edwina. Anything you can find.
EDWINA
Yes, Miss Martha.
Miss Martha is leaning forward, stitching his wound.
A strand of her pinned-back hair has fallen forward in her
work; she pushes it back, in concentration. Her brow
perspires.
Edwina moves a pot of water, as she goes for the cloth.
McBurney’s belt is draped over a chair.
MISS MARTHA
There’s enough metal in there to
shoe a horse... I think I got
most of it.
Edwina with flushed cheeks, looks down on McBurney’s handsome
face.

Edwina’s hands wipe the cloth over McBurney’s forehead.
A slight moan from McBurney, still unconscious.
CLOSE on her hands and cloth wiping soot off of his face.
Water drips down his face, on to his scruffy beard, down his
smooth chest.
She carefully wipes his chest.
Miss Martha finishes up her work.
Edwina, on the verge of fainting, steadies herself with the
back of a chair.
MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
Edwina, please get more water
and I’ll bathe him. I’m going
to get him a clean nightshirt.
EDWINA (SOFTLY)
Yes, Miss Martha.
Edwina follows Miss Martha to the door.
Edwina glances back at McBurney.
Miss Martha opens the door wide -- swiftly.
In the doorway, the school girls all crowding around trying
to get a glimpse of the man, scatter backwards, caught.
MISS MARTHA
I thought so!

Is he going to die?
Miss Martha and Edwina come through the door.

AMY
Then what’ll happen?
MISS MARTHA
We’ll turn him over to the
patrol, of course. If by some
miracle he lives through the
night, which I doubt. In the
meantime I don’t want anyone
poking in here or lurking in the
hall...
AMY
His name, in case you’ve
wondered, is Corporal John
McBurney.
MISS MARTHA
I’m afraid he won’t be here long
enough - dead or alive - for his
name to make any difference to
us.
She turns to Edwina.
MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
There’s too much distraction for
any more studying today.
EDWINA
We have a lot of mending to do.
MISS MARTHA
Good! To the sewing room, all
of you!
She claps her hands to shoo them away.

cloth.

EDWINA (O.S.)
Careful, keep your stitches in a
straight row.
In an old salon, the girls sit around a table with Edwina.
Everything in the room feels faded.
The table has small pieces of cloth, bits of old curtains,
tablecloths, and sewing supplies. They chat as they sew.
AMY
Jane, it’s the same for you as
all of us, you don’t leave
because there’s nowhere for you
to go...
JANE
There is so! My father is with
General Lee and if I so desired,
soldiers would come escort me to
him now.
ALICIA
If anybody knew where that was.
EMILY
My mother wrote me from
Charleston that the blockade is
fearful. She says I probably
eat better here than I would at
home.
You do.

EDWINA

ALICIA
You should have never brought
that Yankee here, Amy.
JANE
I agree. He’s probably a spy
and will let the blue bellies in
at night to raid our garden.
EDWINA
I doubt that, Jane.
EMILY
Miss Edwina, aren’t you afraid
of that blue belly?

(CONTINUED)

15.

EDWINA
No. And it is very bad manners
to call him a blue belly. He
has a name, Corporal John
McBurney.
AMY
(dreamily)
Johnny...
The girls giggle.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
McBurney is passed out, as Miss Martha sits next to him with
a bucket of water and pieces of cloth.
Having volunteered before as a nurse, she keeps a
professional posture, but it is clear that she hasn’t seen a
man’s body in a long time.
She pushes her hair back as she dips a cloth into the warm
water and cleans his arms carefully. Sunlight outlines his
body as she cleans his shoulders and chest. Then his legs.
Miss Martha takes a deep breath, and lifts the cloth covering
him, as she moves the cloth to his hips and inner thighs...

It’s our boys, Miss Martha.
They’ll be passing our way.
Alicia’s bosom is pushed up in her tight bodice.
ALICIA
Can’t we go and greet them?
MISS MARTHA
Confederate soldiers? Alone?
JANE
I think, maybe they have some
prisoners.
MISS MARTHA
I don’t want them to see you
girls. Go upstairs!
They run upstairs.
Miss Martha goes to the mirror in the foyer on her way out.
She buttons her collar high and smooths her skirt.

CLOSE on Amy, perched at the window; she looks down on the
scene.

You think Miss Martha’s going to
tell them about him?
Alicia, Jane, and Marie pass a row of single beds with faded
blankets and quilts and lean in around Amy, trying to see.
THEIR POV:
EXT. MANSION GATES - LATE AFTERNOON
The Captain, now standing, talks to Miss Martha at the gate.
She stands composed, like a lady, with a subtle tilt of her
head, as if she was at the entrance of a ball.

You all alone, ma’am?
MISS MARTHA
Just a teacher and a few
students.

Well, take care. Ma’am. Lot of

MISS MARTHA
Yes, Captain. I wonder if you
might have a few cartridges you
could spare.
CAPTAIN
What good would that do you,
ma’am?
MISS MARTHA
My father left his revolver, and
I’d feel much safer knowing I
might use it if needed.
He nods in respect.

In the low light, Edwina pauses to look through a space in
the slightly open door.
She sees Amy inside kneeling at the beside of a sleeping

Does anyone wish to ask for
special blessings?

In the dark room, Alicia sneaks up close to his face.
She touches his beard, and moves in close to him, getting a
good look at him.
She leans in and lightly kisses his lips, then kisses him
longer this time. With his eyes still closed, he seems to
kiss her back.
McBurney’s eyes open for a second, looking lost, as if in a
dream.
Alicia looks at him, still breathing softly.
ALICIA

Good night, Corporal.
Alicia sneaks off before she’s caught.
McBurney watches her go.

Alicia gives her an innocent smile like -- what?!
She slips
back into her chair and bows her head with the others. She
has a tiny secret smile on her lips.
Edwina returns her head down in prayer.

You don’t mince words, ma’am.
You speak right up, I like that.

Do you indeed? And do you think
it makes a great difference to
me whether you like it or not?
He looks at her, enjoying the rally.
MCBURNEY
I’m sure my opinion means
nothing at all to you, ma’am...
I’m not looking for your praise.

most appreciative.

MISS MARTHA
Aren’t you afraid I’ll turn you
over to our soldiers?
MCBURNEY
No, I don’t think so. I don’t
say you won’t do it, but very
likely worse things could happen
to me. I don’t relish the
prospect of prison, but it’s
better than being dead. And
that’s what I would be if you
hadn’t helped me.
There is something lovable about him.

Not necessarily. Is your leg
paining you?
Yes, some.

MCBURNEY

MISS MARTHA
Well, I hear that numbness would
be more grave. There’s brandy
if you wish.
MCBURNEY
That would be a pleasure.
MISS MARTHA
It isn’t being offered for your
pleasure, only for your comfort.
Yes, ma’am.

MCBURNEY

Miss Martha sits up straight.
MISS MARTHA
I must remind you Corporal
McBurney, that you are not our
guest, but a most unwelcome
visitor. We don’t propose to
entertain you here.

MCBURNEY
I wouldn’t expect it ma’am....

amused.
McBurney looks to see Alicia in the doorway -- with a fake
innocent look on her face. She looks up through blond
strands of hair.
Miss Martha turns.
MISS MARTHA
What is it, Miss?
ALICIA
I just wondered if there’s
anything I can do to help?
McBurney looks at Alicia.
Martha notices, protectively.
McBurney lies back.
Miss Martha goes back to addressing Alicia.
MISS MARTHA
There is nothing you can do
here. You have enough studies
and other work to keep you well
occupied.
ALICIA
I only thought to help.
MISS MARTHA
That won’t be necessary. And
Miss Alicia, you can tell the
others this room is off limits.
Yes, ma’am.

ALICIA

Alicia gives an insolent little curtsey, with a
conspiratorial look to McBurney, she leaves.
MCBURNEY
You can trust me in your place,
ma’am.

MISS MARTHA
I don’t know you.
MCBURNEY
If you got to know me, I think
you would.
MISS MARTHA
You won’t be here that long.
Miss Martha nods and picks up her skirts and makes her way
out.
Ma’am?

MCBURNEY

MISS MARTHA
Yes Corporal?
MCBURNEY
I’d like a bit of soap and a
razor if you have.
MISS MARTHA
I’ll see what I can find.
MCBURNEY
Thank you, ma’am.
He smiles at her happily, like a schoolboy.
Miss Martha leaves.
McBurney lies back on his bed, marveling at his fortune to
find himself in such a prison.

about what business a twelve-year-old would have here with
him.

Marie speaks in a low voice, keeping her conversation with

I wanted to bring this to you

might die before morning, but
then I thought since you were
unconscious, you wouldn’t be
able to read it anyway.
MCBURNEY
That’s very logical.

Are you Protestant?
MCBURNEY
I was baptized Catholic.

Well then, here’s a prayer book

She opens a white handkerchief and places a small bar of
lavender soap, a razor, and a tortoiseshell comb on a table
next to McBurney with a pitcher of water on it.
She freezes up, not knowing what to say.
MCBURNEY
Thank you very much.
He reclines, trying to clean his black fingernails.
EDWINA
They look as if you had been
trying to dig a pit with them.
MCBURNEY
I was. In the battle, with all
that iron flying overhead, my
first thought was to bury
myself.
EDWINA
And when you couldn’t, you ran?
I did.

MCBURNEY
I surely to God did.

Edwina looks at him, his eyes smiling.
EDWINA
It wasn’t very brave of you to

She makes herself busy with some task, straightening up the

Edwina looks at him.
McBurney smiles up at her warmly, his eyes sparkling.
She moves again.
MCBURNEY
Then you do care what I think

EDWINA
You’re a stranger here, that’s

Because something tells me we’re

GIRLS (IN UNISON)

Miss Martha looks at them pleasantly as they start their
meal.
MISS MARTHA
It has occurred to me that we
might all reflect on the
unexpected presence of Corporal
McBurney in this house -- until
his leg heals, of course. And we
might discuss how we may
practice compassion and what
else we may learn from this.
What does each of you think of
this?
Miss Martha looks around the table at the girls.
MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
Miss Alicia, can you tell us how
we may learn from his presence
here?
They all look to Alicia.
ALICIA
Well, maybe the sight of him
will remind us there is
something else in the world
besides lessons.
MISS MARTHA
It seems to me that is all there
should be for any young lady
your age. If we learn our
lessons properly when young, we
can expect a calm and happy life
when we are faced with the
distractions of the world. N’estce-pas?

Edwina nods.

make.

fresh air from the outside
world, I think is welcome to us
all.
EMILY
I heard he said he was a
mercenary, so maybe he’s not
even really the enemy.
AMY
What’s a mercenary?
ALICIA
It means he’s just paid by the
army to fight, he’s not really
fighting their cause.
MISS MARTHA
Well, we don’t know about that.
AMY
He seems to be a student of
nature, so I expect to learn
about foreign wildlife.
EDWINA
He seems to be a sensitive
person.

propped up on pillows on the settee.

Since our music lessons were
suspended today in order to
permit the Corporal to rest, why
don’t we have a little music now
-- if Corporal McBurney will not
be too disturbed by a little
divertisement?

Not at all, ma’am, I’m very fond
of music.

Jane.

I’m sure you can.

Possibly not. It could be some

LOUD KNOCKS hit the door below again.

MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
If it is Yankees or unruly
soldiers of our own army, I will
rap three times on this door.
Then you will take the girls out
to the woods behind the garden
and stay there until I come for
you.

What about Corporal McBurney?

But he couldn’t ride without
hurting his leg.

I could tell them about him and
suggest since he’s wounded that
they come back for him, but that
could be weeks or months.

taking him right now, and who
knows what’ll happen to him.

You keep talking about him as if
he were some old piece of

And there are the doubts if we
can really consider him an
enemy.
They all look at Miss Martha.

McBurney waits for his fate.

I will allow Corporal McBurney
to remain until his leg heals.
If one of you is opposed, I will
tell the soldiers and let them
decide what to do with him.

No hands are raised.
Well, then.

I want to give them what they’ll
need to survive in these times.
It will be such a different
world they’ll be going out into,
I don’t think they realize.
MCBURNEY
They can’t know what it’s like
out there.
MISS MARTHA
Sometimes I get so tired... I
pray the end is near. It’s hard
to find any sense in it, how
much everyone has suffered.

Did you have someone before the
war?
I did.
I’m sorry.

offer but it has been neglected
for some time, and it can remain
that way a while longer.
AMY
Have you had much gardening
experience, Corporal McBurney?
MCBURNEY
Oh yes, I did a good bit of it.

Well, if you really have a knack
for gardening, you can make

It twinges a bit now and then.

I would expect that. You may
recall I was opposed to you
walking on it so soon, however I
can appreciate your need to be
active. May I check?
Yes, ma’am.

MCBURNEY

He sits on a bench, as Miss Martha checks the wound under his
bandages.
MISS MARTHA
The stitches seem to be holding
and the wound is healing nicely.
MCBURNEY
When do you think I’ll be
recovered?
MISS MARTHA
Some may say you’re recovered
now. I’m sure the army surgeons
would say you’re ready to return
to duty.
MCBURNEY
So, you’d like me to leave?
MISS MARTHA
I didn’t say that.
MCBURNEY
Surely not, you’re too polite a
lady to be so blunt about it.

I am as blunt as I need to be,
Corporal McBurney. Since you
brought it up, I will tell you
that I think your leg is healed
enough to leave by the end of
this week.
MCBURNEY
That’s in just a few days.
Yes, it is.

MISS MARTHA

MCBURNEY
Where would I go?
MISS MARTHA
I’m afraid that is entirely your
business where you go, Corporal.
However I should think you might
find columns of your troops on
the main road to Richmond.
He looks out.
MCBURNEY
Your garden should have
continual care, you need a fulltime gardener.

Perhaps, but I expect we’ll have
to do without in these times.

ALICIA
We will have to make things so
pleasant for him that he won’t
even consider leaving us, until
we decide of course, that it’s
time for him to go.
EMILY
We might suggest to Miss Martha
that it would be nice if
Corporal McBurney could join us
at the table for dinner.
AMY
Yes, he must get lonely eating
alone in his room.

We should show him some real
Southern hospitality.

You have no idea how lovely you
are.
Edwina’s stiff manner crumbles.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
Miss Farnsworth suggested it’s
time for me to be on my way.
EDWINA
I don’t want you to leave.
MCBURNEY
I don’t want to leave you,
Edwina. I love you.
EDWINA
Please... don’t ever say that to
me unless you mean it.
MCBURNEY
I do. I knew exactly how I felt
about you from that first day I
talked to you, but was afraid to
say anything for fear you’d
never let me near you again.
I’m only telling you now because
this may be my only chance. I
realize I’m not good enough for
you, Edwina.
EDWINA
That’s not true.

The evening is festive, with chatter and the passing of bowls

biscuits. They are all enjoying having a man at the table,
but Jane is still suspicious of the Northern enemy.
A radiant Edwina wears a blue silk dress, that sits off her
shoulders.
MISS MARTHA
That dress is very becoming on
you, Miss Edwina.
Thank you.

EDWINA

ALICIA
There might be other attractive
shoulders here if we were all
permitted to wear such dresses.
MISS MARTHA
It is not entirely suitable
dress for a young ladies school,
but we know that Miss Edwina is
accustomed to town society with
different views. I suggest we
change the subject and that Miss
Edwina might consider drawing
her shawl to prevent any other
speculation on the subject.
Edwina demurely pulls her shawl over her shoulders as Alicia
watches.
McBurney gives Edwina a little smile from across the table.
She smiles back at him.
MCBURNEY
This is the finest meal I can
remember.
MISS MARTHA
Merci Beaucoup...Miss Alicia

Alicia passes by and gives Edwina a snotty look like -- I’m

Edwina looks to McBurney.
He leans in, whispers to her under the music, she smiles and
they exchange whispered plans.
Miss Martha appears.
McBurney straightens himself and bows to Miss Martha.
MISS MARTHA
May I offer you a digestif, some
brandy, Corporal?
Yes, ma’am.

MCBURNEY

He nods to Edwina and sits down with Miss Martha, happy to
partake.
MISS MARTHA
My father had quite a cellar in
his day. The house was full of
parties... People traveled from

MCBURNEY
I’ll bet it was splendid here,
ma’am.
MISS MARTHA
It was. There were elegant
dinners and balls... carriages

She’s flattered.
MISS MARTHA
Oh, all bravery is -- is doing

Tell me, Corporal, do you think
this war will be over soon?
MCBURNEY
Very soon, sooner than you
Southerners are ready to admit.
I know...

MISS MARTHA

MCBURNEY
And you could use some help
around here. A man’s help.
He sips the brandy slowly and looks into her eyes.
Miss Martha tilts her head in reflection.
She looks up as the music ends, and sets down her glass.
MISS MARTHA
Please gather for our evening

Miss Martha starts the prayers, as the others gather around

Yes, Miss Amy. Corporal
McBurney’s stay with us has

A dark shadow comes into frame and falls over her, with the
sound of a footstep.
Amy turns to see McBurney.
MCBURNEY
What are you doing there, Miss
Amy?
She looks at him a beat and takes off running. He tries to
grab her, but she gets away.
McBurney follows after her as fast as he can go.

Miss Martha opens the door slowly, letting in a stream of
light in the dark shed.
We stay CLOSE with Miss Martha as she carefully looks around,
her back against the wall.

MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
Won’t you come inside with me?
We have one more bottle of

He lets Amy go.

The girls scramble from the window and sit, terrified.
Miss Martha enters with Amy, followed by McBurney.
Miss Martha stands erect, between McBurney and the girls,
trying to guard them in some way.
McBurney looks at her from the doorway, fed up.
MCBURNEY
The next one of you to try
something is going to be sorry.
Miss Martha keeps her voice down and controlled.
MISS MARTHA
Miss Marie, please go to the
cellar and fetch that last
bottle of bourbon.
She slips her a key, and Marie moves past, avoiding McBurney
in the doorway.

MCBURNEY
Amy, I thought we were
friends... I never meant any
harm to any of you. Look at me,
look what you’ve done to me. I’d
rather be dead than a man
without a leg, hobbling around.
I see how you look at me... your
disgust and pity.
He starts to cry.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
I’m not a man, I took your
kindness and trusted you and you
toyed with me and then butchered
me.
The girls stare.
He looks up at them with a fierce look in his eye.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
I’ve had enough with your
devilment. I’ve got four shots
left, and the next one of you to
try something is going to get it
from me.
The girls sit in terror. He raises his voice.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
Do you hear me?!
McBurney pulls the trigger and shoots the chandelier. It
comes crashing down.
The girls scream, Jane cries.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
The next shot is for one of you.
He staggers out.
The girls stare, frozen in place.

Edwina pushes past her.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Miss Martha tries to block Edwina.
MISS MARTHA
Don’t make a fool of yourself.
Edwina looks at her stone-faced and fed-up.
EDWINA
Get out of my way.
MISS MARTHA
No, Edwina, don’t.
She shoves Miss Martha out of her way roughly and moves past
her, determined.
Miss Martha falls against the wall in distress.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
McBurney lies on his bed. He looks over as his door starts
to open slowly -- what is it now?
Edwina stands in the doorway.
McBurney watches as Edwina enters, closing the door carefully
behind her.
MCBURNEY
What do you want?
McBurney watches as Edwina uses all her strength to push a
sofa across the door as a barricade.
She stares at him as she walks over.
He watches her approach.
Edwina leans down to him, bracing her arms on his, and kisses
him -- with all her pent-up passion.

He grabs her and pins her down, fed up with her -- he rips

ALICIA
You’re going to just let her be
alone with him like that?!
MISS MARTHA
Hush, Alicia, we have bigger
problems to solve.
JANE
I knew it was a mistake when you
brought him here, Amy.
MISS MARTHA
Don’t blame her, she did it out
of the goodness of her heart...
Now we must think... Since no
one in this house is safe as
long as he remains here. It’s
just a matter of how we can rid
ourselves of him.
EMILY
Can’t we leave him back in the
woods?
MISS MARTHA
We can’t take the risk that
he’ll meet and bring his troops.
EMILY
We could hang him?!
Miss Martha looks at her.
MISS MARTHA
Let’s not resort to brutality...

(CONTINUED)

88.

JANE
We can’t go on like this with
him here.
MISS MARTHA
We shall have to do something,
and quickly, about him. I’m
very worried of what might
happen next.
AMY
I can tell him he’s no longer
welcome around certain people,
if you like.
MISS MARTHA
You’ll do nothing of the sort,
Miss.
ALICIA
You’re an idiot if you think
he’s going to take suggestions
from you, Amy.
AMY
I was trying to help.
MISS MARTHA
Girls, please.
JANE
Will you go and get help?
MISS MARTHA
I don’t want to leave you here
alone with him...
MARIE
He loved the mushrooms.
MISS MARTHA
What was that?
MARIE
The corporal sure did love the
mushrooms we served him. What if
Amy picked the kind -- some
especially for him?
Miss Martha looks at her, getting her drift.

(CONTINUED)

89.

I see.

MISS MARTHA

A beat.
MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
Do you think you could do that,
Amy? Find some mushrooms for
the corporal?
Amy looks at her.
MISS MARTHA (CONT'D)
You’ll have to be very careful
that he doesn’t notice you
leaving the house.
Miss Martha grasps Amy’s wrists in emphasis.

Amy looks her

AMY
Yes, Miss Martha.
Miss Martha addresses the group.
MISS MARTHA
We’ll make him a nice supper, we

We’ll get out that smoked ham

bowl of your mushrooms sauteed
in butter and wine...

Miss Martha and the rest of the household sit around the
table, dressed up in their finery. Miss Martha wears taffeta
and earrings, the girls in their holiday dresses.
Miss Martha and the girls look up as McBurney comes in
followed by Edwina. He is wearing his washed and mended
uniform.
McBurney smiles at the warm hospitality. Edwina, at his
side, has her hair down and wears a pretty dress. With her
flushed cheeks, for the first time she looks unwound.

She smiles at McBurney as they look at each other like -Isn’t this nice?

MISS MARTHA
Corporal, we’d like to let you
know that we harbor no ill
feelings, and made this meal in
commemoration of your journey
ahead.
MCBURNEY
Thank you for excusing my
outburst.
MISS MARTHA
Think nothing of it.
MCBURNEY
And thank you for this-- This
looks like just about the finest
meal I’ve ever seen.
Edwina is pleased that harmony is restored.
Jane looks across at Emily.
Platters are passed around with the ham, corn bread, greens.
MISS MARTHA
Bon Appetit. Oh, wait-- wait.
We haven’t said grace.
They put the platters down.
Everyone lowers their heads.
MISS MARTHA (CONT’D)
The Lord is gracious and full of
compassion; slow to anger, and
of great mercy. Bless us and
these thy gifts which we receive
from thy bountiful goodness,

Amen.

Amen.

some? Corporal?
MCBURNEY
Yes, ma’am, I’m fond of them.
Edwina looks at him with love.
Close on the bowl of mushrooms being passed over to him
silently, from girl to girl, no one taking any.
The bowl is handed to McBurney.
All eyes are on him.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
What about you, Miss Morrow?
Jane and Emily look to Edwina who is oblivious and lost in
romantic thoughts.
She speaks with a gentle smile.
Thank you.

EDWINA

He starts to serve her some.
The girls look at each other.

But, Miss Edwina, you don’t like

Mmmm... Miss Amy, you picked
these yourself?
Amy nods.
CLOSE on Amy’s hand under the table as she squeezes the girl
next to her.
They all watch as McBurney eats up the mushrooms, washing
them down with wine.
He smiles, his mouth full of food.
MCBURNEY (CONT’D)
I don’t plan to stay here much
longer, but while I am here,
I’ll try to make it up to you
for all the unfortunate things
that happened.
Miss Martha smiles graciously at him.
He takes another big forkful of mushrooms and swallows them
down with more wine.
The girls watch him.
McBurney with perspiration on his forehead, tries to unloosen
his collar. He starts to choke, realizing something is wrong.
He looks up.
The united women calmly watch.
Edwina grasps him, in confused desperation.
John?

John?
