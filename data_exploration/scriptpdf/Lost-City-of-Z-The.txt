THE LOST CITY OF Z

GRAY AND WHITE.
Our opening image is uneven lines of gray and white,
beautiful and abstract.
We HEAR WIND.
The CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL:
1

EXT. IRISH LANDSCAPE - LATE DAY

1

A desolate-seeming, visually magnificent landscape. We were
looking at clouds, and they form glorious patterns in the
lowered sky. Like a painting by Lorraine, or Corot, or
Turner.
The horizon is dark, almost charcoal black.
A thin layer of fog drifts slowly across that abstract
surface.
As the FOG MOVES, it reveals: a MAN.
He has been running towards us. A silhouette. Like the rest
of the opening image, his appearance to us should conjure the
PRIMAL, the MYTHIC, the ELEMENTAL. It is as though he were
born out of this fog, this cosmic force.
He emerges from the fog.
It is PERCY HARRISON FAWCETT.
Thirties and handsome. Not exactly a youngster, but not
creaky and old, either. Strikes us as cheerful. A gentle
voice, an even manner. Despite his cheer and charm, however,
there is something steely about him, resolved, committed.
His eyes reveal a far more complex person than the exterior
might first allow; behind their twinkle there lurks a
capacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution, the
more dangerous because they are held in leash...
Over the wind now, we begin to HEAR CHURCH BELLS RINGING.
Fawcett himself gets closer and closer to us... We HEAR a
WOMAN’S VOICE, distant:
Percy!

WOMAN’S VOICE
Percy!

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a SILHOUETTE in the
foreground, through a doorway. A WOMAN’S FORM.

EXT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

2

Outside a rural church. A woman steps toward the outer
fence, holding a small baby. She is waiting for Percy, it
seems. The WOMAN is NINA FAWCETT. The baby is JACK FAWCETT,
their newborn son.
Nina Fawcett, thirties, is bubbly and flighty, but also
highly cultured. Brash at times, a woman of independent
curiosity.
There are a few other people, of varying ages and shapes and
sizes, right behind her. All look happy, very happy. Among
them: JAMES BERNARD, 4th EARL OF BANDON (”LORD BERNARD”),
seventies, piercing eyes, intense.
Percy ARRIVES AT LAST. He meets her and the child. He
embraces her, and the couple look ecstatic, glowing.
NINA FAWCETT
We’d no doubt you’d be here-(to the baby)
DID we, Jack.
PERCY FAWCETT
The men made a complete hash of
drill and I had to set them to
rights.
(looks at the other
people)
Good afternoon all... We’re very
grateful for your attendance today.
(back to Nina)
Shall we, darling?

INT. CHURCH - LATER
It is a rural Irish church, lovely, with history.
toward the end of a CHRISTENING CEREMONY.

We are

SUPERIMPOSE: “CORK, IRELAND, 1903”
A MINISTER is here, putting the christening robe on the boy.
He anoints him with oil, and as he does he speaks. While he
speaks, we have a CLOSE SHOT on the INFANT’S HAND. Percy’s
hand caresses it. Then a CLOSE SHOT on PERCY--a smile, then
a kind of regression into thought. HE GETS EMOTIONAL...

Lost City of Z

MINISTER
May God, who has received you by
baptism into his Church, pour upon
you the riches of his grace...
WHILE HE IS FINISHING HIS SPEECH: NINA WITHDRAWS AN ELABORATE
MANDALA NECKLACE, which she HANGS AROUND the CHILD’S HEAD.
The others nearby who see this are flummoxed for a moment.
Except for Percy, who touches the mandala with a surprising
reverence...
Those IN ATTENDANCE finish things with an “AMEN”. The
Minister then turns to Percy and Nina and the others:
MINISTER (CONT’D)
As this is a private ceremony, I
shall take the liberty to welcome
Jack’s parents back from Ceylon,
where they have been stationed for
three years. I know Major Percy
Fawcett and his lovely wife, Nina
to be fine people, who, though they
have often pursued their own path,
remain committed to making their
family a true support of our
Christian community.
A “HERE HERE” from those in attendance. All converge on
Percy and Nina and baby Jack. James Bernard, 4th Earl of
Bandon (”LORD BERNARD”) approaches Nina and Percy:
LORD BERNARD
What a beautiful ceremony. Such a
precious child--congratulations to
you both. And no doubt, great
comfort after such a difficult
birth.
NINA FAWCETT
Thank you, Lord Bernard. It WAS a
very near thing, and there was much
concern. But all is well now.
LORD BERNARD
Of course, of course!
(turns to Percy)
A word to the wise--been very
difficult for many of the men at
the Fort to find a nanny of good
character.

PERCY FAWCETT
We intend to raise the boy
ourselves, Lord Bernard--we don’t
wish for our children to be
strangers.
(to Nina)
Our children will become our
dearest companions.
LORD BERNARD
(as though they were
insane)
Ah... I see...very well, then...
I...wish you the very best...
Fawcett nods to Bernard, then, beaming, turns back to his
wife. With great expectation and tenderness, to his wife:
PERCY FAWCETT
Our lives begin anew today...
We begin to HEAR: a GALLOPING HORSE: THUMPITY THUMPITY
THUMPITY... LOUDER AND LOUDER...
CUT TO:

EXT. CORK HARBOR, IRELAND - LATE DAY

4

A Fort: large and foreboding.
SILHOUETTED, the sun behind: MOUNTED SOLDIERS ON HORSES,
galloping in circles. PERCY FAWCETT is dressed impeccably
atop his horse; he wears a crisp uniform with gold buttons
and a spiked helmet strapped under his chin.
NEAR A WALL AT THE CHURCH: a GROUP OF OLDER MEN, standing,
and WOMEN, seated, with their children. With umbrellas above
their heads, fans in hand. NINA is here, holding JACK, NOW
AGE 3. IRISH BAGPIPES and DRUMS are playing; children are
dancing. LORD BERNARD is here, standing near NINA.
ANGLE ON: a HUNT LEADER, late forties. He is surrounded by
the mounted soldiers, ready for a big moment. LOUDLY:
HUNT LEADER
Gentlemen! I expect you to behave
with distinction on this hunt! The
deer will be delivered to the
Archduke Ferdinand at the gala!
(MORE)

Lost City of Z

HUNT LEADER (CONT'D)
Remember: honor, duty, and good
sportsmanship are the cornerstones
of our proud civilization! Good
luck and godspeed!
Fawcett sees them in the distance. They wave to him. In
return, he explodes in warmth, waves. OTHER SOLDIERS circle
FAWCETT, ribbing him in their soldierly way:
OTHER SOLDIER #1
Could they not fit your rocking
chair on the horse, granddad?!?
PERCY FAWCETT
You’ll all be my gunbearers by
evening--have no doubt of that!
ANGLE ON NINA
Who sits many feet away.
NINA FAWCETT
(in the boy’s ear)
Wave, to your father...
The child waves, and PERCY, THRILLED, WAVES BACK.
ANOTHER SOLIDER BLOWS a HORN.
Fawcett and the REST OF THE MEN ON HORSEBACK break out with
great determination. Fawcett YELLS at, KICKS, his horse...
5

EXT. CORK HARBOR - FIELDS
A WILD DEER, a buck with big antlers, speeds through the
grass. Hounds BARK, running through the terrain...
The PACK OF HORSES, FAWCETT AMONG THEM, chases behind. We
HEAR the distant WHOOPS, the CHEERS, the HORNS, the
EXULTATION of the MOUNTED TROOPS charging in pursuit of the
deer...
PERCY FAWCETT is on his horse, HOOTING, as are the others.
The Other Soldiers RIDE NEXT TO HIM--COMPETITIVE and SOURFACED that he rides off in a different direction:
Fawcett!
FAWCETT!

OTHER SOLDIER #1
There’s no path there!
You’re mad!

FAWCETT RIDES OFF into another direction--where there is no
path.

5

Lost City of Z

6.

THE HOUNDS run as though their lives depend on it, BARKING
rabidly in pursuit... THE DEER is running because its life
DOES depend on it... The horses are kicked until bloody...
HORSE after HORSE tumbles from rough terrain, and many of the
MEN--UNLIKE FAWCETT--are not able to continue...
FAWCETT kicks/whips his horse with astonishing drive, and
does an end-run around many of his competitors, cutting them
off.
The deer, meanwhile, enters a nearby area of dense, tall
grass. It runs in a circle, entangled by the weeds. FAWCETT
approaches the animal.
Fawcett takes out his RIFLE... HE FIRES. The deer stumbles
to the ground. JUST THEN, YOUNG SOLDIERS ARRIVE AT THE
SCENE, hounds too. Fawcett watches the animal die.
One of the soldiers examines the deer and calls out, “DEAD!”.
A CHEER. The men pass a FLASK to Fawcett, who takes a swig:
PERCY FAWCETT
To death--the best sauce to life!
Some of the men let out another LOUD CHEER as others are
considerably more disappointed...
NEAR THE CHURCH
Fawcett goes to his BABY SON and beaming Nina. He kisses
Nina, then HOLDS THE CHILD HIGH, kisses him. A HUGE GRIN
from the happy father amidst cheers.
Music up: “Avrem Lieta,” from Giuseppe Verdi’s LA TRAVIATA, a
forceful and upbeat waltz:

EXT. FAWCETT RESIDENCE - ARMY BARRACKS - NIGHT
Fawcett approaches his barracks door.
SINGING TROOPS.

We PASS a GROUP of

ARMY SOLDIERS

boys call Cock, cockity ock ock,

SERIES OF SHOTS:
1. MEDIUM SHOT - The Fawcett RESIDENCE.
With THREE FOX TERRIERS MOVING ABOUT.

FILLED WITH CLUTTER.

2. CLOSE SHOT - a STATUE OF THE BUDDHA.
3. CLOSE SHOT - a STACK of LEAFLETS on a DESK: “VOTES FOR
WOMEN!”
4. MEDIUM SHOT - a JOYOUS little JACK, with his stuffed
animal, plays with the dogs.
5. CLOSE SHOT - All the formal wear for Percy Fawcett LAID ON
A BED. A HAND REACHES down, PICKS UP a PIECE OF CLOTHING.
TILT UP to REVEAL: PERCY PUTTING IT ON. He looks STIFF, but
bemused.
6. CLOSE SHOT - A WOMAN, a MAID, is STRUGGLING with
SOMETHING. WIDEN to REVEAL: SHE is HELPING NINA get into a
CORSET. Nina spots Percy, all finished dressing. He STANDS
in the DOORWAY, silhouetted, watching.
(Young ARMY SOLDIERS are outside, chanting:)
NINA FAWCETT
Oh, this damned thing!
(to Percy)
You must be so pleased with
yourselves, you men! Making us
wear these awful things!
She then adjusts her HAIR:
PERCY FAWCETT
If you keep refusing to wear your
hair as the others do, at least
you’ll not appear tonight in
trousers.
The MAID LEAVES.
POCKET WATCH:

His smile deserts him; he looks at his

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
We’re going to be late.
Nina fixes herself for another beat, then:
NINA FAWCETT

Well?

PERCY FAWCETT
Rather lovely.
NINA FAWCETT
“Rather lovely”. Thank you!
look “rather” well yourself!

You

Percy nods. Then says nothing. She eyes him for a moment,
then, turning back to the mirror:
NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
All right, out with it. What’s
amiss?
PERCY FAWCETT
I’ll be the only man there tonight
of my rank whose uniform is
unadorned.
NINA FAWCETT
My God, that again?
PERCY FAWCETT
The great Secretary Bryce will be
in attendance.
(mocking voice; as a joke)
”Oh Major Fawcett, have you no
medals? Oh no, Mr. Bryce--I’ve
been quite busy training ancient
militia men to point their rifles
at tree stumps. So--no medals for
me.”
He sits down near her.
Then she leans back.

She sits on his lap, KISSES him.

NINA FAWCETT
Who’s this Mr. Bryce when he’s at
home?
PERCY FAWCETT
The last man here upon whom we
might possibly rely for
advancement.
I see.
A beat.

NINA FAWCETT

Then:
PERCY FAWCETT
(more serious now)
I’m getting older, Cheeky. And
very impatient of lost years.

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT'D)
I know the tokens are ridiculous.
I do. But I think of our boy--we
cannot close any doors to him.
NINA FAWCETT
(smiles gently)
Then let us be off.

INT. LORD BERNARD’S MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

The MUSIC CONTINUES. The camera BEGINS on a CLOSE SHOT of a
WALTZING COUPLE, then PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
A GALA for FRANZ FERDINAND, Archduke of Austria-Este and heir
presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. An enormous
ballroom in a mansion, with tens of couples dancing in
seeming unison, twirling around and around, almost like
dolls.
CLOSE SHOT: THE DEER. Laid out... THE ARCHDUKE STANDS in a
receiving line with OFFICERS. SHAKES HANDS, SMILING. LORD
BERNARD and BRIGADIER GENERAL SIDNEY VARNON THORNTON,
forties, are here with him.
ACROSS THE ROOM: PERCY AND NINA FAWCETT ENTER, their image
reflected multiple times on a wall of mirrors. Fawcett nods
greetings to his fellow officers; Nina SPEAKS GREETINGS in
GERMAN to an officer from Austria as all women check out the
handsome Percy...
Fawcett and Nina move through the crowd. Many recognize
them; random PARTYGOERS pass by, say hello.
LORD BERNARD
Good evening, Madame Nina...
You’re looking wonderful...
Major... Welcome. So happy to
have you here.
The two acknowledge the hellos.
MOMENTS LATER
Percy and Nina are in the middle of the dance floor.
pose for a moment, about to start a waltz.

They

And then they start dancing to the rhythm of the Verdi.
Fawcett and Nina are fine dancers, blessed with grace but
also training.
ANGLE BACK ON THE CHIEF SECRETARY OF IRELAND, JAMES BRICE,
here at the head of a receiving line. TROOPS ready the deer
to present to the Archduke.

Lost City of Z

10.

SECRETARY BRYCE
Your majesty--I present to you this
fine animal, a gift from our
government to yours, and a
recognition of our shared history
and mutual interests.
The ARCHDUKE BOWS IN GRATITUDE, ACCEPTS THE DEER. Bryce
ushers the Archduke toward an antechamber. As he does, Bryce
turns to Lord Bernard.
SECRETARY BRYCE (CONT’D)
Lord Bernard, we do appreciate the
use of your magnificent home.
LORD BERNARD
Oh, it is my pleasure. We’ve seen
far too little of this type of
cheer these past few seasons.
SECRETARY BRYCE
Yes, a fine showing by the men...
By the way, who got the kill?
LORD BERNARD
(pointing him out)
That would be Major Fawcett, Mr.
Secretary.
SECRETARY BRYCE
Well then, invite him in for a
drink!
Bernard gives a SLIGHT WAVE OF HIS HAND; then:
LORD BERNARD
(moves closer)
A bit odd. And, may I say, not
entirely... fortunate in his choice
of ancestors.
SECRETARY BRYCE
(comprehending somehow)
I see. Right, then...
FAWCETT AND NINA DANCE
Around and around. Fawcett SEES the OFFICERS STARING AT HIM,
and he can TELL they are talking about him--and not in a
flattering way, either. A LAUGH, a SNICKER...
HE IS DISRESPECTED, AND HE KNOWS IT.

Lost City of Z
They are toasting each other.
dance and turn:

11.

Nina sees the line too as they

NINA FAWCETT
They’re toasting the kill without
you.
Fawcett looks, then turns back:
PERCY FAWCETT
Well, I am dancing with you. So
I’ve got the better of the bargain.
An OLDER OFFICER, THOMAS FRANCIS BUSBY, cuts in:
THOMAS FRANCIS BUSBY
May I, Major?
PERCY FAWCETT
I’m afraid I’ve spoken too soon.
As is the custom, Fawcett bows gracefully, nods his assent,
gives his wife to Busby, who is short and pudgy.
Nina and Percy lock eyes; they are not given chance to speak.
Off Busby and Nina go, dancing.
Percy takes out a CIGAR. He LOOKS at Secretary Bryce and
Lord Bernard and Sidney Thornton and the rest of the officers
as they then enter a smaller antechamber. And the DOOR is
CLOSED ON HIM. And US.
We TILT DOWN.

PERCY BREAKS THE CIGAR in TWO.

EXT. FORT - OUTSIDE HORSE STABLES - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE THE LEGEND: “APRIL, 1906”.
Troops load ARTILLERY SHELLS onto CARTS which are dragged by
horses. The shells are heavy; and the troops stand knee-deep
in the muddy water. Fawcett is supervising an OFFICER:
PERCY FAWCETT
Each can contain no more than
twelve shells, Corporal...
OFFICER
(to the grunts)
Come on! Put your backs into it!
The OFFICER CANES A GRUNT. Fawcett cannot hide his distaste.
Turning his back to the troops, in the Officer’s face, he
grabs the cane:

Lost City of Z

12.

PERCY FAWCETT
We lead the men--we don’t beat them
into submission!
The Officer registers this, his head sinking in shame.
A SOLDIER drops a shell; they holler in caution at one
another. Then an OFFICER BARKS from behind:
Fawcett!

BARKING VOICE

Fawcett looks up: COMMANDING OFFICER SIDNEY VARNON THORNTON
and THOMAS FRANCIS BUSBY. They approach him. Fawcett
salutes.
PERCY FAWCETT

Sir!

SIDNEY VARNON THORNTON
You’re off to London tomorrow. To
the Royal Geographical Society.
Sir?

PERCY FAWCETT
The Royal Geographical--?

THOMAS FRANCIS BUSBY
YES, FAWCETT--SOMETHING WRONG WITH
YOUR EARS?!?
No, sir!

PERCY FAWCETT

SIDNEY VARNON THORNTON
Best bring your long johns. You
might well be off to the North
Pole.
THORNTON turns and leaves Fawcett standing there.

INT. RGS OFFICE - DAY

A big wooden space. Regal. Standing behind his desk: SIR
GEORGE GOLDIE. Goldie, sixties, with intense blue eyes and a
keen intelligence.

Lost City of Z

13.

Seated nearby: SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE, also sixties. Fawcett
enters. Goldie does not look up from his notes. Keltie
does, but says nothing. He merely clears his throat, with no
reaction for Goldie. After an awkward beat, Percy KNOCKS:
PERCY FAWCETT
Sir? Major Fawcett--the War Office
sent me?
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Oh yes yes--come in! I am Sir
George Goldie. President of the
RGS. This is Sir John Scott
Keltie, our Secretary.
PERCY FAWCETT
(as they shake)
How do you do.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
Good morning, Major.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Our paths did not cross during your
work here some years back.
PERCY FAWCETT
No they did not, sir. I was likely
consumed with my studies at the
time.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Of course. Please, sit down...
(F. does; a beat, then)
You’ve gone on several missions in
the past, I see?
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes. I’ve served in Ceylon, and in
Hong Kong as well. I’ve...not
stayed in one place for very long.
Goldie looks down at a stack of papers.

Keltie speaks up:

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
You also served in intelligence, in
Morocco? Is that correct?
NO ANSWER from FAWCETT.
disgust:

Goldie looks to Keltie, vaguely in

SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Are you referring to the yellow
document? The YELLOW document?

Lost City of Z

14.

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
I beg your pardon, sir. Let’s pass
on.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
(beat; back to Percy)
Your time in Ceylon--there are
rumors you went Buddhist. Such an
act would of course be seditious.
PERCY FAWCETT
Sir, my record speaks for itself.
No one can question my commitment
to King and country.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
ARE you a Buddhist, Major?
PERCY FAWCETT
My experience in the Orient taught
me that no religion is higher than
truth. I make no apologies.
A pregnant pause.

Then Goldie leans forward:

SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Major, what do you know about
Bolivia?
PERCY FAWCETT
In South America, sir?
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
That’s right.
PERCY FAWCETT
Only what I’ve read.
Goldie chuckles.

An atlas is put in front of Fawcett.

SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Then you can’t know very much.
This’s about as good a map of
Bolivia as we have.
The map literally says “UNEXPLORED”.

Referring to the map:

SIR GEORGE GOLDIE (CONT’D)
Most of it’s blank, as you can see.
Nothing’s really known of it at
all. The rivers are all a guess.
These are rubber centers here--very
profitable. Some are even
apparently quite lavish.

Lost City of Z
As Goldie forwards another book:
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE (CONT’D)
There is now considerable argument
between Bolivia and Brazil, over
what constitutes their borders. So
fantastically high is the price of
rubber that war could arise. Do
you follow?
PERCY FAWCETT
I do, sir. But with respect--I’m
not sure what it has to do with me.
Sir.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
I’m getting to that.
Goldie moves closer to Fawcett, to the edge of the desk:
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE (CONT’D)
Neither country will accept mapping
done by the other, so they’ve
requested us to act--as referee.
Keltie gets up, stands next to Goldie:
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
As you completed your courses in
mapping here with distinction, you
came under our consideration.
PERCY FAWCETT
Sirs--to be honest, my survey work
was long ago. And I was...I was
really hoping for a posting where I
might be able to see a fair bit of
action.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Oh, I do understand your concern-we’re aware you’ve never faced a
shot fired in anger. But Major,
this is far more than just survey
work. It’s exploration, in the
jungle. The environment is
brutally difficult. There’s
terrible disease and murderous
savages. The journey may well mean
your life. But should you succeed,
such an undertaking could earn you
soldierly decoration--AND even
reclaim your family name.

15.

Lost City of Z
Goldie leans back.

16.

Then:

SIR GEORGE GOLDIE (CONT’D)
You know, we knew your father.
Did you.

PERCY FAWCETT
I did not.

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
Terrible thing, a man’s love of
drink... And gaming...
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
But: as I say, success in this
venture could change your lot.
Considerably.
Fawcett looks back down at the map.

“UNEXPLORED”.

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
Well, Major? What’s it going to
be?
ANGLE ON FAWCETT as he looks up.
11

He SMILES.

EXT. NEAR THE FAWCETT HOME - BLUFFS - LATE DAY

11

ANGLE ON JACK, playing in the sand. WIDEN: Fawcett and Nina
near him. As Fawcett stares at the kid:
NINA FAWCETT
He’ll not know you when you return.
Fawcett nods.

A beat.

Then:

PERCY FAWCETT
You must protect him from the sort
of schooling to which I was
subjected.
NINA FAWCETT
(of COURSE!)
Our minds are as one on this, have
no fear of that.
PERCY FAWCETT
(to himself; aloud)
I’ll not have him caned for wearing
the wrong frock coat...
Puggy-(beat)

NINA FAWCETT

NINA FAWCETT (CONT'D)
I must tell you--I believe I’m
going to have another child.
He turns to look at her directly.

A half-smile:

PERCY FAWCETT
Another child...?
NINA FAWCETT
But this cannot distract you, or
lead you to doubt my capacities.
I’m an independent woman. And our
children could have no better
protector than their own mother.
PERCY FAWCETT
I do not doubt you.
(moves closer to her;
touches her abdomen)
The thought of you all will be my
greatest inspiration. I swear to
you, I shall succeed.

INT. FAWCETT RESIDENCE - ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY MORNING

Still dark. Fawcett is packed and ready to go. A SHOT OF
HIS SUITCASES. Fawcett stands just outside Jack’s bedroom.
Turns around to see his wife. Nina’s back is to us; she is
about to put Fawcett’s coat over his suitcase, but instead
chooses to caress the coat with enormous tenderness. As
though the coat were a living thing, a beautiful child...
She SLIPS a BOOKLET into his COAT. He comes up behind her,
touches her shoulders. She whispers, afraid to wake up Jack:
NINA FAWCETT
I’ve given you a book of poems, for
your journey.
He nods in appreciation.

JACK FAWCETT
Where are you going?
PERCY FAWCETT
Far away. You’re to look after
your mother.
JACK FAWCETT
I want to come.
Fawcett sits at the edge of the bed:
PERCY FAWCETT
Darling, I’m afraid it’s no place
for children.
Why?

JACK FAWCETT

PERCY FAWCETT
Because there’s great danger.
JACK FAWCETT
Then why are you going?
PERCY FAWCETT
We must all do our duty for King
and country, first and foremost.
Why?

JACK FAWCETT

PERCY FAWCETT
Well...this is how we keep the
world civilized.
JACK FAWCETT
What is civilized?
Fawcett laughs at all the questions.
PERCY FAWCETT
Goodbye, darling.

Then:

Nina enters from behind them.
NINA FAWCETT
Jack, give your father his present.
Jack grins, reaches under his pillow, gives his father a
small box. Inside: a gold ring. It’s all Fawcett can do to
not burst into tears. He begins to get choked up:
PERCY FAWCETT
It’s--it’s lovely.
An inscription is on it: NEC ASPERA TERRENT.
JACK FAWCETT
What do the words say, Papa?
PERCY FAWCETT
It means, “difficulties be damned”.
(beat)
Thank you so much for my beautiful
gift. When I see you next, you’ll
be ready to sit a horse.
NINA FAWCETT
Now give your father a proper kiss
so that he may be on his way...
They boy sits up; Fawcett hugs, kisses him tightly as Nina
looks on. TEARS BEGIN TO STREAM DOWN FAWCETT’S CHEEKS, but
he SMILES TO THE CHILD THROUGH THE TEARS. A SHIP HORN:

The S.S. PANAMA.

Fawcett sits in the cramped, dirty hold, which is filled with
toughs and scoundrels. Meanwhile, he looks clean-cut in a
starched white collar, focused intently on a SPANISH LANGUAGE
BOOK. Passengers drink whiskey, spit tobacco, play dice.
And sing in a drunken stupor.

Lost City of Z

20.

A PICKPOCKET is reaching around, attempting to filch
something out of Fawcett’s hanging coat.
Fawcett SEES this in the REFLECTION of a MIRROR that a man is
using for shaving, across from his bunk. He wraps his hands
around a handkerchief, and with great speed, he pulls it
around the neck of the Pickpocket and yanks him forward.
Pulls out his REVOLVER:
PERCY FAWCETT
I should think twice if I were you.
The PICKPOCKET simply withdraws his hand. A BIG FIGHT breaks
out between two DRUNKS in the game. Fawcett turns to look.
ANOTHER MAN, clutching a rifle, standing with his arm around
a woman who might well be a prostitute, catches Fawcett’s
eye. The Man takes a SWIG from a FLASK. Fawcett goes back
to his reading...

Fawcett, smoking inside the ship, walking from the dining
room.
IN THE DISTANCE, DOWN THE DECK HALL: he SPOTS the MAN with
the rifle again, now slung on his back. And the man is
staring back at him. Odd. Suspicious.
Fawcett walks around, to the other side of the ship.
MAN APPEARS AGAIN. AGAIN, staring at him.

Fawcett walks around the deck and opens a door. He ducks
into a pantry. Dark. Pulls out his weapon. Through the
grated metal window in the door, we see a SILHOUETTE
approach. A beat, as the silhouette looks inside.
The DOORKNOB moves.

Fawcett MOVES behind the door.

The door opens and the man comes in. Instantly, Fawcett
WRAPS his FOREARM AROUND THE MAN’S NECK.
The MAN PUSHES ON FAWCETT’S FACE. They TUSSLE, awkwardly,
even humorously, each trying to out-tough the other, each
proving himself sillier than the other.
When they separate, the Man PULLS a KNIFE.
Fawcett turns on the light, a solitary bulb that is turned on
or off by a string. The light SWINGS, back and forth.

PERCY FAWCETT
Who are you?
He is CORPORAL HENRY COSTIN, twenties, with a bold
Kiplingesque mustache and heavily-hooded eyes. Exceptionally
fit, having been a gymnastics instructor in the Army.
HENRY COSTIN
I’m Corporal Henry Costin, sir! I
saw your advert in the Times--I’ll
be your aide-de-camp on the
mission!
PERCY FAWCETT
(incredulous; upset)
We’ve been at sea a week--why in
God’s name haven’t you revealed
yourself until now?!
HENRY COSTIN
Had to make certain you were up to
the task, sir! I’m not looking to
get killed because you’re too long
in the tooth!
PERCY FAWCETT
You’re speaking rather loudly, Mr.
Costin.
HENRY COSTIN
(softer)
Sorry, sir.
Beat.
PERCY FAWCETT
And what if I were?
HENRY COSTIN
Were what, sir?
PERCY FAWCETT
Too long in the tooth.
HENRY COSTIN
Ah--well, then I would assume
command. Sir.

I wasn’t planning to hurt you.
PERCY FAWCETT
I assumed as much--you’re carrying
that ridiculous rifle.

Fawcett backs up, puts away his knife.

Said as a command:

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Where’s your paperwork.
Costin reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of paper,
along with a small whiskey flask. And a small, tarnished
medal with a ribbon. Fawcett looks at all of it.
HENRY COSTIN
It’s a medal. For bravery, against
the Boer.
(beat)
I’m skilled, with both pistol and
rifle, as you can see.

I myself have never been in war.

You’ve a family, Mr. Costin?
HENRY COSTIN
None at all.

PERCY FAWCETT
Nothing to shed.

HENRY COSTIN
But you do, I take it then?
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes. A wife and a boy, with
another child on the way.
HENRY COSTIN
(vaguely challenging)
And you’ll have no difficulty
shedding them?
PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Costin, my reputation as a man
rests entirely on our success. You
shall find me capable of every
sacrifice.

Lost City of Z

HENRY COSTIN
Well I must say, I for one am fair
itching for action.
PERCY FAWCETT
I’m certain you won’t be
disappointed. You’ll need every
last bit of fortitude you’ve got.
Therefore, I must insist-Fawcett takes Costin’s whiskey flask.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
You’ll need no more Dutch courage.
As Fawcett pours it into a nearby sink in the pantry, sotto:

The alcohol runs along the sink bottom.

We MATCH CUT TO:

A TRAIN rockets through the area.

19

INT. TRAIN

A crummy and cramped and loud interior. Filled with Bolivian
and indigenous peoples. Fawcett talks inaudibly with a
Bolivian, then walks toward a seat, holding a map in his
hand. He avoids a FRUITSELLER (who is ad-libbing:
“chirimoyas, grenadillas!”).
Costin is seated, READING A NEWSPAPER. THE HEADLINE:
“SHACKLETON, MURRAY TO SOUTH POLE”. A PICTURE OF SHACKLETON
and JAMES MURRAY. REMEMBER MR. MURRAY’S FACE. A Woman with
a DOG in a basket stands right near Costin when he moves to
accommodate Fawcett; the dog bothers him by continually
sniffing his ear.
Fawcett joins him in the empty seat, holding a map and a
smaller piece of paper. He seems concerned, remote.
HENRY COSTIN
There a problem?

Lost City of Z

24.

PERCY FAWCETT
We received a cable, in Asuncion.
The political situation appears to
have worsened and there’s been a
change in plan.
(to the map)
We’ll need to redirect our line of
approach--our first priority must
now be to map the Verde River and
find its source. It forms a
critical part of the border between
Bolivia and Brazil.
HENRY COSTIN
It’s rather far from here, is it
not?
PERCY FAWCETT
It is.
(unfolds the map)
Our survey route for the river
would begin here, at, at--Fazienda
Jacobina.
HENRY COSTIN
Yes, I’ve come across it in my
reading--it’s meant to be quite
enchanting.
PERCY FAWCETT
(looking at his telegram)
We’re to meet a Corporal Manley
there. He’s contacted an Indian
guide and hired the rest of our
crew.
(back to the map)
We must chart our progress with as
much survey detail as possible.
Hopefully any mail from our loved
ones will beat us to the spot.
(as he folds the map)
Time is of the essence. War is at
stake and the environment will not
be friendly.
Costin battles the dog in the basket; it keeps sniffing his
ear:
HENRY COSTIN
We’re to stop a war, you and I?
The two of us, and a couple of
mules?

PERCY FAWCETT
(speechless for a moment;
the odds ARE long; then:)
Mr. Costin--we’re going to have to
depend on each other. Because
neither of us will survive this
alone.
HENRY COSTIN
I understand perfectly, sir.
However, this DOG will not survive
this train ride.
(seeing Fawcett reading
the journal)
What’s that you’re reading?
PERCY FAWCETT
It’s a poem. For our journey.
Costin looks over at the book. CLOSE SHOT ON HANDWRITING
ABOVE THE TEXT: “TO PERCY, WITH LOVE, NINA.” We TILT DOWN to
THE TEXT, and we HEAR:

“THERE’S no sense in going further-it’s the edge of cultivation,

Fawcett is sweating. It is starting to get hot. There are
rivulets that all seem to be flowing downhill and gaining
steam. Costin stops to take notes in a survey book.
BACK TO FAWCETT: THERE IS OVERGROWN VEGETATION BLOCKING THE
VIEW on the path. Fawcett HACKS AWAY with his machete.
He STOPS.

SOMETHING SEEMS TO DAWN ON HIM.
PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Costin--

Then he starts to HACK AWAY AGAIN!
With an astonishing furor. WE PAN WITH HIM with each BLOW.
His FEET are in mud; seeing this:
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Mr. Costin!
HENRY COSTIN
What is it...?
Costin approaches quickly.
AMAZONIA.

Finally, a clearing.

REVEALING:

A VAST GREEN. The JUNGLE, which engulfs the riverbanks of the
magnificent AMAZON RIVER. It is beautiful and beguiling, and
so enormous it fills one with awe.
Costin comes up behind him, looking over Fawcett’s shoulder.
He is blown away by the vista.
My God...

HENRY COSTIN (CONT’D)

PERCY FAWCETT
(almost to himself)
It’s even grander than one could
have imagined...
Stifling the briefest of smiles, Fawcett goes right back to
putting up a steely front. He starts going through his
things. But he cannot hide his excitement. As he rummages:
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
The manual insists we keep only the

The SOUNDS of the jungle are loud and yet oddly soothing. It
should be clear to us from the noises that nature has taken
over. BUZZING of unidentifiable creatures...

Fawcett, Costin ENTER THE JUNGLE in SILENCE... ONLY THE

Fawcett and Costin’s feet sink in mud; a bright YELLOW SNAKE
slithers around Fawcett’s feet. Costin’s eyes widen at the
sight of it; Fawcett steps over it with studied calm...
Sweat pours off their faces; terrible HEAT... SWARMING
INSECTS... SAUBA ANTS... TICKS... CHIGGERS...
Percy Fawcett BREATHES heavily but HACKS away with his
machete. Costin is nearby, slightly ahead, HACKING AWAY at
the JUNGLE. Occasionally, Fawcett stops to check a map,
takes out his surveying equipment. He calls out:
PERCY FAWCETT
Twenty-nine degrees, 16 minutes,
south of the equator.
HENRY COSTIN
Twenty-nine, and sixteen!
PERCY FAWCETT
(as he starts hacking
again)
Tell me, Mr. Costin! What induced
you to brave this place?

At least I prefer it to all the

SMACK. Fawcett hits his own neck. BUGS, which force the men
constantly to be swatting their arms and necks. Then Costin
stops. Freezes.
PERCY FAWCETT
(as a joke)
Every one we kill is one less
obstacle in our path!

Some of them are edible, though.
HENRY COSTIN

PERCY FAWCETT
(brought back to reality)
Yes, Mr. Costin--what is it?

Why are you not proceeding?
Costin points down. Fawcett SEES a track of FOOTPRINTS.
Looking around, they SPOT:
THROUGH THE TREES AND THE BRANCHES AND THE SHRUBS: INDIANS.
STILL. SILENTLY WATCHING THEM.
Fawcett stares STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES of ONE OF THE INDIANS.
He then gestures to Costin to KEEP MOVING. He and Costin
both put their hands on their guns as they begin to plod ever
slower through the greenery.
THE INDIANS OBSERVE FAWCETT AND COSTIN with an astonishing
stillness; almost like statues.
Fawcett SEES A SEA OF SHRUNKEN HEADS, hanging from trees.
HENRY COSTIN
(whispered)
[Are they] cannibals?
Fawcett shakes his head just a touch, as if to say, “I do not
know”, and signals to Costin to keep walking...

AND THEN FAWCETT AND COSTIN HEAR IT: OPERA MUSIC.
At first, it is distant. Then, less faint, and as they
progress, one can even tell the piece: from Gaetano
Donizetti’s DON PASQUALE. Both men wonder if they’re crazy.
They reach a clearing, slowly but surely making their way
through the gauntlet of Indians. And what do they see but...

EXT. CLEARING

A THATCHED-ROOF MAKESHIFT STAGE that is serving as an “OPERA

surreal. Fawcett turns to the Indians, who are surrounding
the two men. In imperfect Portuguese:

Do you understand?
They don’t answer. Instead, they back up, melting away back
into the jungle. Fawcett enters the:

Fawcett surveys the scene. Even though it’s merely a large
clearing, the stage is, oddly, MAGNIFICENTLY APPOINTED with
antiques from Old Europe. They’re scattered about.
Pathetic space, but you’d never know it listening to the
singers and the orchestra. A smattering of people dressed to
the nines in the audience--wood benches in the middle of the
rainforest.
In the back, Indians sit, quietly, listening to the music. A
bizarre sight indeed. A DIMINUTIVE LATINO MAN dressed in a
tuxedo approaches Fawcett. In Portuguese:

JUNE,

The RAIN begins to FALL. HARD. FAR FROM THE ELEGANT PLACE
THEY’D EXPECTED. Fawcett enters this nightmare of a rubber
town, with Costin right behind.
We PASS TREES with PANS attached to their TRUNKS. LEAKING
WHITE FLUID. RUBBER. A DARK-SKINNED MAN is collecting the
substance...
Fawcett sees that this is not much more than a strip of mud
with bamboo huts with one notable exception: a RUBBER BARON’S
LARGE HOME, which sits higher on a hill overlooking the city.
Shockingly miserable. FIRES all over--in cans, campfires,
fires incinerating garbage and remains...
The presence of the Inca Mining Company is clear, with their
corporate logo painted on several of the huts.
Fawcett turns, eyes: RAILROAD TRACKS that lead to nowhere.
BOLIVIAN ARMY OFFICERS line the fronts of the huts, “on the
nod,” drunk, all of it. A TEXAN GUNMAN stands out, watching.
Running down the “road,” comes: BRITISH OFFICER ARTHUR
MANLEY, early twenties, young and cheery but slightly frail.
Fawcett is still stunned by the misery as Manley begins:
ARTHUR MANLEY
Major Fawcett? Is that you?? It
MUST be you!
(introducing himself)
Lance Corporal Manley, sir--liason
from the Governor General!
PERCY FAWCETT
How do you do... This is Corporal
Costin.
Costin nods.
ARTHUR MANLEY
You weren’t expected for another
fortnight! I...hate to be the
bearer of bad news, but--we
received a telegraph. The Border
Commission has cancelled your
mission!
PERCY FAWCETT
Cancelled!? What on earth do you
mean?!?

ARTHUR MANLEY
What I’ve said, sir! It’s become
far too dangerous--there’ve already
been more than a few skirmishes
between the Bolivians and
Brazilians, and they won’t be able
to reprovision you as planned!
PERCY FAWCETT
Where is the government office?
ARTHUR MANLEY
Government?
(morbid smile)
Sir, I’m afraid you’ve left
“government” behind a long time
ago. We’re grateful for the road!
PERCY FAWCETT
Then Mr. Manley, you send back a
telegram--that we will not stand
down and we shall proceed as
planned! We will CONTINUE and see
this through!
Manley looks at him for a moment.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Are you WITH me, Corporal?
Yessir.

ARTHUR MANLEY

As Fawcett looks at Costin, as if to say, “My God, this is a
terrible place”:
PERCY FAWCETT
Now what about an Indian guide--did
you get us a guide?
ANGLE ON MANLEY as he stops.

He turns stone-faced.

ARTHUR MANLEY

MANLEY SPEAKS TO THE GUARDS. A BRAZILIAN GUARD CLAPS his

not react. He then steps out from the huge line as though it
were voluntary.

INT. RUBBER BARON HOUSE

BARON DE GONDORIZ, forty, a stocky and imperious sort, sits
on a CHAIR, surrounded by furs and with a Latino woman
serving him drink and food. The Brazilian Infantry is here,
surrounding (guarding?) him. An INDIAN CRANKS A VICTROLA.
DE GONDORIZ’S CHILDREN are here, too, as is his wife. They
are dressed in WHITE SUITS and are serious-faced and silent.
Champagne is poured like water, and food abounds. It’s a
real contrast with the street below.
Gondoriz is an imposing figure, to be sure. He has a pet
JAGUAR, who resides alongside him. The jaguar seems
particularly peeved at Costin, for no reason. It growls at
him, and Costin’s eyes bulge at the ferocious “pet”...
PERCY FAWCETT

Baron, we’re from the British Army.
We’re very sorry to interrupt your
meal. We’re to be venturing down
the Rio Verde as peacekeepers and

It’s the most we can do under the

PERCY FAWCETT
Would your hands be any cleaner if

EXT. EDGE OF THE RIVER - MIDDAY

Fawcett, Costin, Manley, Willis, Dan, Urquhart, the silent
and tall DESPERADOS, Tadjui and the 4 LEJO INDIANS push off
on TWO LARGE RAFTS. Three SMALL HOUNDS ACCOMPANY THE MEN.
A CROWD has assembled around the group as they depart. The
Indians sing a local folk song as they shove off. MANY OF
THE BRAZILIAN INFANTRY set off their Winchesters into the air
to celebrate. The INDIAN WOMEN wave their goodbyes...
The BARON and his TEXAN GUNMAN eye the men from higher up.
The TEXAN DRAWS HIS FINGER ACROSS HIS NECK, smiling...

Fawcett averts his gaze, looks down at his MAP. We TILT DOWN
to SEE THE WORD: “UNEXPLORED”. The river is READY.
35

EXT. RICARDO FRANCO HILLS

35

The group drifts on their rafts through a cavernous space,
with eerie plateaus of the Ricardo Franco Hills on both sides
of the rafts. FAWCETT’S MEN push with the bamboo poles
through the water as FAWCETT SURVEYS. The camera PANS PAST
his notes on flora and fauna and temperature and barometric
readings, all painstakingly done. His attention, however,
begins to be divided between his surveying and the
astonishing scenery around him.
BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW-COLORED FISH swim in the river next to
enormous EELS. DAN turns to COSTIN, re the eels:
DAN
They’ll shock you to death, those
things. Other fish, the candiru-they’ll swim right up your johnson-so don’t never be letting loose in
the river.
HENRY COSTIN
(wide smile; sarcastic)
Thank you so very much for that
information.
Costin then reflexively touches his crotch. It is SILENT, so
Fawcett turns to Manley, and, half-jokingly:
PERCY FAWCETT
Can you play?
(beat)
We don’t want to be driven mad by
the silence.
Fawcett points to Manley’s accordion case.
ARTHUR MANLEY
Right, sir.
Manley takes out his ACCORDION. The sounds ECHO, all over
the space. MANLEY PLAYS a BRITISH WAR SONG. The accordion
sounds like a full orchestra here...

EERIE QUIET. SURVEYING BOOKS: THE MAP IS BEING FILLED IN,
slowly but surely. TILT UP: Fawcett is taking photographs.

The Indians are assembled in one corner of one of the rafts.
Tadjui plays a ZAMPONA (the Incan PAN FLUTE).
Fawcett finishes his work, and folding the tripod legs,
observes the mailbag. He reaches into his pocket and opens
up the LETTER from his wife. Unwrapping it, a PICTURE FALLS
OUT. A BABY, along with JACK and NINA. A NEWBORN with his
family. Costin picks it up:
HENRY COSTIN
A new one, Major? A boy?
PERCY FAWCETT
It must be so.
Fawcett takes the picture, looks at it.
HENRY COSTIN
Congratulations.
PERCY FAWCETT
Thank you, Mr. Costin.
He then POCKETS THE PHOTO.
THE PHOTO OUT AGAIN.

Costin eyes him.

FAWCETT TAKES

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
The boy’s name is “Brian”.
HENRY COSTIN
Major, if I may venture a
suggestion-Fawcett sees Costin point to the photo, then to his pocket.
Fawcett stares at Costin, then, deciding Costin is right,
NODS ONCE AND PUTS THE PHOTO BACK in his POCKET:
PERCY FAWCETT
Right, Mr. Costin...
37

EXT. RIVER - MOMENTS LATER
The two RAFTS travel one right behind the other, as the
overgrowth gets lower and lower over the banks of this
narrowing AMAZON TRIBUTARY. They approach an abandoned
steamer on the river: a German ship, the ANTONIA. From
Hamburg, painted on its back.
As this is happening, Urquhart is on the flat raft,
attempting to catch fish with the net. With his thick
accent:

37

Lost City of Z
URQUHART
Nothing again! Not ONE fish!
a desert--a green desert!

42.

It’s

PERCY FAWCETT
Pull it in, we’ll try further down.
Fawcett steps onto the raft, to help Urquhart pull the net
in.
SIMULTANEOUS, on the batelon:
ARTHUR MANLEY
What on earth’s she doing all the
way out here?
PERCY FAWCETT
(turning back)
She’s come to load rubber, no
doubt.
(to Costin)
Get us closer, Mr. Costin! Maybe
they’ll have news, or food for us!
HENRY COSTIN
Looks abandoned to my eye!
As he steers, Costin NOTICES a BLACK SPOT IN HIS SKIN.
OH.

UH-

DAN
(as they get closer,
seeing “HAMBURG”)
It’s German! I say we go aboard
and have a beer--I bet they have
real German beer, fresh from the
cask!
But, as they get closer, they see something macabre: A LONE
MAN, maybe dead, maybe not, sits on the top of the boat,
still. Nude. Staring at them, not moving. The hull’s
riddled with arrows.
URQUHART
Is he ALIVE? Try to talk to him!
See where they are from in-And he FREEZES. FAWCETT, next to him, is momentarily
bewildered. THEN: HE SEES AN ARROW in his BACK.
URQUHART SPINS OFF THE RAFT, TANGLED IN THE FISHING NET.

Lost City of Z

43.

ALL OF A SUDDEN: FLYING ARROWS. FEROCIOUS. AND SPEARS.
Coming from the trees. We can’t SEE any other INDIANS, but
they’re there, in the forest.
The flurry does not stop. All the men duck for cover.
PANIC. The arrows come with tremendous and frightening
force, some of them penetrating inches deep into the rafts’
wood.
Costin pushes with his long BAMBOO pole. The rafts begin to
drift in an altogether different direction, away from the
arrows.
38

EXT. CENTER OF THE RIVER

38

Fawcett IS YANKED INTO THE RIVER by Urquhart, who is dying
and has tangled the two of them in the fishing net. The
arrows continue to fly.
The RAFT TILTS DANGEROUSLY with the weight shift.
Costin tumbles as well, but stays aboard, making sure THE
MAPBOOKS survive. He loses his JOURNAL book and other
personal items in the mayhem, however, as the bag of
photographs falls overboard:
HENRY COSTIN
God damn it! GET THEM OUT!
Manley attempts to retrieve the net-39

INT. UNDERWATER

39

Fawcett is underwater, with Urquhart atop him as the two
struggle with the rope. FAWCETT untangles his feet from the
rope and pulls himself up, attempting to grab Urquhart as he
rises to the surface. One thing gets in the way:
PIRANHAS.
Piranhas start nipping at the men. The piranhas focus on
Urquhart, who was cut by the arrow--the blood is attracting
them. The feeding has begun to turn into a FRENZY.
Getting pinched by the fish as well--though with nowhere near
the ferocity, for he has no open wound--Fawcett is forced to
abandon Urquhart and PULLS HIMSELF ALONG THE ROPE.
COSTIN GRABS FAWCETT and helps pull him onto the RAFT.

EXT. RAFT

Fawcett gets aboard the raft with more than a couple of
piranhas still attached to his arms and legs. Fawcett and
Costin swat away the piranhas and, courageously braving the
still-constant stream of arrows, tries to get Urquhart
aboard:
PERCY FAWCETT
Come on, pull!
Manley and the others help, with Tadjui looking on. Fawcett
finally succeeds in pulling Urquhart up, onto the raft.
And he is DEAD. His lower half has been completely devoured
by the piranhas...
The RAFTS FINALLY PASS THE FLURRY OF ARROWS AND SPEARS. The
last FLURRY OF SPEARS hit near the raft without incident...
ANGLE ON FAWCETT. Out of breath and spent beyond words. He
SEES his PERSONAL EFFECTS--the LETTER, the FAMILY
PHOTOGRAPHS, on the raft and soaked. They’d been spilled
during the chaos.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Thank you for your aid, Mr. Costin.
Costin nods. Fawcett’s face wrinkles in anguished
recognition of his articles’ damage. HE COLLECTS HIS THINGS.
DISSOLVE TO:
41

EXT. THE AMAZON JUNGLE - SHALLOW RIVER BED - DUSK

Rain. Silence. Gloom. Fear. All stumble, quietly, as they
help pull the boats across shallow water. FAWCETT is still
alert. The MAPBOOKS are getting more and more completed...
Virtually no more food in the containers. The hounds rummage
alongside the rafts, sniffing at anything they can lick or
chew.
MORE BUGS: flies, mosquitos, spiders, maggots in the skin.
Costin, who has now grown very sick with fever, shivers in
the rain as he can barely walk. Manley VOMITS black fluid.
Hunched by the edge of the raft:
ARTHUR MANLEY
I...I’m sick...I think I’ve

bake the fever out of me!

Dan is hallucinating; he mutters about his hallucinations
aloud:
DAN
Months on the river! And--so many

Dan has MAGGOTS in his ARM.
DAN (CONT’D)
My maggots... Are they...they’re my
friends!
He SMILES.
Fawcett sees Costin, who hides his own skin blemish, on his
arm. Costin makes eye contact, pulling down his sleeve:
HENRY COSTIN
It’s nothing at all...
Percy moves to Tadjui:
PERCY FAWCETT
Are we close?
TADJUI
Many week to go. The river still
strong.
Fawcett looks at his men, then back to Tadjui:

EXT. BY THE CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

The members of the group sit with their rifles aimed into the
darkness. They see the TWINKLES from the eyes of animals out
into that dark. The noises of the jungle frighten them
beyond belief. Then the jungle goes SILENT. Then the noises
pick up again. Terrifying. Even the hounds are petrified.
Fawcett sits near the fire, rifle aimed outward into the
dark. Costin, without his Martini-Henry rifle, is covered in
blankets. HUSHED, SHIVERING.
PERCY FAWCETT
(to Costin, whispered)
Mr. Costin? Mr. Costin, are you
alert?
HENRY COSTIN
(a morbid joke as he
shivers)
I am, feeling just fit as a fiddle.
How you have managed to avoid any

I’d like you to read this to me.

Fawcett reaches into his pocket. Takes out many envelopes.
Sifts through the letters. Hands one to Costin:

What a mistake to come here...
He GRABS HIS HEAD, each palm of his hand on each side of his
head. Closes his eyes in ANGUISH. As Fawcett wipes tears
from his face:
HENRY COSTIN
Major--I’m not one for speeches.
And if I should die here, I know my
name dies with me. But I have
fought as a soldier, and I have
tasted victory. What have you
tasted--besides your unrealized
dreams? If you allow yourself to
perish here, you will have achieved
nothing. Now that my fever has
come on, I may well not survive.
Indeed, I am of little use in my
current state. But you must
persevere.
(a sardonic smile)
And may I add, if you should manage
to take me with you, I’ll not
protest.
PERCY FAWCETT
(he smiles as the words
sink in; checks his
chronometer)
I shall endeavor to do both, Mr.
Costin.
(louder, to the group)
Six hours rest. Dawn’s
approaching.
Dan, collapsed at the base of a tree nearby, begs Fawcett:
DAN
Please, Mr. Fawcett--I’m not fit.
I, I think I might be near my end
in this bloody hell.
PERCY FAWCETT
You can walk, can you not?
Dan can, but does not answer. Fawcett takes out his BIG
KNIFE. Moves up to Dan, puts his blade to Dan’s throat:

Fawcett may be frail, but he is at least mentally in control
of himself--unlike the others. Costin is either unconscious
or DEAD.
PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Costin...? Mr. Costin?
Fawcett is visibly upset that Costin does not answer. Tadjui
prays aloud... Manley is shivering terribly and covered with
maggots; HE IS STICKING HIS TONGUE OUT, TO CATCH THE RAIN AS
IT FALLS FOR HYDRATION. Dan is muttering to himself, aloud;
he also sticks out his tongue for the rain’s water. Even the
dogs have gone totally lethargic, and the carcass of one of
them slides into the river.
Willis rummages through the food baskets. Nothing but a
couple of rotten fruit. He begins to cry:
WILLIS
No more food! Ain’t nothing left-NOTHING-ONLY A ROTTEN BANANA REMAINS. Willis charges for it; Dan and
he FIGHT OVER IT BRIEFLY. SEEING this: Fawcett gets up,
approaches the men:
PERCY FAWCETT
Stop it--get--we’re not savages!
Tadjui stops playing the zampona.

He stands.

DAN
We’re leaving our bones here! And
for what?!? A map??? We’re not
even lookin’ for gold!
Dan STEPS BACK, ARMED. He approaches Fawcett, dangerously
close, with his RIFLE POINTED AT FAWCETT:
DAN (CONT’D)
There could be war already and we
wouldn’t even know it! Have you
ever considered that?!

Lost City of Z
Dan turns to the others.

He is ready to CHARGE.

MUTINY?!?

DAN (CONT’D)
Even if we get there, we ain’t
makin’ it back with nothing in our

still directed to others)
Let’s have at him!
Fawcett looks at the others. With the exception of Costin
and Manley, both of whom now LOOK UNCONSCIOUS if NOT DEAD,
they all SEEM READY TO CHARGE AT HIM. Fawcett seems to steel
himself.
Dan TAKES A STEP FORWARD, and Fawcett’s eyes widen. Then
FAWCETT CATCHES SIGHT OF COSTIN--WHO HAS TURNED TOWARD US,
HOLDING HIS PISTOL! (Dan has his back to Costin and cannot
see.)
Dan takes a step TOWARD Fawcett, ready to do away with him,
when--COSTIN FIRES! Dan CURLS OVER with a STUNNING VIOLENCE,

howling in pain.

Costin takes the camera and plants it on a TRIPOD for THE

A group of very comfortable British soldiers are at work at
their desks as one BRITISH SECRETARY types at the front desk.
Smiles, joking. Then they STOP.
Percy Fawcett walks into the building. He looks and smells
like hell, filthy and unshaven and shaking like a leaf from
malnutrition. Hair completely out of control, his beard at
epic length.
He approaches an official (CECIL GOSLING) at the front desk.
The official, whose nose crinkles up--presumably at the
stench of Fawcett--seems bewildered. Fawcett SHAKES LIKE A
LEAF; is he mad?
CECIL GOSLING
May I...help you, sir?
PERCY FAWCETT
Tell me please--is there war,
between Bolivia and Brazil? I’ll
fight if I’m needed.
CECIL GOSLING
(baffled)
War? No, sir--there’s no war. Is
there something we might do for
you?
PERCY FAWCETT
My name is Major Percy Fawcett. If
you could, please contact my family
through the Royal Geographical
Society, in London.
SLAM! Fawcett DUMPS a series of frayed map notebooks on the
desk. He also EMPTIES HIS POCKETS OF POTTERY SHARDS. A
BRITISH OFFICIAL (”SIMON BEAUCLERK”) with his back to us
overhears this. He seems interested, turns. Approaches.

Meanwhile, Fawcett is hurriedly throwing everything on the
desk:

ENTERING, almost crawling in now, behind Fawcett: COSTIN,
MANLEY, WILLIS.

I believe I got your orders on my
desk just last week. You were
supposed to arrive here in July

Fawcett looks up, sees a calendar on the wall: “AUGUST.”

I’m, I’m so very sorry, it’s

eleven months early. You’ve mapped
the entire Verde tributary a year

HE AND THE OTHER OFFICERS ARE ASTONISHED. Another British
Officer, seeing how frail Fawcett looks, runs to get a chair
and positions it right behind Fawcett:

A whole host of officers now seem to realize what’s going on

gala.) Fawcett is THE TOAST OF THE TOWN. Sir George Goldie
SWALLOWS him up, moves him away from Nina. Nina and Percy
exchange bemused looks as he is pulled away:
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Percy! Come... Meet our host. He
is most anxious to meet you. I
must say, he is the most marvelous
of men. A person of
considerable... resources. And of
the finest stock.

INT. MURRAY LIVING ROOM

A magnificent room, with long tables and sofas and beautiful
paintings on the walls. ALL MEN, dressed in black tie. The
top brass of the RGS: Sir John Scott Keltie, Sir George
Goldie, others.
AND: MR. JAMES MURRAY, fifty-five and dashing, with graying
hair and a well-trimmed mustache. We remember him somehow-the cover of that newspaper!
Cigars are smoked. The air is thick with wealth and decorum.
It could not be further from the jungle here, as SERVANTS
PLACE CUPS with SAUCERS DOWN IN PERFECT SYNCHRONIZED RHYTHM.
JAMES MURRAY
Major Fawcett--what an honor! What
an HONOR! Everyone’s talking about
your mission. Just remarkable, a
real triumph!

Major, this is Mr. James Murray.

How do you do.

Very well, very well...

JAMES MURRAY
I read your editorial in the Times
this morning--about the slave trade
in the Americas. Truly
enlightened. Poor savages.
PERCY FAWCETT
The native does deserve our
sympathy. We’ve only just
scratched the surface in Amazonia.
JAMES MURRAY
Yes, certainly, there’s much more
territory to be charted! You know,
I am a biologist and explorer
myself--I was second-in-command to
Mr. Shackelton on his Antartica
expedition.
PERCY FAWCETT
I don’t think there’s anyone here
who’s not well aware of your
achievements, Mr. Murray. You’ve
distinguished yourself with great
bravery.
JAMES MURRAY
(a bit of false modesty)
Oh, it’s nothing compared to
Amazonia. Surveying the Amazon’s
always been a great goal of mine.
PERCY FAWCETT
I would hope the RGS continues its
pursuits. But I believe mapmaking
should be of secondary interest
now. I witnessed many
archeological sightings of great
significance.
Some guy interrupts MURRAY.
one (more from him later):

He is WILLIAM BARCLAY, thirty-

WILLIAM BARCLAY
Mr. Murray!
Murray turns to talk to him; Sir John Scott Keltie moves in.
To Fawcett; sotto:
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
My friend--your recent exploits
have opened every door to you--so I
would suggest keeping such
sightings to yourself.

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE (CONT'D)
Of course, no one here would
dispute you believed you saw it.
But a trip like that--very hard on
the mind. Very hard.
The evening changes now for Fawcett.

He DARKENS.

PERCY FAWCETT
Sir John, my mind is perfectly fit-and thank heavens, still open.
Fawcett steps away from Keltie and eyes JAMES MURRAY, holding
court. Others around him LAUGH at a joke we cannot HEAR.
Then, re a painting behind him:

I have painted these works.

It is FILLED with artifacts--from Amazonia, from Ceylon, from
other exotic locations: spears, Indian blankets, pottery,
Incan attire. And the Buddha. The TICK-TOCK and GONG of a
grandfather clock...
Young JACK excitedly leafs through his father’s SCRAPBOOK,
wearing a piece of Amazonian Indian headgear. He is
fascinated. Toddler Brian pulls out some Indian necklaces.
Percy enters:

you wish to play you may go

NINA FAWCETT
You might think to donate much of
this to the RGS. They can preserve
it better than we can.
PERCY FAWCETT
(looks at her; beat)
I’m not going to do that.

She moves to

61.

NINA FAWCETT
(surprised, confused)
Why not?
PERCY FAWCETT
They believe I’m crazed, prone to
hallucination. They value only the
survey work. They do not respect
my archeological discovery at all.
NINA FAWCETT
(re: pottery on the desk)
Then I suggest you either ignore
them or you prove your case, in
public. You have those pieces as
evidence. You can show them. And
if we must, we shall find more
evidence.
(beat)
Then we shall find more evidence.
As they will not yet allow a woman
through the doors of their august
establishment, we will look
elsewhere and prove your case in
public.
ANGLE ON FAWCETT.

His FACE LIGHTENS.

PERCY FAWCETT
If they only knew... you would be
the true cause of their envy.

INT. TRINITY COLLEGE LIBRARY - DUBLIN - ARCHIVES

It is the dark and vast archives of the famed library.
Fawcett is in the stacks, looking through materials.
SUPERIMPOSE: “FEBRUARY 1909.”
He takes out some FOLDERS, walks over to the big table where
Nina sits, her hands full of ancient paper. Fawcett sits
down across from her, begins to look through the items in his
own folders.
PERCY FAWCETT
Arrow drawings, meant to represent
fractional distances, evidence of
advanced mathematics. It’s
incredible...
(to Nina)
I should have engaged the Indians
more directly--they no doubt had a
great deal to teach me.

Lost City of Z

62.

No response from Nina, who had been sifting through another
set of old and frayed documents, letters, writings. She
SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED. Staring at one YELLOWED PIECE OF
PAPER, for seconds on end.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Cheeky?
(beat)
Cheeky, did you hear me?
Nina does not look over at Fawcett. She does not move, just
stares at that paper. At last, Nina looks at Fawcett.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
What is it?
NINA FAWCETT
I believe you have got your proof.
At that moment, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to REVEAL THE YELLOWED
DOCUMENT. Then we HEAR:

INT. ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY - AUDITORIUM

The room is PACKED with dozens of scientists and explorers
from across Europe. CIVILIANS line the BALCONIES. In the
first level, we NOTICE that MEN sit with each other, and what
few WOMEN there are sit in a separate section, fanning
themselves.
PERCY FAWCETT is in front of the room, near JAMES MURRAY;
NINA SHOWS UP, sits in the WOMEN’S SECTION.
HENRY COSTIN and ARTHUR MANLEY enter, all smiles, and go to
their seats. SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE, the secretary of the
RGS, and SIR GEORGE GOLDIE are next to Fawcett, in great
humor.
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Revel in this, my dear boy. You
will relive it with your children
until the end of your days.
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes, Sir George. I shall try.
Keltie has stepped up to the podium and is banging on the
hammer:
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
Gentlemen, good afternoon.

Lost City of Z

63.

HOOTS, HOLLERS, CHEERS. WILD APPLAUSE.
(The MEETING IS LIKE A ROWDY BRITISH PARLIAMENT MEETING, with
interruptions and yelling par for the course.)
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE (CONT’D)
I should like to introduce one of
our brothers, whose achievements
are well-known here and not
inconsiderable--the Honorable Mr.
James Murray!
ROUSING APPLAUSE.

A BEAMING James Murray stands:

JAMES MURRAY
I met a remarkable man but a few
months ago upon his return from a
place no one here has ever
ventured. Major Percy Fawcett has
demonstrated--to me, at least--that
there is a place where the explorer
can go forth and exhibit
perseverance, energy, courage,
forethought, and all those
qualities of an explorer of the
times now passing away. Gentlemen,
I give you...MAJOR PERCY FAWCETT!
As Fawcett stands, amidst cheers, we overhear a whisper from
William Barclay:
WILLIAM BARCLAY
Now for fairy tales from the
resident Buddhist!
PERCY FAWCETT
My esteemed colleagues...it is now
my firm belief that Amazonia is far
more than the green desert many of
us had supposed. I am proposing
that Amazonia contains a hidden
civilization--one that may well
predate our own.
MURMURS. SKEPTICISM. The room is RESTLESS.
STANDING in the CROWD:
WILLIAM BARCLAY
Major Fawcett, I am Mr. William
Barclay, of Bedford. I have been
in South America.
PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Barclay.

Interrupting,

Lost City of Z
WILLIAM BARCLAY
To be clear: are you insisting on
mythical kingdoms of gold? Those
fantasies lured the Conquistadors
to destruction-PERCY FAWCETT
SIR--it was the Conquistadors and
WE who have been destroying
Amazonia. This is a crime that
must be stopped. I have seen with
my own eyes evidence of their
civilization and I assure you it is
real-RANDOM SCIENTIST
What is your point?
PERCY FAWCETT
Perhaps it is too difficult for
some of you to admit. We, who have
been steeped in the bigotry of the
Church for so long, cannot give
much credence to an “older
civilization”--particularly one
created by a race the white man has
so brutally condemned to slavery
and death. YET WE MUST ENGAGE WITH
THIS RACE, TO COME TO KNOW THEM AND
LEARN FROM THEM, UNDERSTAND THEIR
CUSTOMS AND LANGUAGES-WILLIAM BARCLAY
Savages, in Westminster Abbey!
LAUGHTER.

Percy, shouting the first word:
PERCY FAWCETT
HENCE your disrespect--but I ask
you, what is at stake? If we may
learn of a city where one was
considered impossible to exist, it
might well write a whole new
chapter in human history. Man
would be shown as a conqueror of
his environment and not a slave to
it!

Outright BOOING now.

Fawcett shouts over the boos:

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
CONSIDER MY EVIDENCE! My sightings
of statues and archeological finds!

Fawcett HOLDS UP A PIECE OF POTTERY:
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Antiquities as sophisticated as any
in Asia or Europe, in the middle of
the jungle!
RANDOM SCIENTIST #2
Pots and pans, pots and pans!
Many in the ROOM begin to chant, “POTS AND PANS!” Costin,
who is finding all of this most amusing, leans forward, cups
his hands around his mouth and screams:
HENRY COSTIN
Shut your hole!
Then LAUGHS RIOTOUSLY at his own outburst. Fawcett
continues, himself most amused at the riot he’s causing:
PERCY FAWCETT
(yelling above the crowd)
AND after my return from the
jungle, I have examined a signal
document dating from the
Conquistadors. It states explicitly
the discovery of a lost city in
Amazonia! Uncovered earlier this
week, a copy in the archives of
Trinity College in Dublin. Its
original from Rio De Janeiro,
written by a Portuguese soldier.
”Historical account, large, hidden
ancient city, 1753. We came upon
ruins of an ancient city, bedecked
with gold. Stone archways, roads,
temple, ancient symbols.”
El Dorado!

WILLIAM BARCLAY

PERCY FAWCETT
No, gentlemen--I call it “Z”--the
ultimate piece of the human puzzle!
It is there and we must find it!
James Murray stands.

Shouts, pointing:

JAMES MURRAY
MR. FAWCETT! I SAY WE RETURN! WE
WILL GO AND FIND THE GLORY!!! WHAT
SAY YOU?!?
FAWCETT BEAMS.

HE POINTS BACK TO MURRAY:

66.

PERCY FAWCETT
MR. MURRAY, I WILL MEET THAT
CHALLENGE! I WILL GO BACK!
Fawcett looks around the room.

Which begins to explode.

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
MR. COSTIN! I SEE YOU, SEATED UP
THERE!
Costin stands, POINTING DIRECTLY AT FAWCETT:
HENRY COSTIN
MR. FAWCETT! THAT JUNGLE IS HELL-BUT-(smiles)
BUT ONE KIND OF LIKES IT! I WILL
RETURN!
PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Manley! What say YOU?!?
ARTHUR MANLEY
I WILL INDEED, SIR! I AM WITH YOU!
NINA stands, CLAPPING. ANGLE ON HENRY COSTIN and ARTHUR
MANLEY, here too, as they stand on their feet, applauding.
JAMES MURRAY is basking, a KING here. Others JEER, however.
Slightly humbled, William Barclay SITS DOWN.
Percy Fawcett remains standing at the podium, determined, now
even somewhat amused by the insanity he’s caused...

Percy and Nina, in bed. Dark. A beat. They are touching
each other’s hands. It should have the mood of being postcoital.
It is raining outside.

After a beat:

PERCY FAWCETT
I have such high hopes, Cheeky...
(beat)
Mr. James Murray has added
immeasurably to the luster of our
mission. And...with his
participation, I genuinely believe
we may have acquired the keys to
immortality.
ANGLE ON NINA as she ponders mentioning something.

And then:

NINA FAWCETT
(readies herself)
I...do believe I am quite ready to
accompany you on your next journey
as well.
Fawcett is surprised and flummoxed:
What...?

PERCY FAWCETT

NINA FAWCETT
The children will be off to school
by the time it would begin. And
I’ve learned to read the stars and
navigate, and become very wellversed in the history of the

After all, it was I who found the

PERCY FAWCETT
(dumbfounded; stuttering-with a laugh)
That would be--impossible. It’s
not a place at all for a woman.
She sits up:
NINA FAWCETT
Not a place? We believe firmly in
the equality between us.
So does he, now:

Equality, yes--of course. But in
mind, not in body. The rigors of
such a trip would be beyond your
imagination.
She turns away from him, turning onto the edge of the bed.

NINA FAWCETT
I believe it is generally
acknowledged that the pain a woman
experiences in childbirth far
exceeds anything a man must endure.
PERCY FAWCETT
This is not about childbirth--

A

68.

NINA FAWCETT
What do you know of childbirth?
Have you witnessed a minute of it,
much less endured it?
He gets up, out of the bed, walks to face her.

Kneeling:

PERCY FAWCETT
Cheeky--the jungle is years of hard
work and experience in the art of
soldiering. It’s about maggots in
your skin, and deadly snakes, and
disease. I love you and I could
not bear that.
(beat)
The children need their mother.
She gets up, off the bed, walks to her dresser. He STANDS,
does not approach her (instead, staying close to the bed).
NINA FAWCETT
Somehow I was able to bear the
dangers you faced, the years you
were gone. This way, we might be
together-PERCY FAWCETT
You’re my wife. I need you here,
not as a tentmate in need of
constant care. Be reasonable.
She turns to him, flush with anger:
NINA FAWCETT
You will throw “reasonable” in my
face?
PERCY FAWCETT (SIMULTANEOUS)
I’m simply speaking the truth-She approaches him, strong and evincing a centeredness:
NINA FAWCETT
Was it reasonable to stay here and
struggle to provide for the
children while you wandered the
jungle? Now you’ve no relationship
with them whatsoever. And you have
given no thought to my aspirations.
He turns away from her, his hand slicing the air as he makes
his points:

Lost City of Z

69.

PERCY FAWCETT
Men and women have each performed
their roles since the beginnings of
time. This is a cornerstone of our
civilization. A man does not take
his wife into the most dangerous
place in the world on a whim!
NINA FAWCETT
I did expect more understanding
from you and I am disgraced by your
ignorant posture!
Young JACK enters. He stares at the quarreling couple.
GRABS ONTO HIS MOTHER’S LEG with a FEROCIOUSNESS:

He

NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
I’m all right, darling. Your
father and I were just having a
discussion.
Jack will not let go of his mother as he STARES at HIS
FATHER:

It’s late, Jack. Return to your
bed. I will come tuck you in in a
moment.
Jack won’t budge.
JACK FAWCETT
Mother, I love you.
JACK!

NINA FAWCETT
PLEASE!

The child finally lets go and leaves the room. She turns
back to Percy. A LONG BEAT. Then she moves to him, takes
his hand.
NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
I’ve not prepared myself for the
jungle, it is true...
They come together.

Softly, emotional:

HORSES, three DOGS. Fawcett leads and is ferocious, hacking
as if he were swatting bees, with a giant machete in one hand
and a map in the other. (Fawcett is looking slightly
native.)
PERCY FAWCETT

One hundred twenty-one miles until
Oviedo’s last marking!
Costin has stopped, is examining himself.
HENRY COSTIN
Damn these things...
Fawcett then looks down at Costin’s arm. He’s got MAGGOTS
eating his flesh. And an INFECTION which has begun in his
nostrils--ESPUNDIA. FAWCETT PAUSES.
HENRY COSTIN (CONT’D)
My nose now, too. Don’t YOU ever
get so much as a bee sting?
PERCY FAWCETT
(still to Costin; jokes)
Mr. Costin, do you not know I have
not my equal for virtue in the

Fawcett is immediately on the move again, slides down a muddy
path toward the RIVER. Way behind him: Murray is struggling.

PERCY FAWCETT
How are you managing?
JAMES MURRAY

Very well, Major! Acquiring many

getting quite heavy! Perhaps...I
ought to leave some of my
accoutrements behind!
PERCY FAWCETT
You don’t want to be ill-equipped
for the journey ahead! You’ll need
all you can carry!
JAMES MURRAY
Of course! I’m speaking merely of
my extra clothes! They’re slowing
me down a touch, that’s all! I’m
sure to be moving better if I might
lose them!
Fawcett looks back at Murray, who is lagging way behind:
PERCY FAWCETT
Very well--when we get to the

change of clothes and your
mattress!
HENRY COSTIN
Bugger probably wishes he were back

He stops somewhere near the middle, with the river around his

He wades directly INTO the fusillade of arrows. He repeats,
over and over, in Portuguese and other dialects:
Friend!

PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE)
Friend! Friend!

The arrows keep coming, FASTER THAN EVER. Several come
INCREDIBLY CLOSE, zooming right by his head. We can even
hear a ZIPPING SOUND. But Fawcett braves it nonetheless,
holding a SURVEYING BOOK in front of his face to protect it
from the arrows. THWACK! An ARROW HITS the SURVEYING BOOK,
in front of his face!
Fawcett stands there, a man between two sides of the river,
between two worlds maybe, and closes his eyes.
The water surrounds Fawcett’s armpits; no one moves.

Paddling out toward Fawcett in a raft, the GUARAYO takes the
handkerchief from Fawcett; Fawcett motions to be taken
across, and the two go to the Indian side with Fawcett
kneeling humbly on the flimsy float.
The whole group waits in silence for Fawcett, who disappears
into the forest.

attack, keep your eye on me! Rally

Fawcett emerges too, smiling.

He waves to his men.

Good God.
The group, including Murray, all venture across the river.

The men slowly approach the area. Human skulls abound. A
HUMAN BEING’S BODY is BEING COOKED on a SPIT. The troops are
spooked. Murray, in particular, seems appalled.
PERCY FAWCETT
I recognize a bit of the chief’s
language. It’s safe for us.
JAMES MURRAY
Are you mad?!? They’re cannibals!
PERCY FAWCETT
I recognize your reluctance and I
sympathize. But I’m asking you to
trust my experience--we must
attempt to engage.
JAMES MURRAY
(incredulous)
They’ve cooked a body, for
chrissakes! Have you gone insane?

PERCY FAWCETT
It’s a dead member of the tribe-his spirit will enter them if they
eat it. It’s their custom.
(to the whole group)
They may have critical information
about our destination.
JAMES MURRAY
(to the others)
They’ll kill us, these savages!
(to himself)
I refuse this madness. I refuse
it!
Manley, Costin, and the others look at Fawcett as though he
is insane as well. MURRAY STARTS TO BACK AWAY, toward the
FOREST.
Madness!

JAMES MURRAY (CONT’D)

Fawcett sees the others agree with Murray to a degree. He
doesn’t respond, and a brief look of madness, of possession,
flashes across his face. So instead he walks to:

INT. GUARAYOS TENT

The other men eventually, reluctantly follow Fawcett into the
tent--though conspicuously missing is MURRAY. Packed with
both our guys and the Guarayos now. A beat of silence, then,
to Costin:
PERCY FAWCETT
Can you give them something?
HENRY COSTIN
Yes--yes, of course.
Costin stupidly strikes a match, and though panicked, the
Indians calm quickly when Fawcett takes out a glittering
necklace:
PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE)
No--it’s a gift! A gift! For you.
And your--your son?
The Chief Guarayo, sitting next to a boy, gestures to him.
PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
Yes, wonderful... I have sons,
too.

The Chief smiles, points to Costin, Manley.

Fawcett laughs:

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
No no, my sons are far away.
CHIEF GUARAYO (SUBTITLE)
How can you be so far from them?
PERCY FAWCETT
(his smile disappears)
Our world is not like yours...
ANOTHER GUARAYO, A WOMAN, responds:
GUARAYO WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
All people are made of the same
clay.
The Chief takes a crushed BERRY COMPOUND and gestures to
FAWCETT around his EYES. FAWCETT COMPLIES, spreading the
DARK RED MIXTURE ON HIS FACE.
Then one of the GUARAYOS reaches for Costin’s ARM. At first,
Costin has trepidation, then allows the man to grab his
forearm.
THE GUARAYO WHISTLES LOUDLY, in a STRANGE PITCH. And the
MAGGOTS in Costin’s arm STAND UP. The Guarayo simply
squeezes gently and the maggots fall on the ground. Costin’s
arm is cured of the maggots--!
Costin TRIES TO WHISTLE like the GUARAYO but cannot:
PERCY FAWCETT
Not sure we have the touch.
(back to the Guarayo;

We’re looking for old houses, many
houses, many many people, deep into

The Guarayo speaks in his native tongue.

Then, to Costin:

He’s heard rumors, but is
uncertain. Further down the river,
he believes there’ll be others who
can help us.
Then another Guarayo motions to his mouth.

Food.

PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
Food--yes--thank you!

Lost City of Z

78.

ANGLE ON THE CHIEF as we GO TO:
65

EXT. RIVERBANK

65

A Guarayo crushes a plant with a stone and lets the juice
spill into the water. A milky cloud forms. After a moment,
DOZENS OF FISH RISE TO THE SURFACE, gasping. A Guarayo boy
wades into the water and pulls out the biggest. Fawcett, who
had been making his own face up with beads, bows his head in
thanks as he takes the fish.
Fawcett turns and looks at the water.
HENRY COSTIN
MY GOD! It’s only stunned them!
They don’t kill any more than they
have to! ‘S remarkable!
The other fish that the boy didn’t withdraw from the water
swim away.
66

EXT. GUARAYOS TENT - CLEARING

66

A thunderstorm is coming. Fawcett, with his makeup looking
native now, walks into the clearing, and in front of him he
sees that here are THOUSANDS of Indians living about. An
astonishing discovery. And they are not just savages. They
have advanced methods of farming; MAIZE GROWS AS FAR AS THE
EYE CAN SEE. Costin approaches:
HENRY COSTIN
We seem to have lost Mr. Murray.
PERCY FAWCETT
They’ve made the jungle into
farmland somehow. All the families
are working together--and there is
no rank or superiority among them.
It’s truly humbling.
Chief--

HENRY COSTIN

PERCY FAWCETT
Designed at right angles,
mathematical in its precision. It
confirms so much of what we
believed.
(to Costin)
Can you imagine what our lost city
must be like...?

Lost City of Z

79.

HENRY COSTIN
Chief, did you hear me about Mr.
Murray? Your great polar
explorer’s gone lost in the trees-PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Murray is an accomplished man-we’re not to fret over him. And
anyhow, he can’t have gone very
far. Tell the men I’ve designed
new rafts--the canoes are riddled
with arrows and useless now. We’ll
be off on foot in the morning...
Fawcett walks into the field of MAIZE. The wind blows the
plants, and Fawcett is an incongruous figure amidst the
Guarayos, who tend to the crops.
Costin watches as Fawcett approaches the LEADER OF THE
GUARAYOS and teaches him to HANDSHAKE. A GOODBYE OF SORTS...
CHIEF GUARAYO (SUBTITLE)
You may stay here with us. Join
your spirit to ours.
PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE)
(a beat; awe)
You honor me beyond words. But it
is not yet time for me to rest.
67

EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING

67

Murray is asleep on the ground. He has gotten lost. Strewn
nearby: his machete, all the photos of his family. Sitting
in the mud. Food eaten, the wrappings all over. Turkish
cigarette butts...
He awakens to see FAWCETT AND THE REST OF THE GROUP,
approaching him. Fawcett sees all the food’s been eaten. To
Murray, Fawcett must appear a strange figure--with his FACE
PAINT, now slightly streaked from the rain like tears...
JAMES MURRAY
Thank God you’ve found me--I--I got
lost. I didn’t think we’d survive
in the presence of those horrible
savages. My clothes and mouth-full of grit!
PERCY FAWCETT
You’ll be looked after. We must be
on our way now--

Lost City of Z

80.

BUT THEN: Fawcett reaches down, finds: AN EMPTY BOX OF
CARAMELS. INSIDE THE LID: “For your journey, darling, I love
you. Nina”. A FAWCETT FAMILY PHOTO IS INCLUDED.
Something changes in Fawcett.

DARKENS.

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
This...was from my wife and
children...
(beat)
For all of us.
JAMES MURRAY
Yes--I know--I was hungry! It was
supposed to be just a short rest.
The scrub’s incredibly dense and I
fell. I think I’ve a terrible
fever...
A BEAT. And then Fawcett looks like he is about to EXPLODE.
His EYES BULGE WITH RAGE:
Get up.

PERCY FAWCETT

Fawcett turns, ferociously hacks a branch with a machete.
JAMES MURRAY
Mr. Fawcett--just one more moment
of rest... I’m very tired-Fawcett FREEZES.

SPINS BACK AROUND.

Raging:

PERCY FAWCETT
You’re tired? You have no right to
be tired!
(beat)
My own sons--at their tender ages-could be counted on more than you.
I could be with them at this very
moment, yet I am here with YOU, to
attempt great things.
He collects himself, bends down again.

Privately:

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
You stole from the group and
violated our trust. I won’t have
this again.
JAMES MURRAY
(shocked)
How dare you speak to me that way!
Have you seen my leg? HAVE YOU?!?

Lost City of Z

81.

Fawcett looks down: Murray’s leg has a gash. Fawcett bends
down, looks at the wound. The other men surround Murray.
Murray’s things have scattered all over the jungle.
PERCY FAWCETT
It’s not yet infected, but if blood
poisoning should set in, you’ll be
a dead man.
(beat)
If you’d stayed with the group and
trusted the so-called savage, you’d
be fed--and cured. As it is, we’ve
got to hope for the best.
JAMES MURRAY
(at a loss for words)
Yes, well, I’ll, I’ll do that!
ANGLE ON MURRAY as FAWCETT walks away.
68

He is STEAMING.

EXT. THE RIVER

68

They are rafting. Dizzying. Murray is SHIVERING, VERY SICK,
a mess. Maggots have overwhelmed his legs. Fawcett and
Costin are maneuvering the raft.
BUMP! The rafts shift with the river’s flow. Murray and
Costin fall off the raft. Costin knows what to do; he starts
swimming to shore. Murray does not.
PERCY FAWCETT
Swim to shore! The water’s too
rough for piranhas!
Instead, Murray attempts to hold onto the raft and threatens
to capsize it.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
I said, swim to shore!
The raft starts to shift.

Fawcett is enraged:

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
God damn it!
(beat)
Let go! You pink-eyed weakling-LET GO!
The raft tips, and TWO CRATES OF SUPPLIES GO TUMBLING
OVERBOARD. Manley tries to stop them, to no avail...

Lost City of Z
69

82.

EXT. SHORE

69

Fawcett directs the raft to the shore using a bamboo pole.
The raft bumps up against the riverbank. Everyone has
congregated. All are out of breath. Fawcett eyes Murray
with utter contempt.
ARTHUR MANLEY
We’ve just lost a third of our
rations!
PERCY FAWCETT
(glaring at Murray)
Getting to the city and back was
already going to be difficult.
JAMES MURRAY
For heaven’s sake, I was drowning!
Didn’t you SEE?!?
PERCY FAWCETT
There was no chance of that! And
this after you took our food!
JAMES MURRAY
I suppose the honorable course of
action would be for me to starve,
then? Is that it? Is that what
you wish for? My death?!?
Fawcett, to Costin:
PERCY FAWCETT
Where are we now, do we know?
we behind our schedule?
Yes.

Are

HENRY COSTIN
We are--

JAMES MURRAY
You’re entirely without mercy! You
could at least slow down to give a
lame man a chance for his life!
Still not paying attention to Murray, Fawcett remains fixed
on Costin. Seeing a couple of ABANDONED HUTS behind Costin:
PERCY FAWCETT
Pitch camp here for the night,
we’ll determine our progress.
JAMES MURRAY
And now you ignore me!

Lost City of Z

83.

EXT. CAMP - DUSK

70

One of the HORSES starts to collapse. Looks very ill.
CREWMEMBER turns to the others, shouting:

A

CREWMEMBER
Horse down!
The Crewmember takes out his gun, SHOOTS THE HORSE.
ACROSS THE FIRE:
Murray has a fever. Truly sick: swollen, distended, in
terrible shape--covered with maggots. A colorful snake hangs
from a tree over his head. He moans over and over,
shivering. To a noncomprehending Indian, he gets delirious:
JAMES MURRAY
I’m going to die too, just like
that horse. I’m a man of
property...now worth as much as
that horse...
SEEING THE MAGGOTS, TEARS COME TO MURRAY’S EYES.
SICK, DYING, DELIRIOUS:

COMPLETELY

JAMES MURRAY (CONT’D)
The affrontery of this upstart, and
his vulgar quest for glory... Like
a Judas...delivering me over to
this jungle when he handed over our
Lord, to be crucified... Father,
forgive me this trespasses,
As we forgive them that trespass
against us... But...but let me not
compare myself to thee, my Lord.
You have delivered me from other
evils, Lord. The fierce cold in
Antarctica, was I weak then?
(strained smile through
tears)
He is not even worthy to kiss the
hem of my garment, Lord. Even as I
am not worthy to touch yours...
Give me strength to survive, to
forgive this man his sins against
me...
SEVERAL YARDS AWAY
Costin comes over to Fawcett, who is standing near the fire.
Pondering...something. Manley is here, too.

Lost City of Z

84.

HENRY COSTIN
We’re about two weeks behind our
planned pace. That’s my best
guess, from the sextant and the
charts.
In the background, James Murray lets out a MOAN.
ARTHUR MANLEY
It appears our Mr. Murray’s got
blood poisoning now.
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes... I’d noticed that.
(beat)
So much for his good bloodline.
HENRY COSTIN
I caught him with our maize
yesterday morning. He claimed it
was from his own private store.
Fawcett moves closer.

Sotto voce, looking at Murray:

PERCY FAWCETT
I fooled myself for some time, but
no longer--the man is a cancer. If
we keep him with us we won’t
survive, much less reach the city
and return to our families.
HENRY COSTIN
I say we ditch him, leave him to
rot. I’ve wanted to from the
beginning. His Lordship’s a coward
and a thief.
ARTHUR MANLEY
I’m in agreement, Major--there
aren’t two sets of rules, one for
the high and one for the low.
HENRY COSTIN
What’s it going to be, Chief?
Fawcett eyes Murray.
MOMENTS LATER
PERCY APPROACHES MURRAY, around whom flies swarm.
eyes Fawcett suspiciously:

Murray

Lost City of Z

85.

JAMES MURRAY
What is it...?
Fawcett speaks deliberately, almost as if proving a case in a
courtroom. In measured and careful tones, like a speech he
has prepared:
PERCY FAWCETT
When traveling in the jungle
without other resources, every man
must realize that if he falls sick
and cannot move with the others
that there must be consequences.
The others cannot wait and die with
him.
(beat)
Do you understand?
Murray seems to get it.
to grip his revolver.

An awkward beat, then: Murray starts

JAMES MURRAY
You’re only here--all of you-because of the funds I provided!
Costin whips his shotgun out, points it directly at Murray.
Pushes the shotgun up against his cheek. A tense moment.
PERCY FAWCETT
Many of us have families back home.
And I cannot allow you to further
jeopardize the welfare of our
entire party.
(to Costin)
Mr. Costin.
As Costin takes Murray’s revolver from him:
JAMES MURRAY
You don’t care one whit about me or
the rest of our party, Mr. Fawcett.
You don’t even care about returning
home--you only care about finding
your bloody city!
PERCY FAWCETT
There are some in our group that
would have me abandon you here and
leave you to die. But I will not.
There are mining encampments south
of us, along the river. In the
morning you’ll be on your way to
them.
(MORE)

Lost City of Z

86.

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT'D)
I’ll give you our last horse with
what supplies we can spare and an
Indian to guide you.
JAMES MURRAY
You’ll pack me off with a bloody
swamp wog, will you?
(beat)
This calm willingness to abandon me
is a queer thing to hear from an
Englishman. But it does not
surprise me, as I have now
sufficiently gauged your class and
character.
71

EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING

71

Murray is placed atop a mule. Manley and Costin have trained
their guns on him. Fawcett notices MURRAY’S INFECTED KNEE.
PERCY FAWCETT
Godspeed, Mr. Murray-JAMES MURRAY
(interrupting, with rage)
Let’s hope our paths don’t ever
cross again, Mr. Fawcett. For your
sake.
With that, Murray rides off. Fawcett and the others watch as
the mule disappears into the jungle.
HENRY COSTIN
Good riddance, I say.
ARTHUR MANLEY
Any chance for him, Chief?
PERCY FAWCETT
Slim, to be sure. But it’s the
best we could do...
(beat)
Let us go.
72

EXT. CANYON - DUSK

72

Fawcett leads the men as they slide down a steep canyon.
RAIN comes.

The

LIGHTNING.

THE RUMBLE OF THUNDER.

Lost City of Z

87.

Fawcett looks up, through heavy downpour: SEES what he thinks
is a MASSIVE STONE FACE CARVED INTO THE WALL OF THE CANYON.
A GODLIKE VISION.
Then, A ROAR. The “STONE FACE” CARVED INTO THE WALL OF THE
CANYON seems to CRUMBLE AMIDST THE DOWNPOUR...
Fawcett SEEMS in a TRANCE when-Chief!

HENRY COSTIN

PERCY FAWCETT
Yes, I saw it! We’re close now!
The men are SOAKED. FROZEN.
READY TO KEEP MOVING:

PANTING.

FAWCETT, HOWEVER, IS

HENRY COSTIN
All our reserves are lost!
The CAMERA TILTS DOWN. Costin and the others have flung over
the rations CRATES. INSIDE, the rations are COVERED with
OIL. Ruined:
HENRY COSTIN (CONT’D)
They’re covered in paraffin! The
bloody bastard destroyed them!
(beat)
We’ve got to head back!
PERCY FAWCETT
We can’t! We’ve nothing to show
for our efforts--no evidence-HENRY COSTIN
MAJOR! With what little we’ve got
on our backs, death would be
certain within days! If we’d still
had the horse you gave Murray and
all it could carry, we might have a
fighting chance!
Fawcett ponders.

Through gritted teeth and deep rage:

PERCY FAWCETT
God damn me for a fool to bring
him!
Then: he bashes the side of a rock repeatedly with his
machete. Pure frustration over the whole situation.
Over
this, we HEAR:

Lost City of Z

88.

PERCY FAWCETT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
To be sent to the R.G.S.: Mr.
James Murray was forced to separate
from our expedition to seek medical
attention. His location is
currently unknown, and he has most
likely perished.
73

INT. LA PAZ - BRITISH EMBASSY - DAY

73

Fawcett has arrived in La Paz, Bolivia, to the British
Embassy. He is writing on a notepad a message to the RGS,
which an English Officer is typing:
PERCY FAWCETT (V.O.)
The British Minister has his case
in hand and his family should not
be contacted unless there is
definitive news of some kind. The
rest of the group shall arrive back
in England as soon as is
possible...
Fawcett looks at the counter. CLOSE SHOT ON a newspaper.
The headline, in Spanish, is all about the ASSASSINATION OF
THE ARCHDUKE FERDINAND and WAR IN EUROPE. The ENGLISH
OFFICER sees Percy looking at the paper. In a jolly tone:
ENGLISH OFFICER
(grinning)
Looks like a war with Fritz! We’d
better all get home or we’ll miss
our chance to fight!
PERCY FAWCETT
(eyes him; then, re
telegram)
Please send this immediately.
Yes, sir.

ENGLISH OFFICER

WE SEE PERCY WALK OUT OF THE OUTLET into the distance...
75

EXT. OUTSIDE THE FAWCETT HOME - LATE DAY, SUNNY

75

It’s quiet, punctuated only by the sounds of boys playing in
the distance: Fawcett’s sons play with a rugby ball.
CLOSE SHOT on a BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL, ALMOST A TODDLER,
sitting on the ground surrounded by blocks. We HEAR:

Lost City of Z

89.

NINA FAWCETT (O.S.)
That is Joan, as you might have
guessed.
Widen to SEE FAWCETT and NINA in the backyard of the house,
eyeing their daughter. Nina has a BROAD SMILE.
PERCY FAWCETT
Beautiful name. For a beautiful
child.
(to the toddler)
Joan, I’m your father.
SHE SMILES AT HIM, POKES HIS FACE.

An instant connection.

NINA FAWCETT
I’ll go and get the boys--they’re
playing a fierce match-PERCY FAWCETT
No no. Let them finish.
for them...

It’s good

NINA FAWCETT
(beat)
There are many urgent telegrams
waiting for you, inside.
Fawcett nods.
NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Perhaps it’s about the war, on the
continent-PERCY FAWCETT
(interrupting her)
It’s not. It’s about my mission.
I’ll need to go to London soon, no
doubt. There will be a reckoning.
He steps forward, watches his boys play in the distance.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
I came close, Cheeky. I had to
turn back, for the good of the men.
(fighting tears)
I face humiliation now... I did
everything I could and I
accomplished nothing.
Her face contorts: ANGRY, she stands over him but remains
outwardly calm:

Lost City of Z

90.

NINA FAWCETT
If you have accomplished nothing,
then what does that say about us?
That all our efforts on behalf of
this family have been for naught?
Our willingness to live in
something less than splendor will
not be in vain.
Fawcett turns back to face Nina; starts to walk to the house.
PERCY FAWCETT
When the boys are done with their
game, send them in and I’ll tell
them what’s happened.
Fawcett walks into the house. Looking around, he disappears-but we still see his SHADOW. He buries his head in his
hands.
76

EXT. ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY - NEW BUILDING - DAY

76

A magnificent structure.
77

INT. ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY - HALLWAY

77

Fawcett walks down the hall and, looking lost, he enters:
78

INT. MAP ROOM

78

An elegant space. FAWCETT EYES THE ROOM. Packed, with Sir
George Goldie, Sir John Scott Keltie, and the rest of the RGS
gang we know--including Manley and Costin and William Barclay
among the roughly twenty in attendance.
Major.

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
You know many of us here.

Then a seated man with his back to us turns:
JAMES MURRAY. Fawcett spots him, then moves to a seat; a
trial-like atmosphere in the room, tense. A silent beat,
then:
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE (CONT’D)
Mr. James Murray has arrived in
London just this morning.
Fawcett eyes Murray without a HINT of what has gone on
between them. If anything, he seems calm, with the trace of
a smile on his face:

Lost City of Z
PERCY FAWCETT
I would like to congratulate you.
On your safe return.
(beat)
A remarkable effort.
No answer by Murray.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
Mr. Murray contends that you
abandoned him.
(beat)
Is this true?
PERCY FAWCETT
No, it is not. He was sent back
with both food and money. It was a
necessary maneuver, in order to
save lives.
JAMES MURRAY
He also tried to kill me, Sir
George. Ask him about THAT-PERCY FAWCETT
That’s absurd. We almost killed
ourselves giving you what rations
we could!
JAMES MURRAY
Sir John, we spent all our time
playing around in the mud with
savages. And may I say, I never
saw any evidence of a lost city,
either.
PERCY FAWCETT
Mr. Murray, you were the reason we
did not reach our destination!
HENRY COSTIN
(to Percy)
Tell them--our rations were covered
with paraffin!
JAMES MURRAY
I reject that accusation-PERCY FAWCETT
(to the room)
You may ask Mr. Manley here--or ANY
of the other members of my team--if
you have doubt of it.

91.

Lost City of Z

92.

SIR GEORGE GOLDIE, who has been listening this whole time,
STARES AT PERCY. Looks almost DISAPPOINTED in him.
JAMES MURRAY
Sir John, I will not tolerate any
further insult from this young man!
I have retained counsel and will
proceed accordingly. And as for
his lackeys--they’re swine, as
untrustworthy as their master!
HENRY COSTIN
(to Percy)
It is out of respect for you that I
do not beat him like the dog he is.
Costin STANDS. Goldie speaks up, looking utterly
heartbroken, near tears:
SIR GEORGE GOLDIE
Please. Sit down.
(Costin does so; then)
Gentlemen, our nation is now at
war, and it ill becomes us to hold
onto private conflicts. I
earnestly beseech you to come to an
understanding.
A beat.

Then:
JAMES MURRAY
Well... I will...very generously
offer that if Mr. Fawcett were
willing to apologize--here, in the
company of the entire society,
then...I might be inclined to drop
my claims against him and the RGS.
(beat)
With certain conditions, of course.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
What about it, Percy? Will you
apologize?
PERCY FAWCETT
For the general good, I am willing
to reconcile. However, I should
like to hear Mr. Murray’s
conditions.

Lost City of Z
JAMES MURRAY
On the night I agreed to join you-and allowed your star to enter my
sphere--your wife was there to
witness your ascent. My condition-my sole condition--is that she once
again be present. On this occasion
she will witness your
acknowledgement of the wrongs you
have done me.
Fawcett stews, contemplating a response in front of the
enormous--and uncharacteristically quiet--group. Then:
PERCY FAWCETT
When I last saw you, Mr. Murray, I
was putting you on our only
remaining horse and giving you more
than your share of our food. The
rest of my men urged me to leave
you where you lay, but I could not
bring myself to do so. And as a
consequence I saved your life.
JAMES MURRAY
Saved my life, did you?!? You left
me to die! Yet by my own
expertise, which you despise, I was
able to escape the hell to which
you had abandoned me! And I now
confound your hopes to bury your
shame in that filthy jungle!
(to Keltie)
Mr. Secretary--I demand that
apology!
PERCY FAWCETT
I should apologize.
(looks to Costin, Manley)
To my crew. I’m sorry that I ever
believed Mr. Murray to be worthy of
your company. And that I ever
mistook a man’s rank for his
mettle. I shall not make that
mistake again.
Yes.

Fawcett stands, walks toward the door.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Sir John, what your purpose can be
in this ambush I cannot say. But
you need fear no more embarrassment
from me.

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
I hereby resign myself from this
institution. And I shall proceed
on my own. Good day.
MURRAY SMILES JUST A BIT as he says:
JAMES MURRAY
Mr. Fawcett, no man is an island
unto himself--a fact you shall soon
discover to your deep regret! I
shall teach you what it means to
challenge your betters!

EXT. FAWCETT HOME - NIGHT

Fawcett gets out of a Hansom Cab.
80

INT. FAWCETT HOME - FOYER - NIGHT
Fawcett enters. Nina’s been in the kitchen, extinguishing
the oil lamps. She looks toward the door, looking grave.
She and Percy exchange looks. Something is amiss:
PERCY FAWCETT
What’s going on?
(beat)
WHAT’S WRONG?
NINA FAWCETT
You’ve received a letter. All
former officers not currently
posted must send their names to the
War Office.
(beat)
I suppose it’s best we try and find
your uniform.
She goes back to extinguishing the lamps.
NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
(upset, trying not to be)
Let us hope it’s a brief conflict.
PERCY FAWCETT
Don’t be concerned, Cheeky. I’ve
spent a whole life training for
this. Besides, the jungle has
never harmed me--a little war
cannot beat that challenge.
He walks up the stairs.

Fawcett comes up the stairs, sees BRIAN AND JACK, at their
desks from the hall. Presumably doing homework. Jack is now
almost a young teen now and Brian a boy. Fawcett stands near
the doorway, looking at them. SMILES.

BRIAN FAWCETT

PERCY FAWCETT
(shocked; darkens)
How dare you talk to me in such a
manner?
JACK FAWCETT
How dare you, Father? You do not
think of us. You think of Indians
or Germans, or any other path to
glory that you can find.
NINA FAWCETT
(appalled)
JACK! You must stop it at ONCE!
JACK FAWCETT
Mother, I will NOT STOP! He’s
returned a failure. ALL the papers
are full of it! And now he wants
to abandon us again! It is
contemptible!
Percy EXPLODES. He LUNGES ACROSS THE ROOM and SLAPS THE BOY
with tremendous and frightening ferocity.
BRIAN FAWCETT
(bursting into tears)
Father!
Brian COVERS HIS EYES, deeply distraught. Nina steps forward
to defend Percy, who, though furious, steps back--eyes
widened, still in a dazed fit of anger.
NINA FAWCETT
Everything your father has done,
since the day you came into this
world, has been to better your
life, and that of your brother and
sister. For your own sake, I hope
the day will come when you regret
the things you have said to him.
Jack’s FACE is buried in his pillow:
JACK FAWCETT
I hate him, Mother! I hope he
never comes back!
Percy exits the room. We PAN off this image to the WALL of

A MACHINE GUN on a battle-scarred scene. Total devastation.
We PAN past a field scorched by destruction, as far as the
eye can see. No vegetation at all. The area is EERILY
QUIET, only occasionally punctuated by a RAT-A-TAT-TAT or a
distant explosion. We SEE a TRENCH LINE.
SUPERIMPOSE: “THE FRONT, RIVER SOMME, FRANCE. TWO YEARS
LATER”.
83

INT. TRENCH

The trench itself is filled with weary and shattered troops,
and rotting corpses. Blood and fumes. Urine and shit and
bones and lice and maggots and rats. A dead man has drowned
in the slime, only part of his head exposed. HELL ON EARTH.

INT. BUNKER - FAWCETT’S SPACE

A table, a phone, a lantern, not much else. Dark corners.
There’s someone in the corner, in that darkness. Manley is
here, in uniform. He is reading a letter with a NEWSPAPER
CLIPPING. He LAUGHS.
ARTHUR MANLEY
(amazed)
Well what do you know! It appears
our old friend Mr. James Murray
isn’t so powerful after all!
PERCY FAWCETT’S VOICE
What’s that, Mr. Manley?
ARTHUR MANLEY
He and his bloody cronies may have
put us in this hellhole, but his
latest expedition seems to have
come a cropper.
PERCY FAWCETT’S VOICE
Please give me the details.
Manley approaches the dark corner, holding the CLIPPING and
putting it in Fawcett’s face (presumably). As he does so:
ARTHUR MANLEY
Bastard went off on an arctic
expedition with Canadians and
mutinied--he’s not been heard from
since!

Lost City of Z

98.

ANGLE ON THE DARKNESS. We SEE an ARM REACH UP, out of the
dark, and turn up the LANTERN. The LIGHT REVEALS only PART
OF FAWCETT’S SHOULDER, SURROUNDED BY LARGE DRAWINGS OF THE
AMAZONIAN JUNGLE, FAMILY PHOTOS, ETC. An elaborate shrine.
MANLEY IS LAUGHING.
Fawcett enters the light, and it looks like he’s aged a
THOUSAND YEARS. LOOKING DOWN AT THE MURRAY NEWSPAPER
CLIPPING:
PERCY FAWCETT
Someone should warn the eskimos
that Mr. Murray is on the prowl...
THEY LAUGH.
CUT TO:
85

EXT. TRENCH - LATER

A young man RUNS from atop the trench, JUMPING DOWN into the
trench. He runs toward the small bunker and ENTERS:
86

INT. BUNKER - FAWCETT’S SPACE

86

Where Fawcett is in the midst of writing at his desk and
Manley is reading. The TRENCH RUNNER announces himself:
TRENCH RUNNER
Sir! A message, from Colonel
Howard!
Fawcett READS THE NOTE.

A beat.

Then:

PERCY FAWCETT
Thank you, Private.
The Private salutes.

Leaves.

Percy looks unsettled.

ARTHUR MANLEY
What is it, Chief?
PERCY FAWCETT
(very grave)
There’s movement in the German
position. Perhaps preparing for
some kind of attack.
(with disgust)
We may be asked to withdraw...

Lost City of Z

99.

He gets up, looks through the periscope to SEE: MOVEMENT
AMONG THE GERMAN TROOPS. THEY ARE PREPARING THEIR GUNS.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
How many men are at our command at
present?
ARTHUR MANLEY
Seven hundred, sir. And the two
Indian brigades on horseback.
PERCY FAWCETT
Gather up as many men as you can.
Cooks and signallers as well.
We’ll go over the top at dawn.
ARTHUR MANLEY
Chief, if plans are being made to
withdraw-PERCY FAWCETT
Those plans are absurd. We might
all die if the Germans attack. Is
that what you prefer?
(beat)
There can be no retirement--our
backs are against the wall.
Prepare to go over the top. Any
man who has not written to his
loved ones should do so.
ARTHUR MANLEY
(humbled)
Yes, Chief.
Manley turns away, to carry out the orders.
87

EXT. TRENCH - OUTSIDE THE BUNKER - JUST BEFORE DAWN

87

Fires illuminate the space. Fawcett checks his watch, then
walks through the trench, passing frightened soldiers. Then
toward the bunker, where he hears a CHEERFUL COMMOTION.
88

INT. BUNKER
HE ENTERS THE BUNKER, where his AMAZON ARTWORK is all over
the walls. The troops--about twenty--sit around a table,
packed into the cavernous room. Seated at the table is
MADAME KUMEL, a mystic. The soldiers see Fawcett; HENRY
COSTIN is here! Costin shouts out:

88

Lost City of Z

100.

HENRY COSTIN
Won’t you join us, sir! We’re
having a mysticism--a medium of
fine spiritualist skills!
Costin approaches:
HENRY COSTIN (CONT’D)
(sotto)
She’ll bless us for the fight with
Fritz. With a bit of the occult-part of the world that isn’t right
in front of our face, if you know
what I mean.
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes... I surely do.
(to the Madame)
We’ll be in battle soon, madame.
Any spiritual aid we can get--I
think we’d all very much like your
blessing.
HENRY COSTIN
Madame, how ‘bout you read the
Major?
The whole group CHEERS the idea. Madame Kumel motions for
Fawcett to sit down. Fawcett sits and the men CHEER WILDLY.
Manley ENTERS the BUNKER.
MADAME KUMEL
(the men told her)
You are the explorer?
PERCY FAWCETT
I am. As are these fine men, who
have transferred here, to be with
me.
Points to Costin and Manley, who cheer. She reaches over,
takes an Indian NECKLACE that Fawcett has wrapped around his
hand like a bracelet. She slips it off.
She looks up at the WALL, SEES THE JUNGLE ARTWORK. She
begins to HYPNOTIZE THE ROOM. She holds the object and with
her other hand holds Fawcett’s:
MADAME KUMEL
Feel my hand... Listen to my
voice. Only my voice... Only my
voice. Empty your mind, the only
thing is my voice...

Lost City of Z

101.

Fawcett stares at the mesmerizing Madame.
MADAME KUMEL (CONT’D)
You have loved ones at home?
I do...

PERCY FAWCETT
My wife, and children...

MADAME KUMEL
But you are not home. Can you take
me where you are...?
(beat)
Can you take me to where you dream
to be?
PERCY FAWCETT
It is far away...
MADAME KUMEL
Is it the forest?
(beat)
You wish to be in the forest?
PERCY FAWCETT
I wish to find a lost city...
MADAME KUMEL
Can you see yourself there, now...?
Try to picture it, in your mind.
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes. I can. I can see it, in the
jungle. My family is with me.
89

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

89

We SEE Kumel and Fawcett, at the table--which is now situated
in the middle of the jungle. NINA and THE CHILDREN are
SEATED AROUND HIM--JACK’S BACK is to US.
We still HEAR ONLY the SOUND FROM THE BUNKER and the sounds
of the WAR. KUMEL CONTINUES:
MADAME KUMEL
Your place is beyond the jungle
city. A timeless place.
90

EXT. RUINS
We are in what looks like a more extensive Machu Picchu.
There are GOLD STATUES, ENORMOUS, everywhere.

90

Lost City of Z

102.

Still, we HEAR ONLY THE SOUND FROM THAT BUNKER. And yes, now
Kumel and Fawcett are around the table in the middle of the
ruins:
MADAME KUMEL
I see a valley... A valley and a
great city, full of jewels.
(beat)
A wealth of real jewels and gold.
But also jewels of the spirit...
THE EXPLOSIONS GET LOUDER. AND LOUDER. THEN, a BEAUTIFUL
RAIN OF FLAKES OF GOLD COMES DOWN, NOT TOUCHING OUR
PROTAGONISTS BUT SEEMINGLY COVERING THE GROUND LIKE SNOW...
Kumel continues:
MADAME KUMEL (CONT’D)
Your soul is not quiet. You must
find this new world. It is your
destiny. You seek escape from our
world, escape from its cruelties
and customs...
CUT TO:
91

FAWCETT IN THE JUNGLE
Seated, by himself.

91

The CAMERA DOLLIES IN, SLOWLY:

PERCY FAWCETT (V.O.)
Our world has set itself
afire...and we must look elsewhere
to quench the blaze...
ALL OF A SUDDEN, A DEAFENING EXPLOSION SHATTERS THE MOMENT
and we are BACK IN:
92

INT. THE BUNKER

92

Which has been hit by a shell. The men all scatter, in
panicked chaos... Fawcett covers his head from the falling
debris... A close call... The rain of gold flakes was
actually falling dirt... Fawcett exits the bunker, into:
93

EXT. TRENCH - JUST BEFORE DAWN

93

The troops, looking weary and beyond battle-scarred, stare at
CAMERA as we DOLLY PAST THEM. They cower from the shells.
We’re in Fawcett’s POV. FAWCETT PATROLS THE TRENCH.

Lost City of Z

103.

Fawcett then looks over to SEE a LOW PRIVATE, shaking like a
leaf. The Private has vomited all over his uniform. Fawcett
then charges through the trench, YELLING HIS SPEECH:
PERCY FAWCETT
When I was younger, I ventured all
for King and Country, for place,
and rank. I believed that to be
the makings of a man. But my
travels have taught me that such
ambitions are mere phantoms.
Phantoms that exclude humanity from
the Garden of Eden. My dear
friends, what DOES matter--the only
thing that matters--is the esteem
we show our fellow man. In our
hearts we fight for our loved ones;
as they are not here today, we
fight for each other.
(beat)
Good luck and may God be with you.
HENRY COSTIN
And fuck the bloody Boche!
Everyone laughs, including Fawcett.
Then the men separate, begin to line the trenches. Cleaning
their rifles, making sure the bayonets are screwed on
tightly. Readying the charge. Many men start throwing up;
others kiss small bibles; others look at family photos which
they kiss and place in their breastpockets. Others are
merely still, awaiting almost certain death. Fawcett takes a
small drawing of AMAZONIA JUNGLE, holds it to his head.
Almost like he’s praying to it. Then pockets it.
We SEE: ROWS OF HORSES, getting GAS MASKS put on their heads.
INDIAN TROOPS are getting ready to mount them, and are
adorned in the most elaborate and absurd manner...
94

EXT. TRENCH - BATTLEFIELD - DAY
Fawcett takes several steps near the top of the trench.
Places a whistle in his mouth. Looks at his men, who are
donning GAS MASKS. Raises his arm and BLOWS THE WHISTLE.
Upon blowing the whistle, an army of men charge out of the
trench with a collective BATTLE CRY. Among them, the Low
Private. ALMOST INSTANTLY, so many of the men are RIDDLED
WITH MACHINE GUN FIRE. Others are SET AFIRE with
FLAMETHROWERS.

94

Lost City of Z

104.

EXPLOSIONS ALL AROUND. Mines. Shells. Brutally loud.
THEN: THE TWO INDIAN CAVALRY REGIMENTS GALLOP out of the
TRENCHES; the HORSES HAVE GAS MASKS OF THEIR OWN. Absurd.
They charge toward the German position, but are SET ON FIRE
by FLAMETHROWERS and HIT BY THE HAIL OF BULLETS. Huge
numbers of new troops leap from the trenches, many to be met
with a similar fate.
Wounded infantrymen crawl into shell holes. Fawcett himself
emerges from the trench. Sees ARTHUR MANLEY, shrieking.
Then MANLEY gets his FACE BLOWN OFF. Costin charges right
along with Fawcett.
Fawcett whips off the gas mask and starts to yell. Screams
to his soldiers, often inaudible from the devastating sounds
of war, we can nonetheless tell what he’s saying either by
reading his lips or by the occasional word peaking through:
Come on!

PERCY FAWCETT
Come on! Come on!
FLASH CUT TO:

95

FAWCETT, URGING ON FELLOW EXPLORERS IN THE JUNGLE; HIS MOTION
95
IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS THE ONE ON THE BATTLEFIELD...
CUT BACK TO:

96

EXT. BATTLEFIELD

96

A GONG sound. CHEMICAL WEAPONS are coming.
SCREAMS FROM HIS POSITION:
Incoming!

HENRY COSTIN

HENRY COSTIN
Gas!

Fawcett stands in the middle of the battlefield, seemingly a
man on his own. And in his own world. Men shrink and charge
forward around him; men die around him; men courageously
stand their ground.
BULLETS and FLAMES seem mysteriously to avoid him; he seems
impervious... SMOKE seems to envelop Fawcett in his crazed,
dazed state. He holds up his rifle with its bayonet into the
air. He has a THOUSAND-YARD STARE NOW...
AND THEN WE HEAR IT: A GONG SOUND. A nearby explosion.
Fawcett falls to his knees. His mouth opens in lockjaw and
his eyes roll back into his head. He falls...

Lost City of Z

105.

WE PAN OFF HIM TO REVEAL: bits of letters and photos that the
men carry into battle flutter over the corpses like snow. The
CAMERA MOVES through the battlefield, littered with the
papers and blood and parts of bodies.
The camera settles, finally, on a piece of BARBED WIRE.
Attached to it: the DRAWING BY FAWCETT of AMAZONIA. Stained
with blood, moving gently in the wind...
97

INT. MILITARY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY

97

Fawcett, in the hospital. In bed, somewhere in England. He
awakens, dazed, shocked--by the EYE PATCHES which cover his
eyes. NINA FAWCETT is here, with the three children behind
her. She approaches the bedside as he moves. She TEARS UP.
Fighting the tears, she smiles, puts on a brave face:
NINA FAWCETT
Darling, it is I. We’re here--the
children are here.
The children walk to Fawcett’s side, all muttering “HELLO”.
Jack is now a young adult; Brian, a young teen; and young
daughter JOAN a toddler.
PERCY FAWCETT
Let me kiss you all.
Nina lifts the toddler Joan, and Fawcett kisses her.
strokes the top of Brian’s head tenderly.

Fawcett

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
Joan, and Brian...where’s Jack?
JACK FAWCETT
Here, father.
Jack steps forward, CRYING.

Then to Nina:

PERCY FAWCETT
What’s...happened to me...?
NINA FAWCETT
They say you’ve been exposed to
chlorine gas. Your eyes were
affected, but with any luck, your
sight shall return. And--you’re
here, darling. You’re with us, and
that is what matters.
Fawcett lifts his head a bit, straining for sensation.
DOCTOR is here, too.

A

Lost City of Z

106.

PERCY FAWCETT
What about Costin? The rest of the
men?
NINA FAWCETT
Mr. Costin was unhurt. As for your
division, they suffered many losses-but far fewer than others. It is
the most death in the history of
any battle.
(beat)
But darling, because of your
bravery, the Germans have
retreated, all along the front.
We’ve made His Majesty aware of
what you’ve done.
And they’re going to award you with
the distinguished service order.
They’ve also agreed to raise your
rank to Lieutenant Colonel.
Jack cannot help himself, but, appalled, he blurts out:
JACK FAWCETT
Lieutenant Colonel? After all he’s
done?!?
NINA FAWCETT
(not now)
Jack...
The young man, still in tears, takes several steps backward
and sits on a bench.
NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
We’ll bring you home as soon as
we’re able, darling.
PERCY FAWCETT
(beat)
What about--what about my travels?
To Amazonia?
Nina cannot answer this.

She looks to the Doctor:

DOCTOR
I...I’m afraid you may never be
able to return to your jungle.
Percy Fawcett shuts his eyes in quiet disappointment and
turns away. The Doctor attempts to cheer him:

Lost City of Z

107.

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
However, you can take comfort in
the fact that here we’ll be able to
offer you the very best care in all
the civilized world.
Fawcett turns back to the Doctor when he hears this:
PERCY FAWCETT
“Civilized”? That word is an
obscenity. I’ve been years in that
jungle, with so-called savages.
And none would ever bring such
horror and destruction on his
fellow creatures.
Percy turns away. Everyone takes the hint--Nina pats
everyone out. But staying is JACK. Jack sits down in a
chair against the wall.
NINA TURNS to OBSERVE:
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
(sotto voce)
Jack...?
Jack approaches his father’s bedside. Without being able to
make eye contact, Fawcett somehow finds his son’s FACE. He
TOUCHES it, FEELING ITS CONTOURS--then touching the young
man’s tear...

you’ve been since the war. America
has quite a fascination with you.

Nina

Lost City of Z

PERCY FAWCETT
I’m grateful for their interest.
You may tell your readers I’ve
recovered from my wounds and have
adapted to home life. The family’s
lived in many places--Jamaica, also
in America, briefly. We’ve only
just returned to England.
NINA FAWCETT
It’s been quite wonderful to have
him with us for this time.
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes--my family’s needs are above
all now.
AMERICAN MAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
But your pursuits in South America
led to tremendous interest in
exploration in the United States.
There have been many new voyages
planned.
Percy Fawcett perks up.

NEW voyages?

PERCY FAWCETT
Have there...?
AMERICAN MAN’S VOICE (O.C
Well, Dr. Hamilton Rice is headed
to Brazil soon...with radio, and
airplanes.
Fawcett gets up, walks over to a large MAP of South America.
He stares at it. ANGLE ON FAWCETT still looking at that map:
AMERICAN MAN’S VOICE (O.C. (CONT’D)
He’s taking a large and very wellarmed party.
PERCY FAWCETT
We can only hope that--with all of
his arms, Dr. Rice doesn’t destroy
what he wishes to discover...
(turns back to the
reporter)
Tell me, how did you find us here?
AMERICAN MAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
(surprised)
Your son, Colonel. He wrote us a
letter--didn’t he tell you?

ANGLE ON FAWCETT as we GO TO:
100

EXT. LARGE FIELD - CLOUDY DAY

100

We HEAR distant GUN SHOTS. The wind howls. Then we SEE,
emerging from over a hill, Jack Fawcett, holding a RIFLE. A
RABBIT runs through the grass. Jack raises his rifle, FIRES
again. He hits the RABBIT. Percy and Nina Fawcett emerge,
having seen the shot.
PERCY FAWCETT
You’ve become quite expert with
that rifle!
JACK FAWCETT
Thank you, father.
After he recovers, he WATCHES HIS SON RUN to GET THE RABBIT.
JACK PROUDLY HOLDS UP THE CARCASS. Father stares at son,
something on his mind. Then, re the rabbit:
PERCY FAWCETT
No no, I’ll retrieve it...
As Percy goes to get the animal, Nina has a private moment
with Jack:
NINA FAWCETT
I know you feel remorse about the
harsh words you said to him. But
that was years ago. He loves you.
Go talk with him.

101

EXT. TOP OF A HILL - LATER

101

The RABBIT hangs from a tree. Fawcett and Jack are settled
here, atop a hill, overlooking the field. Fawcett stands,
lighting a small cigar; Jack sits, cleaning his gun.
Fawcett PETS THE HANGING CARCASS of the rabbit, then lowers
it from the string and begins to prep it for eating.
Father...?
Mmm?

JACK FAWCETT (CONT'D)
When we came back to England, I saw
how few of my friends still had

It’s been a difficult few years for
many.

You’ve been writing to the American
newspapers about us, I’m told.
JACK FAWCETT
I have. I’ve been reading of your
exploits. They are quite
extraordinary.
Beat.
PERCY FAWCETT
I’ve something for you.
Fawcett pulls something out of his bag: AN INDIAN NECKLACE.
He gives it to Jack:
PERCY FAWCETT (O.C.) (CONT’D)
It was from a Guarani Indian. It’s
yours now.
JACK FAWCETT
Thank you... It’s remarkable...
(beat)
The Americans are going to Amazonia
now. I’m sickened by the thought
that they might steal your thunder.
PERCY FAWCETT
(a broad smile)
I’ve little enough thunder to
steal, my boy. I never did find Z.
JACK FAWCETT
You must not say that! I’ve read
of your achievements--you are a
great man! You still believe in Z,
do you not? That we have always
underestimated the Indian?
PERCY FAWCETT
(beaming at his son’s
enthusiasm)
Of course...

JACK FAWCETT
Then why don’t we go back? You and
I, together--to find the lost city
once and for all?
PERCY FAWCETT

emotion)
I--I don’t know if I able, Jack.
JACK FAWCETT
I know you are. You easily
outmatch my strengths.
Fawcett STANDS, looks out at the VISTA as Jack continues:
PERCY FAWCETT
I am touched by your faith in me.
But--the war took its toll.
JACK FAWCETT
Father, the Americans will venture
there with their guns. And then we
must pray they do not destroy the
Indian. We must beat them to the
spot.
(beat; he smiles)
I want to go with you so much, I
want nothing more.
(beat)
We could find Z. You and I can do
it.
PERCY FAWCETT
On this, Jack, we must consult a
higher authority.

Your mother, I mean.
Jack lets out a laugh. Then:
JACK FAWCETT
Father, there is something else I
can barely speak of. I wish...to
apologize for the disgraceful
things I said to you before you
went away.
Fawcett turns back, looks at Jack.

JACK FAWCETT
Please, Mother. I know it’s
dangerous. But you’ve said
yourself with...with all that’s
happened--it’s not possible to
choose a safe passage through life.
So many men near my own age did not
return from the war--and who is to
say it will not happen again?
NINA FAWCETT
By all rights I should be furious.
You’ve used my very own words
against me.
(fighting with herself)
Yet I do not refute them now-indeed, try as I will, I cannot.
JACK FAWCETT
(beat; gets emotional)
Please...
NINA FAWCETT
(looks at Percy; then)
There’s little doubt I would worry
night and day about my two boys in

than overjoyed.
JACK FAWCETT
Thank you so much, Mum.

Thank you!

PERCY FAWCETT
We’re not there yet, Jack. These

money and training.
JACK FAWCETT
Of course, father... But I shall
begin preparing immediately,
nonetheless! You and I, and
perhaps Mr. Costin, too. He’ll
come, I know it!
Jack leaves the room. Fawcett turns to maps on his desk,
starts collecting them.
PERCY FAWCETT
I admit I’m surprised by your
speedy acceptance.
NINA FAWCETT
Did I have another choice? It
would be wrong to betray his nature
now.
(beat)
If you shall go, the both of you,
then you must find Z, once and for
all.
PERCY FAWCETT
Yes...we shall see it through...
I’ll go see Mr. Costin.
(beat; looks at her)
You’re concerned about Jack?
She does not answer.
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
He’ll perform splendidly. I’ve
learned from the past that
character is more important than
experience.
The CAMERA PANS to the WINDOW, to SEE JACK RUNNING. OUTSIDE
IS YOUNG JOAN, playing. Fawcett watches them both, then:
PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)

INT. SAVAGE CLUB - LONDON - NIGHT

It is the elegant club in London. A place for gentlemen.
Not a place for Percy. Men in black tie, men drinking
brandy. HENRY COSTIN is here, looking older, simultaneously
more settled yet more shattered.
Percy sits across from him. Both are in high-backed leather
chairs, and a small table sits between the two. Costin opens
a large BRIEFCASE sitting next to his chair. Withdraws
something...
Costin places NOTEBOOKS on the table and slides them to
Fawcett. With a smile:
HENRY COSTIN
In fine condition, Chief. All my
notes. I hope they are of help to
you.
Percy takes them as one would handle a delicate child.
PERCY FAWCETT
Can I truly not persuade you to
come with us?
Costin averts Percy’s gaze.
Whispering:

Percy leans forward.

PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
We were so close before.
HENRY COSTIN
I’m honored you still consider me
worthy.
PERCY FAWCETT
Of course--I could scarcely
consider it without you. I’ve
never known a more reliable person.
Costin seems on the verge of tears:

louder)
Yet my son today--if you were to
see his character, his vim and
vigor, for yourself, it would tear
down your resistance in an instant.
HENRY COSTIN
If I may be frank--I do believe you
have not always read men as well as
you might. You assume all share
your fire.
A WAITER comes over:
WAITER
Would you like some more brandy,
sir?
HENRY COSTIN
No, thank you.
Percy shakes his head as well.

The Waiter leaves.

PERCY FAWCETT
(smiling)
Neither of us could afford another.
The men laugh.
HENRY COSTIN
Chief--please do not misunderstand
me--I do not doubt Jack’s
excellence. But I’m afraid you and
I part ways in this regard. For
me, the search for Z-(almost breaks down)
I can no longer bear the cost, you
see.
PERCY FAWCETT
(surprised)
You...you doubt its existence.
HENRY COSTIN
Not for a moment.
Costin begins to protest further.

Fawcett stops him:

Percy Fawcett talks to a syndicate of newspapers. A press
conference. REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS pack the room. Jack
Fawcett and Nina are here, too, by Fawcett’s side. So are a
host of cigar-smoking financiers...
PERCY FAWCETT
This will be no pampered

Fawcett and Jack, inside a large conference room. A GROUP OF
PEOPLE is standing there, getting ready to SAY GOODBYE to
PERCY FAWCETT: KELTIE, WILLIAM BARCLAY, others.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE (CONT’D)
I’m proud to say, we did finally
meet them halfway...
(sobers; sheepish)
Percy, this organization has not...
always recognized you as perhaps we
should have in the past.
PERCY FAWCETT
Our differences were always
honorable, Sir John.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
(nods; then)
Sir George, rest in peace, always
bore you great affection. But I
admit my error in not accepting
your beliefs long ago.
Fawcett takes out his COMPASS.

Moves close to Keltie.

Keltie looks at it.

SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE (CONT’D)
We do have something here for you,

William Barclay OPENS A WOODEN CASE. Inside:

His eyes widen; he is truly impressed.

WILLIAM BARCLAY
You are truly deserving, Colonel.
Truly.
PERCY FAWCETT
(virtually moved to tears)
I’m grateful...

My son and I will rejoice in
telling you the whole story in

Fawcett grabs both arms, squeezes. Jack has a smile from ear
to ear. Champagne is served, and the men toast--in SILENCE.

Jack--

NINA FAWCETT

She gestures to his suit coat handkerchief, which is falling
out. Fawcett, meanwhile, moves close to her, out of earshot
of anyone else:
PERCY FAWCETT
Cheeky, if I should not come back-do not look for me. If one of us
lives, we all shall live.
NINA FAWCETT
(as though his death is an
insane thought)
I’ve complete faith in you. You’d
better get going, you’ll miss your
boat.
Fawcett moves to Brian, who is quiet.
PERCY FAWCETT
You’re a man now, responsible for
your mother and sister’s care.
It’s a fine calling, no less and
perhaps more virtuous than ours.
No response.

Percy Fawcett takes out a sealed LETTER.

NINA FAWCETT
Brian? Say goodbye to your father.
And tell him how much you’ll miss
him.
BRIAN FAWCETT
Goodbye, father. I shall indeed
miss you. As I always have.

Fawcett then leans over, kisses Nina briefly, and
unsentimentally boards the truck. Jack hugs Nina, who then

NINA FAWCETT (CONT’D)
I have trained myself to be
impartial to evidence, but surely
this is a sign.
SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
(in a state of shock)

NINA FAWCETT
Thank you, Sir John. It is all I
can ask.
Nina withdraws again. DEVASTATED BY HIS WORDS. A beat, and

Sir John looks up at Barclay.

Nina enters the hall. The camera PANS with her. We WATCH

roads, bridges, and complex
agricultural systems spread
throughout the jungle: an advanced
civilization.

The modern age had come to see, in
this way too, that Percy Fawcett
was correct.
