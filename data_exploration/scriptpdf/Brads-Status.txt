INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

1

BRAD SLOAN, lies in bed, staring anxiously up at the ceiling.
His wife, MELANIE, is asleep beside him. Moonlight
illuminates the room. It is deathly silent, then we HEAR a
NARRATOR’s voice.
NARRATOR
Brad was lying in bed at 3AM
wondering why he felt so anxious.
CLOSE ON BRAD as his mind wanders from thought to thought.
NARRATOR
He scanned through all the possible
sources of his dread - as there
were many - until he seized upon
the Architectural Digest.
Brad winces as his memory is stirred.

TEN PEOPLE are gathered in a living room, drinking and
chatting.

co-workers.

The page flips. The owner of the house, NICK and his LATINO
BOYFRIEND sit on the couch, grinning, in one of the photos.
NARRATOR
Brad realized the home belonged to
a college friend, Nick Pascale.
ON BRAD - he grimaces at the photo - a stricken look.

NARRATOR
The article stated he bought the
house for nine million dollars and
put another two into it.

nonetheless.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

As the other GUESTS, including Melanie, laugh and chat, Brad
glumly stares into space.
NARRATOR
This ruined the dinner party for
Brad. He stared into space mostly.
GLIMPSES of the other DINNER GUESTS, talking and eating.
NARRATOR
He realized the other people at the
table were mediocrities.
Underachieving beta males, living
in Sacramento, a secondary market.
Guys thinking they were big fish in
the most inconsequential of ponds.
Brad looks around at the others with a sour expression.
NARRATOR
He felt contempt for himself and
everyone there.

INT. BRAD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

5

Brad rolls over in bed, restless and agitated. He picks up
his cell phone on the side table. It GLOWS to life.
NARRATOR
Brad’s mind went to other successes
that pained him.
ON PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
We SEE Brad’s finger scroll across a SERIES of GOOGLE IMAGES
of Craig Fisher - a political wonk and talking head. Craig in a studio, posing with the President, getting interviewed.
NARRATOR
There was Craig Fisher - who had
worked for the White House. He had
written two successful books and
was always on TV. He had always
been a self-confident know-it-all
and now life had affirmed his
delusions of grandeur.
We now SEE Brad’s fingers ZOOM in close on a PHOTO of Craig,
his WIFE and TWO DAUGHTERS all smiles, at an event.
ON BRAD - illuminated by the light of the phone, he grimaces.
He puts the phone down. He looks back up at the ceiling.
NARRATOR
He thought about Jason Hatfield...

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

JASON HATFIELD walks with TWO EXECS. An attractive ASSISTANT
intercepts him and they hop in the back of a waiting SUV.
NARRATOR
...whose hedge fund had made him
obscenely wealthy. That he was a
nice guy who was a philanthropist
and had even given money to Brad’s
non-profit somehow made it even
worse.

INT. BRAD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Brad grits his teeth, his mind reeling.
NARRATOR
Everyone had won the lottery but
him. Bitter adrenaline pumped
through Brad’s body. He was never
going to get back to sleep.

INT. BRAD’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

9

Brad’s son, TROY, age six, is playing something for him on an
electric keyboard. Brad looks over at...
...THE TV - where Craig Fisher is being interviewed on a news
program.
NARRATOR
He remembered the first time he’d
seen Craig Fisher being interviewed
on TV.
ON BRAD - he stops listening to Troy and stares mesmerized at
the TV. He rises, pointing at Craig’s talking head.
NARRATOR
The memory was like a cluster of
needles in his heart. This wasn’t
a fleeting jealousy. It was pain.
It was real pain.
BRAD
(calling toward kitchen)
Melanie!
CLOSER ON BRAD - as he digests this vision.
NARRATOR
Why was it so painful?

What the hell? You just hit me in

Sorry, sorry. I can’t sleep.

How much do you think your parents
house is worth?
MELANIE
My parents’ house?

I don’t know.

BRAD
Like two million?

Two and a half?

MELANIE
I don’t know.
BRAD
You’ve never thought about it?
MELANIE
Not really.
BRAD
(grabs his phone)
It’ll say on Zillow.

MELANIE
Why are you doing this?

BRAD
(types into phone)
It says 1.857. That seems low, no?
For Seattle? 4300 square feet.
Zillow is always low. I bet 2.5 at
least. Don’t you think?

it all to the grandkids.

they’re already rich. We only have
one. How’s that fair?

Right. I work for a non-profit.

BRAD
Thank god we only had one kid.
Oh my god.

I just feel like we’re running out
of time here. There’s no more
potential - this is it - we’ve

gonna be some windfall out of
nowhere that’s gonna change the
situation...

MELANIE
We’re not poor, Brad.
BRAD
In some circles.

Yeah.

MELANIE
What circles? The one per cent?
Please. Go to sleep.
Brad rolls over, then rolls back to her.
I can’t.

BRAD

MELANIE
Stop thinking about this.
BRAD
We didn’t work this hard to end up
dying in a flophouse. You know?
MELANIE
(turning away from him)
You’re freaking me out. Enough.
We have a great life.
BRAD
I think you should talk to your
parents and get some clarity.
The grandkids don’t need the money.
Especially Steve and Vanessa’s.
I’ve seen their posts. They live
like Saudi Arabian princesses. They
have their whole lives ahead of
them anyway. You and I are done!

I’ve learned a lot from you. But I

depressed. And I actually think I
can do more good by just making a
lot of money - and giving it away.
Instead of spending all my time
asking other people for their money
to give away. You know?
Brad stares at him, floored.

INT. MELANIE’S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

As Melanie and Troy chat, Brad stares out the window, sinking
into a deep funk.
NARRATOR
As he remembered the exchange, Brad
felt a hot flush of humiliation.
He felt exposed in some essential
and embarrassing way. It seemed so
obvious that his life’s work was an
absurdity. It might as well be
tattooed across his face.
Brad absently covers the invisible tattoo on his forehead.

As she types...

BRAD
I was hoping I could use my miles.
I have a bunch of miles I think...
AIRLINE REP
Unfortunately, no - not for this
flight, you can’t. The cost to
upgrade to business would be eight

There’s actually no amount of money
you could pay to get an upgrade.

Wasn’t he the one destined for
great things? How did he end up

BRAD’S DAD, a rumpled academic, sits in a reading chair,
jotting his thoughts onto a yellow legal pad.
NARRATOR
His dad had been a professor and
had spent years writing an
exhaustive study on Institutional
Fascism that was never published.
Brad’s Dad reads over what he’s just written, finds it

disappointments.
Brad shakes his head with self-loathing.

his ear buds.
NARRATOR
Brad was electrified by this latest
development. Here - suddenly - an
unexpected lifeline - something
tangible - an outward proof.
ON COMPUTER - Brad is watching a home video of Troy playing
piano. He’s clearly a prodigy.
Of course.

NARRATOR
His child.

His son.

Brad has tears in his eyes as he watches the video.
NARRATOR
A genius. With substance. His
heart could burst with this deep
satisfaction.
He looks over at...
...Troy, watching GAME OF THRONES on his laptop.
NARRATOR
Brad realized along the way, he’d
somehow lost the plot. Cured of
his amnesia, he now remembered what
he’d been doing for the last
seventeen years.
Troy senses he’s being watched.

He looks over.

Brad felt numb. The fact that he’d

Brad stops in his tracks.

A small wedding party. Nick and Xavier are congratulated by
Craig and Diane, then Jason Hatfield and his family.

him to be jealous - or insecure

Brad watches TWO STUDENTS - a young, attractive couple - walk
past, holding hands. They are in love.
NARRATOR
What a waste of energy to resent
other people’s few pleasures.
Brad watches them go.
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, looking harried and stressed, is next to

Brad takes Troy in with a proud, melancholy smile.
He then turns his attention to the stage.
ON STAGE - Ananya, on her flute, and Maya, on her violin, are
playing their duet.
ON BRAD - as he listens, he looks increasingly stunned.

They’re so good.
Shh.

The concert continues.
Ananya and Maya are extraordinarily talented.
NARRATOR
These girls are beautiful.
ON BRAD - he is visibly moved.
NARRATOR
He could love them and never
possess them.
The entire orchestra joins in - the music is gorgeous.
NARRATOR
Just like he could love the world
and never possess it.
A dam of emotion bursts.

Brad is now crying in his seat.

NARRATOR
He still did love the world.
Deep, cathartic tears.
Troy looks over and sees that his father is crying.
Dad?

You want some chips?

No.

It’s just... sometimes I have

person thinking about you is me.
So the only opinion that should
matter to you is mine.

Brad stares at the balcony doors. A draft of wind blows the
curtains slightly. We HEAR a faint whistling noise.
NARRATOR
A sudden rush of feeling flooded
Brad. He lay there a while,
letting himself really feel the
life inside him. He kept saying in
his mind - I’m alive. I’m alive.
I’m still alive.
Brad smiles to himself rolling over on his side, turning away
from us - we HEAR the beginning of Dvorak’s “Humoresque” and
we...
