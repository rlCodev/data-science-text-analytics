INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - DAY
MOLLY (18, hardcore, sleeps with a titanium biteguard)
MEDITATES as she listens to a MOTIVATIONAL TAPE.
MOTIVATIONAL VOICE (O.S.)
Good morning, winner. Take a deep
breath.
(takes a deep breath)
Good. You’re ready to dominate
this day.
Her small bedroom is crammed with textbooks, notebooks, real
books, academic awards.
MOTIVATIONAL VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
You’ve worked harder than everyone,
and that is why you’re a champion.
Photos of women like Michelle Obama, RBG, Susan B. Anthony
and Gloria Steinham line her bookshelves.
MOTIVATIONAL VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
You understand that greatness takes
sacrifice. Visualize what you
still want to achieve.
A “Valedictorian” ribbon lays across a graduation gown
hanging on her mirror.
MOTIVATIONAL VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Stand upon the mountain of your
success and look down at everyone
who’s ever doubted you.
(a beat)
Fuck those losers. Fuck them in
their stupid, fucking faces.
Molly’s eyes pop open. She removes her biteguard.
INT. AMY’S CAR - DAY/EXT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Amy (18, a big-hearted social justice warrior) pulls up to
Molly’s building, honking just as Molly comes outside-- they
have this timed perfectly. Molly does a little dance for Amy
as she walks to the car.
AMY
Oh shit. Oooh, shit. Look at her
go. Hold the phone. I’m coming...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Amy gets out of the car and starts DANCING WITH MOLLY on the
sidewalk. They dance for a long, long beat.
MOLLY
I missed you.
AMY
I missed you. So much.
MOLLY
It’s been one night.
They just keep dancing.
AMY
Are we gonna go to school, or...
MOLLY
I don’t think we are.
AMY
Nope, we’re just gonna stay
right...here.
EXT. CROCKET HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Amy’s rickety Volvo pulls up to their high school, already
buzzing with RAMBUNCTIOUS, GIDDY STUDENTS practically
vibrating with last-day-energy.
EXT./INT. CROCKETT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
The courtyard BUZZES with LOUD, Everybody’s shrieking or
laughing or crying with their friends. Molly and Amy walk
through like salmon swimming upstream, dodging SKATEBOARDERS.
They pass an EMOTIONAL GIRL crying with her friends-EMOTIONAL GIRL
I mean these were the best four
years of our lives!
Molly gives Amy a look.
MOLLY
Can you imagine a world in which
these were actually the best four
years of our lives?

(CONTINUED)

3.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Maybe if I immediately lost all my
limbs, and my eyesight and hearing,
and I was just like a human potato.
I’d be like, “remember when I had
my limbs and could see and hear?
Those were the best four years.”
MOLLY
Or if I was convicted of a crime I
didn’t commit and spent the rest of
my life in a Thai prison.
AMY
If I spent the rest of my life
reading in the backseat of a car.
MOLLY
You do get so carsick.
They walk INSIDE, where it’s even rowdier. Molly pushes her
way through the chaos-MOLLY (CONT’D)
Where was this energy at my
inauguration assembly, folks?!
INT. PRINCIPAL BROWN’S OFFICE - DAY
Molly and Amy stop outside PRINCIPAL BROWN’s office as he
finishes the morning announcements on a PA SYSTEM.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
...and please do not attempt a
senior prank. I have eyes and ears
every where and you will not
succeed. I don’t wanna have to
suspend you right before
graduation. I hope I never have to
see any of you again. All right,
signing off. Gooooo Crocketts!
He turns off the PA system, putting it away, when-MOLLY
Principal Brown.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
(”kill me”)
Molly. Amy. What’s shaking?

CONTINUED:
MOLLY
I’m trying to make the transition
to next year’s student government
President as seamless as possible
so when I’m up in New Haven-PRINCIPAL BROWN
Yale. You can say just Yale.
AMY
Our class’s official policy is to
not discuss where people are
attending next year. We don’t want
anyone to feel insecure.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Very thoughtful.
MOLLY
Anyway, I need to go over the endof-year budget numbers we have.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Really? Can’t you just do it with
Nick? He’s your Vice President.
MOLLY
We both know Nick only ran for VP
because they plan the dances. That
position is basically a popularity
contest. He’s useless.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Ladies, it’s the last day. We did
it! We got you through high school.
He stands and walks over to them.
PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D)
Can’t we just graduate? Head off to
college? Celebrate this wonderful
achievement?
He starts slowly closing the door.
PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D)
Let’s just focus on getting through
the rest of the day without
anything horrible happening, okay?
MOLLY
I’m sorry, are you shutting the
door on us? This isn’t subtle.

MOLLY (CONT'D)
You can’t just close the door. We
will persist--

He shuts it in their faces.
INT. HALLWAYS - CROCKETT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Molly and Amy walk back down the hallway. Amy watches as
NICK holds court with his friends TANNER and THEO and a TON
OF GIRLS all trying to flirt with him. Nick RAMS his head
into his locker, popping it open. Everyone laughs.
AMY
It is kinda impressive. Nick’s like
the great equalizer. Delegates from
every group of girls are casting
their ballots for his penis.
A HOT GIRL, TRIPLE A, giggles at Nick, touching his chest.
MOLLY
And Triple A takes the lead!
AMY
Don’t call her that.
MOLLY
Everyone calls her that. She gave
“roadside assistance” to three
senior guys last year.
AMY
And do you hear them getting
degrading nicknames?
MOLLY
They call Sam Ross “Dick Splinter.”
AMY
That’s not derogatory. It’s a
factual description. Sam Ross had
an actual splinter in his penis.
INT. MISS FINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
Molly and Amy walk up to MISS FINE (30, their teacher crush)
sitting at the teacher’s desk.
MOLLY/AMY
Hi Miss Fine!

(CONTINUED)

6.
CONTINUED:
Miss Fine holds up a completed NY TIMES CROSSWORD.
MISS FINE
Seven minutes twenty seconds.
Molly and Amy groan and hold up the SAME CROSSWORD.
AMY
Nine forty-three.
MISS FINE
What am I gonna do without you two
next year? Nobody else here even
attempts the Thursday puzzle.
MOLLY
We’ll still send you our Sunday
times. Amy and I are gonna Skype
the crossword every weekend.
MISS FINE
You know what? I’m gonna give you
guys my number. If you have any
questions or need anything next
year, text me.
They try to play it cool, but this is the best moment of
their lives. They each try to hand her their own phone, but
Molly boxes Amy out and gets hers into Miss Fine’s hands.
Triple A walks in and rolls her eyes-TRIPLE A
I thought phones weren’t allowed in
class, Miss Fine. Unless there’s an
exception for ass kissers?
MISS FINE
You better put a dollar in the
swear jar.
(holding out her hand)
The swear jar is my hand. Give me a
dollar.
Triple A shrugs innocently.
TRIPLE A
I’m so sorry, these shorts don’t
have pockets.
GEORGE and ALAN, two magnificently dramatic theater kids,
push their way toward their seats--

GEORGE
EXCUSE ME!
(as he sits)
There is no spacial awareness at
this school...
Molly and Amy squeal over Miss Fine’s number as they settle
into their desks. HOPE (gorgeous, intimidating) watches.
HOPE
Hey, Amy.
(Amy turns)
Did you just score your teacher’s
phone number?
Yeah!

AMY

HOPE
(fatally sarcastically)
Nice.
Hope smirks at her and settles back into her seat. Amy
frowns, stung.
Theo and Tanner drop into their seats behind Molly and Amy.
Theo calls up to Miss Fine-THEO
Miss Fine, you gonna come party
with us tonight?
MOLLY
Did you just ask Miss Fine if she
wants to party with you? You think
she wants to watch you and your
friends get drunk and break things?
THEO
Sorry, I was having a conversation
with her, you were not a part of
this-MOLLY
Sit down, Theo.
Theo glares but sits just as sweet, eager JARED (18) walks
in. He’s decked out in the most expensive stuff possible, but
tries too hard to ever be truly cool.

(CONTINUED)

8.
CONTINUED: (3)
JARED
What up Miss Fine! Just wanted to
drop off a last-day present for my
favorite teach!
MISS FINE
Jared, you are not my student.
JARED
I’ve heard great things.
(to the class)
And everybody else got their
graduation gifts, right?
He shows off the shirt he’s wearing: a series of photos of
his face inside his face inside his face.
JARED (CONT’D)
Pretty cool, right? Jare-bear
coming at you from all angles.
GEORGE
Nobody asked for that.
JARED
(playing with the shirt)
Big me, littler me, little baby
Jare at the bottom. Baby Jare says
“happy graduation, everybody!”
HOPE
Nobody’s gonna wear a shirt with
your face on it, Jared. Not even
ironically.
JARED
Well, agree to disagree, because
they’re out in the cafeteria now-Jared! Go!

MISS FINE

JARED
I’m gone. I’m out of here.
(then, quickly)
Bye Molly.
He steals one last look at Molly and hurries away as George
and Alan jump on the makeshift STAGE at the front of the
room.

ALAN
Fair townspeople.
(no reaction)
Fair townspeople!
GEORGE
FAIR TOWNSPEOPLE, I SWEAR TO GOD.
ALAN
Mark thy calendars and plan thy
trip to the Drama Department’s
summer program: Shakespeare in the
Park-ing Lot.
GEORGE
We’ll be performing the Bard’s
comedies as modern tragedies
outside Whole Foods across town!
(very pleased with
himself)
It’s something we did last year in
my program in Barthelona. When I
lived in Barthelona.
Molly closes her eyes, too annoyed to retort.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I’ll be directing and Alan may be
starring pending auditions.
ALAN
I do not audition, I am offer only.
They hop off the stage and start handing out flyers.
AMY
It sounds awesome, but I won’t be
here.
MOLLY
Amy’s spending the summer in
Botswana helping women make their
own tampons.
Gross.

GEORGE

AMY
Blood attracts lions. I’m saving
lives.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (5)
MOLLY
And I can’t either because I’m
working all summer and also I don’t
want to.
GEORGE
You are a philistine.
MOLLY
Who would do theater when you could
do debate?
GEORGE
Some of us know how to play well
with others.
MOLLY
And some of us know how to win.
GEORGE
Nobody’s winning in that outfit.
George glares at her as Miss Fine stands and CLAPS her hands-MISS FINE
Get in those seats. We still have
one day of school left. Molly, why
don’t you start us off.
Molly stands as the rest of the class GROANS.
MOLLY
Thank you, Ms. Fine. If you guys
recall how I ended yesterday...
Amy sits back to watch, adoringly, as her best friend
presents to the class.
EXT. LUNCH ROOM - CROCKETT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Molly walks her lunch past Nick as he’s trying to catch chips
Theo’s throwing in his mouth. She approaches him.
Nick--

MOLLY

NICK
One second.
MOLLY
Nick, we need to finalize the
budget. Can you focus for 2 secon--

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED:
He misses a chip, laughing.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Nick I really need your-NICK
Sorry, we’re playing a game where
I’ve gotta catch it in my mouth,
it’s complicated.
MOLLY
Yes, it looks super complicated.
Molly gives up and walks over to Amy sitting at a table.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
I can’t believe I had to put up
with Nick as my VP for a whole
year. He’s allergic to work. He
just goofs off and dicks around-Molly realizes Amy isn’t listening-- she’s staring off at a
beautiful SKATER doing tricks with her friends.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Just go talk to Ryan.
AMY
Oh, no. No thank you. I’m good.
MOLLY
Cool. Then I’ll go talk to Ryan.
Molly moves like she’s going to dash over and Amy jumps to
her feet. Molly gives her a look.
Fine!

AMY
Fine.

Amy takes a deep breath and psychs herself up as she walks
over there. She’s so distracted by the psyching of herself
up that she doesn’t notice Ryan start to skate away and SLAMS
right into her, knocking her off her board.
AMY (CONT’D)
Oh my god Ryan, I’m so sorry!
RYAN
(laughing)
You’re got some sharp elbows.

(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED: (2)
AMY
Not as sharp as your...chin.
(an awkward beat)
Can you believe it’s the last day?
RYAN
I know, it’s crazy. You don’t have
to waste your free periods tutoring
me French anymore.
AMY
(blushing)
I didn’t mind. It was my job.
RYAN
Hey, are you coming to Nick’s
tonight? His aunt’s on a cruise
ship that broke down and everyone
got norovirus so he’s having a
party at her house.
AMY
That sounds so cool.
RYAN
No, it’s super bad. They’re all
shitting in buckets and they’re
stuck on a boat.
AMY
No I meant-- never mind.
Ryan laughs. Amy laughs, too, not really sure why. Then a BRO
rides by between them and Amy panics and uses the distraction
to hurry back to Molly.
MOLLY
What are you doing? Go back!
AMY
It’s fine. Really. I don’t even
know if she’s into girls.
MOLLY
She wore a polo shirt to prom.
AMY
That’s just her gender performance,
not her sexual orientation.
MOLLY
I’m sorry, but I don’t get it.

(CONTINUED)

13.
CONTINUED: (3)
AMY
Well gender is a construct of-MOLLY
That much I understand, thank you.
It’s just a little bit shocking
that you’re into Ryan. Your first
crush was the little white cat from
the Aristocats. You go from that to
Avril Lavigne...it’s just not what
I anticipated.
AMY
I just like that she’s always in a
good mood. And her cute laugh. She
seems like a fun person to have
sleepovers and lie around with.
MOLLY
Excuse me? I’m a fun person to have
sleepovers and lie around with.
That’s literally all we do.
AMY
Yeah but with her there’d be
more...vagina involved.
Amy watches longingly as Ryan laughs with some OTHER GIRLS.
AMY (CONT’D)
She said Nick’s having a party
tonight.
MOLLY
Of course he would. He’s so stupid.
Someone always gets arrested the
night before graduation.
Molly sees Amy watching and puts her arm around her.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Amy do you know how many cute
lesbians are going to be crawling
up your vag at Columbia next year?
Every time I come to visit you’re
gonna be scissoring a different
girl. You’re gonna be like Edward
Scissor-Legs. Snipping left and
right...
AMY
Dude, we’ve been over this.
Scissoring is not a thing.

MOLLY
How bout we don’t knock it til we
try it?
EXT. COURTYARD - CROCKETT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
As a CLASSIC 70’s MUSCLE CAR screeches past them and into a
spot in the student lot. Amy shakes her head, annoyed.
AMY
Here comes the one percent.
Jared’s driving and GIGI (18, gorgeous, wild) leans out of
the passenger seat, her hair in the wind.
AMY (CONT’D)
That car should be in a museum. The
Museum of Death. Because its smog
is killing us all.
Jared parks and Gigi turns, confused-GIGI
Jared, I said door to door!
MOLLY
They spend every minute together.
It’s so weird.
AMY
We spend every minute together.
MOLLY
But we’re equals. Gigi’s just
keeping Jared around for when she
needs a liver.
They watch Gigi start crawling up Jared’s windshield.
AMY
You think it’s true his dad got him
a sex worker for his 14th birthday?
MOLLY
It’s too weird of a story to make
up. And there were too many
specifics. She had a hearing aid,
he sprained his ankle...
Jared notices them staring and waves--

(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED:
JARED
WHAT UP CHICAS!
(then)
You guys hungry? I brought back
some soup dumps! They’re probably a
little soggy now, but they’re great
cold!
MOLLY
Oh, God. I’m going to pee in your
weirdass bathroom, watch my stuff.
AMY
(calling after her)
Until all of us can pee without
genitals, none of us can!
INT. GENDERLESS BATHROOM - DAY
Molly is peeing in a stall when she notices graffiti on the
wall: “your ugly.”
MOLLY
These motherfuckers.
what?

Your ugly

She takes a pen from her pocket and corrects the graffiti’s
grammar as THEO and TANNER enter the bathroom, midconversation.
THEO
Okay, so, I’d marry the sex doll,
fuck the soccer ball, and kill
Molly.
TANNER
(laughing)
Dude, no.
In her stall, Molly FREEZES.
THEO
There’s no other way. I can’t fuck
her cause you know when I’m scared
I can’t get hard. I can’t marry her
cause I don’t believe in the
institution. I have to kill Molly.
And I know it’ll haunt me. I’m a
peaceful person.
Outside, another stall door opens and TRIPLE A emerges.

(CONTINUED)

16.
CONTINUED:
TRIPLE A
Are you talking about Molly
Davidson? That girl is so weird.
She always acts like she’s like,
forty.
THEO
I wish she was forty, man. Women in
their forties know themselves.
TANNER
She’s cute, but she’d probably make
you quiz her on SAT analogies while
you’re fucking her.
THEO
Her vag is probably stuffed with
diplomas, how you wanna bet? I bet
it’s like a filing cabinet.
TANNER
I’ve got no problem with a filing
cabinet. I would make passionate
sex to Molly Davidson.
(a beat)
I’d just put a bag over her
personality.
TRIPLE A
Molly’s like a Butterface for
personality. A Butterpersonality.
They all laugh. In the stall, Molly’s trying not to cry. She
takes a deep breath -- and then she sets her jaw, stands and
walks out. Everyone stops, awkward.
MOLLY
Don’t stop on my account. Cause you
know what? My vag is stuffed with
diplomas, and soon it’s going to be
stuffed with job offers, and
glowing profiles, and commendations
from my governor, because while you
were studying for AP Hand Jobs I
was kicking ass and busting curves.
And that means I get to keep doing
that at Yale next year. So, yeah, I
like my choices. And wherever you
are next year, I hope you do too.
A beat. Molly’s kind of impressed with herself. That speech
was fucking awesome. Until--

(CONTINUED)

17.
CONTINUED: (2)
TRIPLE A
I’m going to Yale, too.
Molly just stares at her for a moment.
What?

MOLLY

TRIPLE A
I’m incredible at hand jobs. But I
also got a 1560 on the SATs.
MOLLY
No you didn’t.
TRIPLE A
I got in early.
To Yale?

MOLLY

TRIPLE A
(innocently)
Tanner, where are you going to
school?
TANNER
I’m playing soccer at Stanford.
MOLLY
Stanford University? What are you
guys talking about?
THEO
I’m not going to college.
(then)
I got recruited to code for Google.
It’s not Apple but the bennies are
tight and it’s mid six-figures.
MOLLY
You failed the seventh grade twice.
THEO
(shrugging)
Rule of threes.
Molly looks between them, realizing-MOLLY
You guys are being serious?

18.
CONTINUED: (3)
TRIPLE A
I may pretend I don’t know you next
year. No offense.
MOLLY
That’s not-- you’re not-- This
isn’t possible. You guys don’t even
care about school.
TRIPLE A
No, we just don’t only care about
school.
A kernel of panic starts growing in Molly’s stomach.
INT. HALLWAYS - CROCKETT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Molly marches out of the bathroom. She runs into Amy, who
notices Molly’s face-AMY
What’s wrong?
Molly sees Nick running past them and grabs him.
MOLLY
Nick, where are you going next
year?
NICK
For college? I thought the whole
thing was that we weren’t supp-MOLLY
JUST TELL ME.
NICK
Georgetown, jeez.
Amy’s surprised. Nick just takes off again. Molly sees Hope
adjusting her makeup in the reflection of a trophy case-MOLLY
Hope, where are y-HOPE
I couldn’t be less interested in
whatever’s happening here.
Molly just keeps marching down the hall toward Gigi.

19.
CONTINUED:
MOLLY
Gigi! Quick question. Where are you
going to school next year?
GIGI
Don’t judge me. It was my fifth
choice.
(then, disappointed)
Harvard.
That’s it. Molly’s head explodes, just as the BELL RINGS,
people flood out of class, and Nick comes back around the
corner, raising his arms-NICK
SENIORS RULE!!
He puts on a SNORKEL as he and his friends pull out buckets
of CONDOM WATER BALLOONS and start throwing them everywhere.
Suddenly it’s total joyful chaos. Colorful splashes explode
everywhere. Two SKATERS ride down the hallway spraying FIRE
EXTINGUISHERS. Everybody’s shrieking and laughing and having
the time of their life -- except for Molly.
In SLOW-MOTION a CONDOM WATER BALLOON flies through the air
and EXPLODES on Molly’s face, and we CUT TO....
INT. AMY’S CAR - DAY
Amy drives a silent, soaking wet Molly.
EXT. PICNIC TABLE - THE VALLEY - DUSK
Molly leans against a well-worn PICNIC TABLE, in shock. Amy’s
set out a CAKE and a MEMORY BOX and is playing an AUTO-HARP,
making up a song to try to cheer Molly up.
AMY
If you don’t say something in the
next ten minutes / I’m gonna take
you to the hospital / I don’t wanna
say I’m getting concerned / But to
be honest I’m getting concerned-MOLLY
Triple A?! Fucking Triple A?! This
is FUCKED.
Amy slides away the auto-harp.

(CONTINUED)

20.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Ok, that’s obviously not helping...
MOLLY
We chose. We didn’t party because
we wanted to focus on school and
get into good colleges.
AMY
And it worked.
MOLLY
But the irresponsible people who
partied also got into good
colleges! They did both!
So?

AMY

MOLLY
So we messed up! We didn’t have to
choose! They did both and we’re the
only assholes who did one!
AMY
We’re not assholes! Let’s just have
some cake and celebrate the end-MOLLY
This is not a time to celebrate.
(turning back to Amy)
We have to go to a party tonight.
What?

AMY

MOLLY
Let’s go to Nick’s party.
AMY
Are you kidding? No way.
MOLLY
We only have one night left to have
studied and partied in high school.
Otherwise we’ll always be the girls
who missed out. We never made out
with strangers or snuck out and had
to sneak home without waking up our
parents or broke any rules!
AMY
We broke rules! We have fake IDs.

(CONTINUED)

21.
CONTINUED: (2)
MOLLY
Fake college IDs so we could get
into their 24-hour library!
AMY
That counts. Plus, what’s so great
about breaking rules? Name one
person whose life was better cause
they broke rules.
Picasso.

MOLLY

AMY
That’s not-- he broke art rules.
Name someone who broke a real rule-MOLLY
Rosa Parks.
AMY
(a beat)
Name anoth-MOLLY
Susan B. Anthony.
Goddamnit.

AMY

MOLLY
I’m serious, Amy. Everyone thinks
we’re these robots. They think all
we care about is taking a million
APs and getting into Yale and
editing Law Review at Georgetown
and clerking for a Federal Judge
between Junior and Senior Year
before eventually being the
youngest justice ever nominated to
the Supreme Court of the United
States!
(then, awkwardly)
In my case. You get my point. No
one knows we can be fun too.
AMY
We do. We know.
MOLLY
(intense)
They need to know.

AMY
Who’s “they?”
MOLLY
We’re not one-dimensional. We’re
smart and fun. We have to do this.
AMY
This is crazy. We graduate
tomorrow. What if we get in
trouble?
MOLLY
You know we’re too smart for that.
Plus Ryan wanted you to come. She’s
gonna be there and you’re finally
gonna make a move.
AMY
(flustered)
What? That-- She-- no.
Molly sits next to Amy.
MOLLY
You’ve been out for two years and
you’ve never kissed a girl. I want
you to experience this.
(intense)
And what will I be doing during
that time? I’m going to experience
a seminal fun anecdote, and we’re
gonna change our stories. Forever.
Amy’s cracking.
AMY
We were gonna watch that Ken Burns
thing...
Molly knows she’s got her. She jumps up, pumped-MOLLY
The Dust Bowl can wait, bitch! What
took them four years, we’re gonna
do in one night.
She’s so pumped that she grabs the cake and TOSSES IT off the
hill. MUSIC’S UP as we CUT TO...

23.
INT. AMY’S ROOM - NIGHT
A cozy flurry of protest signs, books, and photos of lady
heroes like Gloria Steinem and Jane Goodall. Molly and Amy
burst inside and begin getting ready to go out:
--Molly throws open a drawer labelled “MOLLY,” full of her
clothes, looking for an outfit.
--Molly and Amy admire each other’s OUTFITS:
MOLLY
No. Not acceptable.
AMY
Nope. This is not okay.
MOLLY
Who allowed you to be this
beautiful?
AMY
Who allowed you to be this
beautiful?
MOLLY
Who allowed you to take? My breath?
Away?
AMY
Call the paramedics, all the
police, because there has been an
EMERGENCY!
MOLLY
You are STUNNING. I HAVE NO BREATH---Molly and Amy watch a YOUTUBE refresher on self-defense
moves. They practice the GRIP ESCAPE MOVE.
--Molly stuffs a copy of her passport and their fake UCLA IDs
in a HIDDEN MONEY BELT people use when traveling abroad.
--Amy twists a MACE KEYCHAIN on her keys, demonstrating how
it works to Molly:
AMY
Okay, this is important. Always
make sure the safety is on-SPPPP. It sprays mace. Molly screams. Amy screams--

INT. AMY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Amy puts some finishing touches on her outfit. She looks over
and sees Molly writing something at her desk.
AMY
What are y-- are you making a
checklist for a night of partying?
MOLLY
Of course I am.
(going over it)
Killer outfits, safety tutorial,
check check. Get address, secure
safe transportation, you find Ryan,
flirt for 15-20 minutes, bring her
somewhere more quiet, ride her like
a pony, I prove I’m fun, home by 1.
AMY
Are you gonna hook up with anybody?
Molly scoffs very loudly.
MOLLY
No. No way. High school boys are
just horny, pimply distractions.
Men don’t even come online til
they’re 28 and then they don’t peak
til they’re like 40. I’m holding
out for an Econ TA next year.
AMY
If Ryan wants to go further than
making out, I have no idea what to
do...down there.
MOLLY
Of course you do. You have the same
parts she does, just take whatever
you do to yourself and turn it
upside down.
AMY
(reddening)
I don’t really do anything...

(CONTINUED)

25.
CONTINUED:
MOLLY
Guys talk about this stuff all the
time! It’s honestly offensive that
we don’t. It’s misogynistic of us!
A long pause.
AMY
What if I don’t use my hands?
MOLLY
(impressed, whispered)
You can make yourself come using
only your mind? That’s like the one
thing my mind can’t do!
AMY
No! I use...other stuff.
Molly follows Amy’s eyes to her bookshelf.
MOLLY
A book?! That’s very Freudian. But
I’d worry about paper cuts.
AMY
No! Like, something soft. Can we
please stop talking about this?
Molly eyes a couple of stuffed animals on Amy’s shelf.
MOLLY
The alligator?
Reveal a cute fuzzy ALLIGATOR with a long, phallic snout.
AMY
No. Can we just-The dog?

MOLLY

AMY
Stop. My grandma got me that right
before she died.
MOLLY
Just tell me what-AMY
The panda, okay? Whatever.

(CONTINUED)

26.
CONTINUED: (2)
Molly eyes an innocent-looking panda bear on the shelf. It’s
missing an eye.
MOLLY
What happened to his eye?
AMY
(quickly)
That fell off way before anything
happened with us.
MOLLY
Does he talk dirty? Tell you how
he’s endangered?
Stop!

AMY

MOLLY
You are such a sneaky bitch! I
can’t believe I didn’t know you’ve
been mounting that old fuzzy panda
every night!
(then)
Honestly, it’s kinda exhilarating.
I thought we knew everything about
each other. It’s probably healthy
for a relationship to have a
secret, and now we have one.
Amy nods a little too quickly, but Molly doesn’t notice.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Do I have any? I once tried to
masturbate with an electric
toothbrush but I just got a
terrible UTI.
AMY
I wish that had been a secret, but
you’ve mentioned it many, many
times.
INT. LIVING ROOM - AMY’S HOUSE - DAY
Amy and Molly sneak out of Amy’s room. Amy’s got an overnight
bag. They’re in puffy coats to hide their outfits.
AMY
I need you to do the talking.

(CONTINUED)

27.
CONTINUED:
MOLLY
Why don’t you just tell them we’re
going to a party?
AMY
They’ll ask too many questions and
try to call Nick’s aunt. I’ve never
lied to my parents before and you
know when I lie I add too many
details. Just make up a story. But
don’t say we’re having a date night
or anything.
MOLLY
Why? It’s funny that your parents
think we’re secretly boning.
AMY
You’re not the one who has to deal
with their creepy smiles when I
tell them I’m meeting you at the
library. When I am actually meeting
you at the library.
MOLLY
At least they support you. I
wouldn’t have expected that, given
their whole...Jesus...thing. It’s
nice!
They round the corner to find Amy’s mom CHARMAINE (40s) and
father DOUG (40s) preparing dinner in the kitchen.
Heeeeeeeeey.

AMY

Hi!

MOLLY (CONT'D)

DOUG
Charmaine, get to the safe room.
We’re being robbed by supermodels!
CHARMAINE
You girls look fabulous! And smart.
And also brave.
DOUG
You guys cold? I’ll start a fire,
or I’ll turn up the heat! Get those
jackets off, dinner’s almost ready!
CHARMAINE
Try one of these. I’m calling them
“diplo-meatballs.” They’re vegan.

(CONTINUED)

28.
CONTINUED: (2)
Molly steps forward to take one but Amy holds her back.
AMY
(sotto to Molly)
Nope. We can’t engage.
MOLLY
Char-char, Dougsicle...we were
wondering...is it okay if Amy
sleeps over at my house?
A beat.
CHARMAINE
The night before graduation?
MOLLY
My mom can take us to the ceremony.
We just want more time together
before she leaves for Africa.
DOUG
But we made mushroom-cap-and-gowns.
There are special names for all of
these things.
(pointing to a dish)
Chips and Sal-So Long, High School!
(pointing to another dish)
Cheese and Sala-me, being your dad,
was the greatest honor of my life.
(pointing to another dish)
Melba Toast to your future-Charmaine grabs his arm and gives him a meaningful look.
CHARMAINE
But you know what, we get it. We
understand. We do. Because what you
girls have is very special.
MOLLY
It really is. They say you never
forget your first...
Friend.

AMY

MOLLY
Special friend.
AMY
Normal friend.

(CONTINUED)

29.
CONTINUED: (3)
MOLLY
We’re just so grateful we’ll have
the whole night. To really show
each other just how much we care
about each other.
CHARMAINE
That’s great.
MOLLY
Every inch of each other.
AMY
(quickly)
We’ll probably just do a Korean
face mask.
CHARMAINE
I don’t need to know all the words.
EXT. AMY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly and Amy run outside, zipping off their puffy coats. Amy
stuffs them in the overnight bag, tosses the overnight bag
into the bushes, and they sprint down the street.
MORE SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS AND PHOTOS
QUICK CUTS of PARTY FOOTAGE -- People CHICKEN FIGHT in the
pool...a DRUNK GUY bounces off a trampoline and lands in the
pool with a BELLY FLOP... Two GUYS wearing LAMPSHADES on
their heads run and slam into each other like bulls. An
audience watches Tanner eats a GHOST PEPPER, then FREAKS OUT-EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Amy’s watching these on her cell as Molly makes phone calls.
AMY
Oh my God he ate a ghost pepper. He
needs milk. Someone get him milk!
(then, swiping through)
Dude a lot of people are already
there.
MOLLY
(hangs up, frowns)
Fuck, no one’s answering.
(yelling at her phone)
Somebody give us the ADDRESS!

(CONTINUED)

30.
CONTINUED:
AMY
We’ve never hung out with any of
these people outside of academic
activities. They probably think
we’re calling about school stuff.
MOLLY
You’re right. Let’s just call a
Lyft.
AMY
We still don’t know where we’re
going! We’d need a Lyft driver who
knows where Nick’s aunt lives.
Molly frowns, then gets an idea.
MOLLY
We might have one of those.
She dials a number.
AMY
Who are you calling?
MOLLY
Don’t worry about it...chica.
What?

AMY

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
A 70’s muscle car rolls up in front of them. The window rolls
down...revealing JARED in the driver’s seat. He is THRILLED.
JARED
All aboard the SS Liiiit!
(second-guessing himself)
...as Fuck! The SS Lit as Fuck!
MOLLY
Jesus Christ.
JARED
I am so glad you called! Sorry it
took me so long, traffic was NERTS-He scrambles out of the car as Amy glares at Molly.

(CONTINUED)

31.
CONTINUED:
AMY
This car is like Guy Fieri’s wet
dream.
MOLLY
It’s a means to an end, Amy...
Jared overly-suavely opens the door for Molly.
JARED
May I offer you the front, Mademoi-Molly climbs in the back.
JARED (CONT’D)
Or the back, the back’s even
better. Great air flow back there.
INT. JARED’S CAR - NIGHT
Jared gets in the driver’s seat and grins back at the girls.
JARED
Time for some nights we’ll never
remember with some friends we’ll
never forget!
MOLLY
You know where the party is, right?
JARED
Absolutely. We are headed to the
biggest, coolest grad night party.
It’s over on the west side.
He turns on the car and the audiobook for “LEAN IN” by
Sheryl Sandberg starts blasting. A beat.
JARED (CONT’D)
Oh, this is embarrassing. You
caught me. I have this thing where
I like to hear the words of
powerful women before I party to
remind myself of the respect and
awe you ladies deserve.
Molly and Amy just stare at him. An awkward beat.
JARED (CONT’D)
Let’s put something peppier on, get
this party started!

(CONTINUED)

32.
CONTINUED:
He peels out, screeching his tires.
INT. JARED’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER
The muscle car flies down the highway, MUSIC BLASTING.
Jared’s phone RINGS -- “GIGI CALLING” -- and he hits ignore.
JARED
Sorry about that.
MOLLY
Just get it. Isn’t she your
girlfriend or something?
JARED
What?! No! No way. No girlfriend
for me. I can’t pick favorites. Too
many ladies wanna lock this down.
And they don’t have the code! 2831.
That’s my pin number, actually. So
it is a code-GIGI calls again, stopping the music and saving Jared from
himself.
JARED (CONT’D)
Sorry, I’ll just-(answers it)
What’s up, Gigi?
GIGI (O.S.)
Jared, where the fuck did you go?
I left my tin of special things in
your car and I NEED IT.
JARED
Okay! We’re coming! Jeez.
He hangs up and floors it. Molly reaches under the front seat
and finds a MINTS TIN.
MOLLY
Do I want to know what a tin of
“special things” is-She opens it and it’s filled with WHITE POWDER. Molly SLAMS
the tin closed again.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Okay. Okay this is drugs. This is a
tin full of drugs.

WHAT?!

AMY

JARED
(jumps, startled)
What?!
AMY
(laughing too loudly)
Hey Jared! Jared! We’re actually
just gonna hop out up here.
What?

JARED

MOLLY
She’s kidding.
AMY
No I’m not. Our friend just texted
us that she...hit a possum with her
car. But the possum didn’t die, its
adrenaline and rage just made it
stronger and it’s chasing her and
she’s hiding and she needs help-JARED
Oh my God. What kind of possum?
Jared starts to merge right...
MOLLY
Do not get off. Keep driving.
JARED
Is she gonna be okay? Do we wanna
call her and make sure the possum-MOLLY
ENOUGH ABOUT THE POSSUM!
(a lightbulb)
Jared, you took Spanish, right?
JARED
Si si, mi bonita mujer.
Without missing a beat, Molly switches to FLUENT CHINESE.
MOLLY
It’s gonna be fine. Trust me.
Amy replies, also in FLUENT CHINESE. They’re so distracted
that they don’t realize Jared’s pulling to a stop.

(CONTINUED)

34.
CONTINUED: (2)
AMY
Don’t patronize me. What if Gigi
takes it and dies and our prints
are on the tin? Chain of custody!
Criminally negligent homicide!
MOLLY
(opening the tin)
Our prints aren’t on the powder. We
could pour it out the window-EXT. MARINA/INT. JARED’S MUSCLE CAR - NIGHT
Jared jerks the car to a full stop, jolting the girls and the
tin and sending the powder EVERYWHERE. They freeze,
horrified, as the dust literally settles all over them.
JARED
And we are here!
(seeing the mess)
Oh, shit.
AMY
What do we do what do we do what-MOLLY
Don’t move. Don’t inhale.
AMY
We’re going to jail. There are
drugs in my ORIFICES-JARED
What? No no no-- that’s not drugs.
That’s Gigi’s vitamins.
Her what?

AMY

JARED
You know, Vitamin D, B-12...Gigi
crushes them up and snorts them.
She says they work better that way.
He starts to brush it off Molly-JARED (CONT’D)
We’ll get you cleaned up on board!
Molly slaps his hand away, then realizes--

(CONTINUED)

35.
CONTINUED:
MOLLY
What do you mean “on board?”
EXT. MARINA - NIGHT
Molly and Amy follow Jared to a dock leading to a PARTY
YACHT. It looks like things are raging inside -- music PUMPS
and lights DANCE around the interior. A RED CARPET and STEPAND-REPEAT leads up to a DOORMAN guarding the entrance.
JARED
You said you wanted to go to the
best party, so I brought you to the
best party...which is my party!
He points to a SIGN above the dock-JARED (CONT’D)
Prepare to get BASHED
(realizing)
Not in like a violent way.
Completely consensual bashing.
“Prepare to Get Consensually
Bashed.” I’ll have them change
that. What do you think?
MOLLY
Are you serious?! This is YOUR
party?
JARED
You don’t know wanna go to Nick’s
lame house party. A boat is
international waters. We set our
own rules. Just come check it out.
It’s sick. The caterers said it’s
the best party they’ve ever been
to...and they worked Sasha Obama’s
Sweet 16.
Molly looks at Amy, who shrugs-AMY
We still don’t know where the other
party is. We might as well. I wanna
meet someone who met Sasha.
Molly sighs.
Fine.

MOLLY
Respect for Sasha.

(CONTINUED)

36.

She turns back to Jared, throwing her arms up-Okay.

MOLLY (CONT’D)

Jared can’t believe it.
JARED
Yeah?!
(trying not to freak out)
Let’s GO!
INT. JARED’S PARTY YACHT - NIGHT
A giddy Jared leads Molly and Amy up the stairs to the boat.
JARED
You ready? You getting excited?
They reach the top and Jared dances his way into a completely
empty boat, music echoing, tables of food left untouched.
JARED (CONT’D)
(still giddy)
Welcome to the CLUB!
Ooh, no.

AMY

JARED
We’re on a boat right now! What’s
up with that?
MOLLY
There’s not a soul here, Amy.
Molly passes a table of GIFT BAGS with Jared’s photo on them.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
This is insane. He made gift bags?
(almost concerned)
There’s an iPad in here!
JARED
(appearing behind him)
Pre-loaded with photos of our best
high school memories! Class of 2019
SAY WHAT! Champagne?
He takes them on a tour of the boat--

(CONTINUED)

37.

JARED (CONT’D)
There’s also a masseuse in the
back, male or female, and a photo
booth, gambling over there...
They hear a feral ROAR and suddenly GIGI is sprinting toward
them, grabbing onto and squeezing Molly and Amy WAY TOO HARD.
GIGI
I’M SO HAPPY YOU GUYS ARE HERE! I
knew you guys partied. I told
Jared, those guys seem quiet but
they’re probably spending every
weekend at like, a sex dungeon.
She jokingly bites Amy’s arm. Amy laughs a little, terrified.
Then Gigi GASPS-GIGI (CONT’D)
Oooh try one of these STRAWBERRIES!
She grabs a plate of strawberries and shoves it at them so
forcefully they just take it and eat it.
AMY
This is pretty good-WAIT.

GIGI

She grabs Amy’s hair and starts sniffing it, then SUCKING IT.
GIGI (CONT’D)
You taste like my vitamins! I love
you. You’re coming with me. DANCE
PARTY UPSTAIRS!
Gigi grabs Amy’s hand and drags her away. Amy shoots Molly a
“help me” look as Jared tries to get back to the tour-JARED
Wanna put our names on the list for
the masseuse? Or a VR experience?
Look what I found!
He puts a customized “Molly” hat on her head.
JARED (CONT’D)
You look amazing.
A WAITER walks up, desperate to give somebody food--

APPETIZERS WAITER
Buffalo chicken spring roll?

all this food, I have free alcohol,
drugs... I don’t even do drugs, but
other people will.
SECOND APPETIZER WAITER
Portabella slider?
Jared takes two. Molly gestures around the room-MOLLY
Dude, this doesn’t work. You
can’t...buy people’s affection.
JARED
I’m pretty sure you can. I’ve seen
it a lot. My parents did. Their
parents did.
MOLLY
Just-- stop trying so hard. It’s
embarrassing. People can sense it,
and it turns them off.
JARED
But you try hard. You try hard at
everything. That’s what I like
about you.
Molly’s startled. And suddenly self-conscious. And awkward.
JARED (CONT’D)
I just meant--

MOLLY
I’m gonna-- go-- this way.

She turns to go, running right into a THIRD WAITER-THIRD APPETIZER WAITER
Lamb meatb-MOLLY
Oh my God you guys are EVERYWHERE.
She takes a meatball and hurries away.

39.
EXT. YACHT UPPER DECK - NIGHT
Amy stands to the side as Gigi dances under the twinkling
lights like Penny Lane in Almost Famous, a joint hanging out
of her mouth. Gigi offers it to Amy-You want?

GIGI

AMY
No thank you. Not a drug person.
GIGI
Not even pot? I feel like it’ll
help you relax.
AMY
It doesn’t work for me. I ate a
legal pot brownie when Model UN
went to Amsterdam but as soon as I
got high I just cried about the
fact that one day my mom will die.
GIGI
That’s crazy! I have the exact same
thing!
Really?

AMY

GIGI
Yes! I lost my virginity in what I
thought was a park, but it turned
out to be a graveyard and now the
ghost spirits live inside my eggs,
waiting to be reborn.
AMY
That’s...not at all the same thing.
GIGI
I always felt like we were similar.
I’m really gonna miss you.
A WAITER climbs up to the deck and sees Amy and Gigi-YACHT WAITER
Hey, you guys can’t smoke up here.
Gigi turns to the Waitress, suddenly intense. And Mama-Bear
defensive of Amy.

YACHT WAITER
I said it to you. You can’t smoke.
GIGI
Don’t speak to her that way.
AMY
Is the “her” me? Cause I’m fine-GIGI
(pointing to Amy)
This is my best friend in the
fucking world-AMY
Whoa, that’s not-- she’s not-GIGI
And we’ll fucking fight you to the
DEATH.
Gigi grabs her Vodka bottle and SHATTERS IT against the side
fo the boat! Amy jumps-Oh my GOD!

AMY

YACHT WAITER
Okay. I’m calling security.
Molly climbs up to the upper deck-MOLLY
Amy, we need to get the fuck out of
here-Gigi grabs Amy and Molly’s hands as FIREWORKS start exploding
over the boat.
GIGI
There’s only one thing we can do
now. Jump.
MOLLY
No, no thank you.

What?!

AMY

They try to get away but Gigi has a killer grip on their
wrists and drags them to the side. Molly and Amy look at each
other, concerned. Jared climbs up to the deck and sees them--

JARED
What are you guys doing?
GIGI

Molly and Amy frantically try to wiggle out of her grip-MOLLY
Seriously, Gigi, I’m not jumping-One--

GIGI

AMY

Molly?
Two--

GIGI

MOLLY
(remembering)
The grip-escape move!
In one swift motion Molly and Amy use the self-defense GRIP
ESCAPE MOVE to whip their arms free just as Gigi dives off
the side. Molly and Amy tumble to the ground as they hear
Gigi’s SPLASH! Jared races to the side of the boat-JARED
Gigi! Are you okay?!
GIGI (O.S.)
I changed my mind! I wanna be back
on the boat!
MOLLY
She’s okay! BAIL! BAIL!!
Molly and Amy scramble up and race the hell out of there.
EXT. PARKING LOT - MARINA - NIGHT
Molly and Amy sprint down the dock and across the street to
the parking lot, giddy with adrenaline. When they finally
stop, out of breath, they burst out laughing. Adrenalinefueled, guttural, best-friend laughter.
MOLLY
She’s NUTS!

AMY
I think she would have killed for
us. Like I say I’d kill someone for

Oh, my God, I’m so sweaty. We have

before we get to Nick’s.
AMY
(surprised)
You still want to go to Nick’s?
You don’t?

MOLLY

AMY
We went to a party! We did it.
Let’s go home.

Amy.

MOLLY
(voice dropping)

AMY
Don’t do your lecture voice-MOLLY
(definite lecture voice)
That was not a party.
AMY
It was a party.
MOLLY
That was a detour. It was Jared’s
lame attempt to buy friends. We’re
A+ people. We need to go to an A+
party. Like this...
Molly opens her phone and pulls up more IPHONE PARTY FOOTAGE:
--The party’s bigger and rowdier...someone SLIP-N-SLIDES into
the pool...a group cooks MAC-N-CHEESE in the kitchen...a
PASSED-OUT-GUY lays in a pile of BEER CANS like an ANGEL...
The video’s interrupted when a TEXT from ALAN pops up:
“YASSSS! Address is 3831 Westchester Place.” A PIN pops up.

Oh my God Alan responded. We have

(checking her phone)
Honestly, you should call it,
because my score is...very low.
I’m too abrasive with the
drivers...
AMY
Molly, I’m gonna go home. But if
you wanna to go to Nick’s, go, just
come over after-Malala.

MOLLY

Amy stops. That’s a big deal.
AMY
Whoa. Seriously?
MOLLY
I’m calling Malala.
AMY
You’re sure? You only get one
Malala a year.
MOLLY
I’m calling it. I need your full

Amy takes a deep breath.
AMY
Okay.

PRINCIPAL BROWN
You know, this is a great way to
supplement the old income.
Teacher’s salaries and all...
MOLLY
It’s so terrible.

AMY
They’re a disgrace.

PRINCIPAL BROWN
And I’m working on a book and I can
think about it while I’m driving so
it’s like getting paid to write-HONNNNNK. Principal Brown lays on the horn-PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D)
HEY YOU DUMB SON OF A BITCH! CHOOSE
A LANE!
Molly and Amy grip hands, stunned, as Principal Brown snaps
back to total pleasantness-PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D)
Sorry about that. That guy was
nuts. This town, man. Lotta angry
people in this town.
He smiles and drives for a very awkward beat, until-PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D)
You guys want some music?
Yes! Genius.

MOLLY

AMY
Please! Please.

He puts on the radio VERY LOUDLY. Amy and Molly slide down
into their seats for a little privacy. Amy checks her watch-AMY (CONT’D)
We’re gonna get to Nick’s so late.

MOLLY
Everyone shows up to parties late.
It’s cooler to be late. We’ll get
there right at the crest and before
you know it you’ll be neck-deep in
Ryan.
AMY
Neck-deep in what direction?!
MOLLY
You tell me.
AMY
I don’t know! I don’t know
anything. This is like your
nightmare about having to land that
commercial airliner but much, much
worse.
MOLLY
Is it worse? Because I had the
lives of a hundred people in my
hands. My crew was counting on me.
I was their Sully.
AMY
I’m very stressed about this!
MOLLY
Okay! I know you are.
(then)
If only there was, like, a video of
people hooking up and having sex we
could watch...
AMY
I’m sorry, are you talking about
porn?
MOLLY
All I’m saying-No.

AMY

MOLLY
It’s not like anyone would know if
you watched one porn one time.
Think of it as a documentary. It’s
just a sexy documentary. It’s a hot
doc.

AMY
Every woman in it is like a
European trafficking victim!
MOLLY
Are you judging other people’s
sexual preferences? Because you
fuck a panda every night...
AMY
(angry whisper)
Fuck a panda! You’re soooo funny-MOLLY
You’re gonna sit here and judge me
for dabbling in pornography. I
thought you were a sex positive
feminist!
Molly takes out her phone.
AMY
Are you insane? Principal Brown is
four feet away from us.
MOLLY
I have headphones!
She puts an earbud in Amy’s ear. Amy sighs-AMY
Fine. But once we get a sense of
the mechanics I’m shutting it off.
MOLLY
Of course. This is for educational
purposes.
She hits play.
They’re both immediately very drawn to whatever’s happening
on screen. They stare, mesmerized. A long moment. Amy pokes
Molly without tearing her eyes away-AMY
Plug in, your phone’s gonna die.
Molly clears her throat.
MOLLY
Um, Principal Brown?

PRINCIPAL BROWN
No, I don’t.

I’ve got like thirteen!
He tosses her the largest dongle she’s ever seen. She finds
her cord and plugs it in. Amy hasn’t torn her eyes away-AMY
I didn’t know you could do that
from that angle.
MOLLY
What did I miss?
AMY
Scrub back. This is important.
Principal Brown notices them watching something.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Oh, you wanna listen to your music?
I can just plug it in up here...
Molly and Amy realize too late what button he’s reaching for-NO!!

MOLLY

DON’T DO TH--

AMY

The most intense porn sounds blast over his speakers. Wet
slaps and moans and squeaks-Molly and Amy SCREAM, HORRIFIED. Principal Brown SCREAMS,
terrified. Molly drops the phone and she and Amy scramble to
find it and unplug it-They finally unplug it and the noises stop. They all sit
there, frozen. A long beat.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Was that Cardi B?

EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly and Amy hurry out of the car. They hold on to each
other but can’t make eye contact as they scramble away-MOLLY
I cannot. Believe. That
happened. I’m gonna die. I
might die.

AMY
Oh my God. Oh my god. Oh my
God. I can’t believe you made
me do that. You’re the devil.

Then they take in the house: it’s enormous. Most of the
lights are off and it’s quiet. Amy looks around-AMY (CONT’D)
You’re sure this is the address?
MOLLY
Yeah. Maybe the pool’s in the back?
AMY
It doesn’t sound like a party. What
if this is a trap? What if a
predator stole Alan’s phone and
sent that text to all the girls in
his contacts hoping someone would
just show up?
Suddenly a STUDENT dressed as a BUTLER opens the door.
Jesus-Come in.

AMY (CONT’D)
BUTLER

Molly and Amy share a look, but go inside.
INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
They walk inside the main foyer. At the top of the staircase,
two FRESHMAN STAGEHANDS hold giant feather fans. They pull
them back to reveal Alan perched in a silk pink CLAMSHELL
made by the theater department. He’s in FULL DRAG. Alan holds
a hand to his face and lets out a WAIL.
MOLLY
What the fuck...
ALAN
He’s dead! He’s DEAD!

(CONTINUED)

49.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Who’s dead?!
ALAN
My husband’s been killed!
Alan tries to descend the stairs but one of the Stagehands is
standing on his train. George storms in.
GEORGE
Alan, you don’t have to do your
entrance every time someone
arrives!
(then, seeing the girls)
What are you guys doing here?
MOLLY
WHAT IS GOING ON?
GEORGE
It’s a murder mystery party. I’ve
been prepping for months.
Molly looks around, realizing-MOLLY
Wait, this is your house?
(then)
Alan! I was VERY clear in my text!
We’re looking for Nick’s party-ALAN
There’s been a Killing in Times
Square! Robert was an esteemed
Broadway director and the love of
my life and he’s been killed like a
dog in the street!
MOLLY
That sounds very tragic, but
there’s been a mistake. We’re
trying to get to Nick’s party. We
can’t find the address. Do you know
where it is?
ALAN
I don’t know a Nick! I only know
sorrow and GRIEF.
GEORGE
You’re at a ten and I need you at a
two!

(CONTINUED)

50.
CONTINUED: (2)
Alan glares at him, then floats off.
ALAN
I have a wake to plan!
George turns to Molly and Amy.
(then, to Molly and Amy)
If you’re here you may as well take
some of the extra characters.
He pulls them over to a TABLE where an ASSISTANT hands him
two CHARACTER PACKETS and NAME TAGS.
MOLLY
No, we don’t need characters, we’re
not staying-He hands one to Amy-GEORGE
“Adorable farmer new to the city.”
Thank you.

AMY

GEORGE
(pinning one on Molly)
And “hideous, barren orthodontist.”
MOLLY
What?! Why am I barren?
AMY
Am I here to farm? Or have I given
up that life?
MOLLY
(reading the packet)
This just says orthodontist.
GEORGE
Your backstories are in those
packets.
MOLLY
Seriously, we have to go. We’re
trying to find Nick’s party.
GEORGE
Is that the party where someone ate
a ghost pepper?

(CONTINUED)

51.
CONTINUED: (3)
Yes!

MOLLY

GEORGE
Somebody here came from that party
I think. Maybe the Mayor?
(shooing them)
Go. Immerse yourselves. Review your
histories in the parlor.
Molly grabs Amy and drags her into the parlor.
INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
A DOZEN DRAMA KIDS in varying levels of costume speak
theatrically with each other. Molly scans the room as Amy
opens her envelope to read her backstory-AMY
Oh my God. I came to the city to
hide my pregnancy from my very
religious parents!
(scrutinizing the room)
I wonder who the father is.
They see a theater kid sprawled on the floor, “dead,” as a
GIRL genuinely WEEPS over him, moaning. Amy’s impressed-AMY (CONT’D)
She’s really good.
The weeping girl looks up-- it’s Gigi. Gigi immediately stops
crying and brightens-GIGI
Oh my god you guys are here!
Molly and Amy SCREAM.
AMY
What the fuck?!

MOLLY
What-- how did you get here?

GIGI
How did you get here?
AMY
And how are you dry?
GIGI
How are you dry?

(CONTINUED)

52.
CONTINUED:
GEORGE
(walking by, to the BODY)
Aaron, I can see you breathing.
(to Gigi, “directing”)
Gigi, mmm...dig deeper.
Gigi goes back to SOBBING over the body. Molly and Amy keep
walking, so confused. They push open a door revealing-GEORGE’S MOM, DAD and 10 YEAR-OLD SISTER doing a PUZZLE in
the kitchen. George’s Mom looks up.
GEORGE’S MOM
Oh, is it over?
GEORGE
(walking by)
Mom DO NOT TALK TO THE ACTORS! The
house is mine until 11pm!!
His sister gives him a look-GEORGE (CONT’D)
I swear to fucking God Cindy...
Molly and Amy hurry out of the kitchen, running directly into
Gigi, waiting for them with a smile.
Oh my GOD.

MOLLY

AMY
Jesus CHRIST, Gigi!

GIGI
Guys, the re-election’s coming up
and I need to know if I have to buy
your votes.
AMY
Re-election-MOLLY
Wait, you’re the mayor? You know
where Nick’s party is?
GIGI
Of course I do. I know where all
the parties are.
MOLLY
Where is it?!
GIGI
Come to my office.

(CONTINUED)

53.
CONTINUED: (2)
She pulls them to a nook BEHIND A CURTAIN and lights herself
with a FLASHLIGHT. She lowers her voice.
GIGI (CONT’D)
You can’t tell anyone, okay?
We won’t.

AMY

GIGI
Not even each other.
...Okay.

MOLLY

GIGI
Nick’s party is...
(a dramatic pause)
At his aunt’s house.
MOLLY
WE KNOW IT’S AT HIS-- Oh my god.
Amy, we have to go.
GIGI
By the way, I’m very impressed at
how well you’re holding it together.
AMY
What do you mean?
GIGI
I thought the strawberries would’ve
hit by now.
MOLLY
Why would strawberries hit us?
GIGI
Because they were dipped in such an
unbelievably potent drug. It’s like
Ayahuasca, but Asian. Asiahuasca.
(then)
I told you guys that, right?
Molly turns back to Amy -- but Amy’s eyes are wide as
saucers, brimming with tears.
AMY
My mom’s already 52.
No.

MOLLY

(CONTINUED)

54.
CONTINUED: (3)
AMY
She’s closer to being 100 than she
is to being born.
MOLLY
No no no no.
Molly grabs Amy and pulls her UP THE STAIRS and into George’s
SISTER’S BEDROOM.
INT. GEORGE’S SISTER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
It’s a classic GIRL’S ROOM -- everything is COMPLETELY PINK.
DOLLS and TOYS and PINK BOOKS line the shelves.
AMY
My mom has a scarf that color.
MOLLY
Listen to me.
AMY
Once I threw up and my mom caught
it in her hands cause she loves me.
MOLLY
We’re gonna be fine. We are
healthy, nubile young women and we
just need to stay calm and we’re
gonna be fiiiiiiiii-They both PASS OUT.
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Downstairs, George is settling everyone in to dinner when
they hear the THUMP from upstairs. Annoyed, he rings his
DINNER BELL for a very passive-aggressively amount of time.
INT. GEORGE’S SISTER’S ROOM - NIGHT
MOLLY’S POV: she’s flat on the floor. Everything looks huge.
She sits up and sees her PLASTIC HAND-MOLLY
What? What the fuck? What the fuck?
What is happening...

(CONTINUED)

55.
CONTINUED:
She turns and sees that Amy’s become a BLONDE “SEXY FARMER”
DOLL. Molly SCREAMS. Then Amy screams when she sees that
Molly’s become a BRUNETTE “SEXY NURSE” DOLL.
DOLL MOLLY
Why do you look like that?!
DOLL AMY
Molly, you’re a fucking DOLL.
DOLL MOLLY
No, you’re a fucking doll!
Doll Amy notices a CORN COB attached to her hand.
DOLL AMY
What? What is this?!
She pulls it off with a painful THWOP-DOLL AMY (CONT’D)
OWWW! FUCK that hurt!
Doll Amy tries to stand but she falls over.
DOLL AMY (CONT’D)
I can’t hold my top up! My boobs
are too heavy! I have no core!
Doll Molly tries to stand but she falls over, too-DOLL MOLLY
Our legs don’t bend! They’re twice
as long as our torsos! These
proportions are insane! Where’s my
chub?!
She notices a VANITY with a set of drawers and a big MIRROR
on top and awkwardly protractor-walks toward it-DOLL AMY
Wait where are you going?!
DOLL MOLLY
I have to see for myself!
Doll Amy follows, waddling awkwardly behind her-DOLL AMY
Wait for me!

(CONTINUED)

56.
CONTINUED: (2)
Doll Molly starts climbing the drawers by inch-worming her
legs -- spreading them in a split and then squeezing them
back together to propel up. Doll Amy copies her.
Doll Molly grunts and pulls herself to the top-DOLL MOLLY
Okay well I’ve never done splits in
my life! Legs aren’t supposed to
bend like this!
Doll Amy gets to the highest drawer-- then SLIPS and falls!
AHHHHH!
AMY!!!

DOLL AMY
DOLL MOLLY

Doll Molly races to the edge and sees that Doll Amy’s holding
on to the edge of the highest drawer!
DOLL AMY
Help! Help Molly!
DOLL MOLLY
Don’t look down Amy! No!
Doll Molly tries to reach her hand down to Doll Amy-DOLL AMY
I can’t reach!
Doll Molly drops her way-too-long leg down to Doll Amy-- then
sees the HOLE in Amy’s hand (from the corn cob)-DOLL MOLLY
You have to put my heel in your
hole.
DOLL AMY
What? What?!
DOLL MOLLY
PUT MY HEEL IN YOUR HOLE!
DOLL AMY
What hole?!
DOLL MOLLY
YOUR CORN HOLE!

(CONTINUED)

57.
CONTINUED: (3)
And SHOVES her hand hole onto the heel of the stiletto with
another painful THWOP! She YELPS in pain as Doll Molly swings
her leg around, dropping Doll Amy to safety. They climb to
their feet and finally see themselves in the mirror-Oh my GOD.

DOLL AMY

DOLL MOLLY
What the fuck am I wearing?!
They rips off their CLOTHES, looking down-DOLL MOLLY (CONT’D)
WHERE’S MY VAG?
DOLL AMY
Molly I have no genitals.
DOLL MOLLY
How do I pee? How do I shit?!
DOLL AMY
I don’t even have nipples! These
are just mounds! My whole body’s
like a fucking dolphin!
(getting into it)
Just perfect, round, huge mounds.
Molly, look at my body. I’m
beautiful.
DOLL MOLLY
Amy, no. Don’t get sucked in. This
is our nightmare-DOLL AMY
(admiring herself)
I know this is unrealistic and bad
for women but...is it bad? Because
I feel pretty good.
Amy turns to admire her ass-DOLL AMY (CONT’D)
I mean this ass won’t quit.
DOLL MOLLY
AMY! USE YOUR BRAIN!
DOLL AMY
I don’t need to use my brain.

Doll Amy slowly raises her leg parallel to her body, feeling
her crotch-DOLL AMY (CONT’D)
I just need to be smooth and
flexible.
She pops up and starts to cat-walk-DOLL AMY (CONT’D)
Look at you, you bad bitch. My my
my. Mmmmm.
DOLL MOLLY
Oh my God we have to WAKE UP!
Doll Molly SMASHES her doll-head against the mirror,
shattering the glass. Doll Amy turns to Molly, flipping her
hair-DOLL AMY
I actually think I might, like,
stay here for a while?
Doll Molly scurries over to her.
DOLL MOLLY
NO! I won’t let you do this. We
have to get the drug out of our
systems-Doll Molly tries to get her hand into Doll Amy’s mouth, but
Doll Amy slaps her hands away.
Stop it!

DOLL AMY

They start slapping at each other as Doll Molly keeps tries
to shove her hand in Doll Amy’s mouth-DOLL MOLLY
You need to throw up!
DOLL AMY
(fighting her off)
Let! Me! Have! This! Body!
They get into a full-on slap fight and don’t notice how close
they are to the edge of the dresser and as they keep fighting
they SLIP AND FALL OFF!

59.
INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Alan and the rest of the Murder Mystery participants are
sitting around a grand DINING ROOM TABLE for dinner.
GEORGE
Now that our amuse bouche of baconwrapped dates is over, why don’t we
play a rousing round of “J’ACUSSE!”
Suddenly they hear a CRASH-- and then see a still super-high
Molly and Amy walk past, not bending their arms or legs, like
dolls. It’s like they’re in stiff slow motion. The group
watches, bewildered, as Molly and Amy doll-walk outside.
Molly stops at the door and turns to the table:
MOLLY
Fuck you George.
They doll-walk outside.
ALAN
Who is she supposed to be?
GEORGE
The orthodontist.
EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
Molly and Amy lay on the lawn, finally coming down. Amy puts
one hand under her bra and another down her pants.
AMY
We’re okay. We’re okay! And we did
it. We went to two parties, we
accidentally did drugs-- we can say
we went out. Let’s go home.
Molly sits up.
MOLLY
What? No. We have to stick to the
plan. The plan is to go to Nick’s.
AMY
Dude, nothing has gone according to
plan tonight.
MOLLY
Which is why we have to STICK to
the plan. We’ll call another Lyft--

(CONTINUED)

60.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Why are you being so pushy?
MOLLY
Honestly, pushy is a compliment.
You know who else is pushy? Diane
Sawyer. My girl Joan of Arc. Queen
Noor of Jordan-AMY
(defensive)
I know where Queen Noor is from!
MOLLY
Once we get to Nick’s, all of this
will be worth it-AMY
Forget about Nick’s! No one will
even tell us where it is. Why are
you so obsessed with his party?
GIGI (O.S.)
Because she loves him.
Molly and Amy JUMP-- Gigi’s standing out on the SECOND FLOOR
BALCONY, looking over them.
MOLLY
Oh my God, Gigi, STOP DOING THAT.
AMY
What did you say?
GIGI
Molly loves Nick.
Molly scoffs but her face goes BRIGHT red as she stammers-MOLLY
Can you please stop repeating that
sentence? Because it’s not true.
AMY
Molly hates Nick.
Thank you.

MOLLY

GIGI
She projects disgust to cover up a
deep desire. How many times a day
does she bring him up?

(CONTINUED)

61.
CONTINUED: (2)
AMY
She brings him up to complain-GIGI
That’s still talking about him.
Look, the auras are very clear. I
don’t write them. I just read them.
MOLLY
No. No. Nope. You just drugged us
and tried to throw us off a boat,
so nothing you say is of any value
to us.
Gigi flips Molly off.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Okay, you can stop flipping me off,
because YOU should flip off.
So...shut the fuck up.
Alan bursts outside the front door, looking for Gigi-ALAN
Madame Mayor! What are you doing
out here?
(sotto)
George locked himself in the
closet.
He spins on his toes and floats back inside with Gigi as Amy
turns to Molly, who’s very flustered. Amy realizes-Dude.
No.
Dude...?

AMY
MOLLY
AMY

Molly finally turns to her.
MOLLY
No! I don’t like him. Yes, maybe
he’s classically, traditionally
handsome, and weirdly charming, so
maybe my innate biology registers
him as an ideal mate. And yes,
maybe I occasionally fantasize
about him sweeping me off my feet.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

62.
CONTINUED: (3)

MOLLY (CONT'D)
And some weaker people might call
that a tiny crush but I can fight
against it, I can ignore it because
we all have weird interests and all
that matters is that we shove them
down and never think of them again.

Amy just looks at her friend. She gives her a small smile.
AMY
You don’t have to shut anything
down.
MOLLY
Yes I do. Because I can’t like him.
Maybe my body likes him but my mind
knows that’s stupid, because he’s a
jock who only cares about being
cool and having fun and he doesn’t
even look at girls unless they look
like Triple A and he doesn’t even
want people like me at his parties
because I’m a butterpersonality.
Amy slaps Molly across the face.
AMY
How dare you say that about my best
friend.
MOLLY
WHAT the FUCK-AMY
If you ever say anything like that
about yourself again I will fucking
lay you out. You are the smartest,
strongest, coolest, most stunningly
gorgeous creature this high school
and this earth has ever seen and
Nick would be lucky to be a
footnote in your story. And we are
going to his party.
Molly’s amazed-MOLLY
Are you serious?
AMY
I’m dead serious. If Nick’s what
you want, that’s what you deserve.

(CONTINUED)

63.
CONTINUED: (4)
She stands.
MOLLY
How? How are we gonna find out
where the party is?
AMY
By doing what we do best.
(dramatically)
Motherfucking homework.
A kickass HIP HOP SONG starts as we CUT TO...
INT. UCLA COLLEGE LIBRARY - NIGHT
Molly and Amy stride into the UCLA library like they fucking
own the place.
INT. THE STACKS - UCLA COLLEGE LIBRARY - NIGHT
--Molly and Amy slam their bags down at their usual table,
stretching their knuckles like they’re about to play Mozart.
--Molly runs her fingers along a list of REAL ESTATE
PURCHASES by people with the last name “Howland.”
-- Amy makes notations on a huge MAP.
--Molly reads a book of CITY RECORDS as a COLLEGE COUPLE has
loud, gross sex behind her.
-- They watch a new SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO: Theo’s preparing to
KARATE CHOP a stack of 15 PIZZA BOXES.
AMY
Wait, look.
She zooms in on the STACK of pizza boxes.
AMY (CONT’D)
That’s at least 15 pizza boxes. How
many orders that big could Lido’s
have filled tonight?
MOLLY
(realizing)
Genius...

64.
INT. PIZZA DELIVERY CAR - NIGHT
PAT, the LIDO’S DELIVERY GUY, gets in the front seat holding
two PIES. He’s grumbling to himself-PAT
Two half-cheese, half-sausage
pizzas are just one cheese and one
sausage pizza you fucking morons-Amy and Molly rise from the backseat like it’s a carjacking.
They’ve tied their hair into ponytails in front of their
faces, like a makeshift mask.
MOLLY
EVERYBODY STAY CALM!

DON’T MOVE!

AMY

Pat SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.
PAT
WHAT THE FUCK?! What the fuck?!
What the fuck is this?!
MOLLY
WE ASK THE QUESTIONS!
PAT
Oh my God oh my God is this some
kind of Manson family bullshit?
AMY
No! No! Everything is gonna be just
fine, you’re just gonna give us the
address where you delivered pizza
earlier tonight!
A beat.
PAT
I’m sorry, are you guys out of your
fucking minds? How old are you?
MOLLY
(lowest possible voice)
Does not matter!
PAT
Okay, that did not make you sound
older. So you’re basically children
and you willingly got into a
strange man’s car. Do you even have
a weapon?

(CONTINUED)

65.

Molly and Amy exchange a glance.
...Yes?

MOLLY

AMY
(whispered)
If we claim to have a weapon this
might be a felony.
Fuck.

MOLLY

PAT
So you’re wearing your hair as a
mask and you tried to rob someone
without a weapon?
He pulls a GUN from the glove compartment.
PAT (CONT’D)
Because I do have a weapon!
The girls SCREAM and duck-MOLLY
Why do you have a gun?!
PAT
To protect myself from bad people!
Something you should be thinking
about! Did sexual assault play into
your planning at all?
MOLLY
(admitting)
Not really.
PAT
I could’ve just locked the doors
and driven off! I could’ve made you
my play things!
Amy holds up her phone, frozen on the PARTY FOOTAGE:
AMY
Just please give us the address
where you delivered this huge order
earlier tonight.

(CONTINUED)

66.

PAT
Fine. But only because I’m afraid
if I don’t some dog walker will
find your bodies tomorrow morning.
He finds the address on his phone and holds it up so Molly
can type the address into hers. As she opens her phone-PAT (CONT’D)
Don’t let me see your passcode.
Jesus Christ.
MOLLY
Thank you.
(then)
Since we’re already in the car,
could you maybe...drive us there?
PAT
Sure, buckle up.
The girls start to buckle their seatbelts.
PAT (CONT’D)
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY CAR.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
The Lido’s car zooms away as Molly and Amy celebrate-MOLLY
You were incredible! So scary!
AMY
If you wanted to be a criminal you
would be the best fucking criminal
in Los Angeles. Now let’s call a
chariot to...
Her face falls. She feels her pockets.
AMY (CONT’D)
FUCK. I left my phone in his car!
Why did I have to use a visual aid!

PORN. CALL A LYFT!!!
MOLLY
But then if my phone dies and the
driver can’t find us we’re fucked!

Suddenly she gets a lightbulb and frantically dials a number.
AMY
What? Who are you calling?
MOLLY
Pick up pick up pick up-(rapid fast)
Hi it’s Molly and Amy we need help
we’re stranded on Ventura and Lemon
can you pick us up please we need-(a beat, then)
It died. Cross your fingers.
For what?

AMY

EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER
Molly and Amy sit on the curb, waiting, nervous.
AMY
We could hitchhike.
MOLLY
Are you aching to be murdered?
AMY
I’m just throwing out suggestions.
The Subaru squeals up to the girls. The DRIVER gets out but
the headlights are too bright to see who it is. She walks
around the car, finally revealing...
Miss Fine. She smiles and waves.
MISS FINE
You girls need a ride?
The girls SQUEAL and sprint to her car.

68.
INT. MISS FINE’S CAR - NIGHT
Molly and Amy ride in the back as Miss Fine drives. They’re
completely giddy.
AMY
Thank you so much, Miss Fine. You
totally saved us.
MISS FINE
Please, you two saved me from rewatching Gilmore Girls. I’ve seen
it like fifty times.
(then)
Now what is this address I’m taking
you?
MOLLY
Nick’s aunt’s house. It’s
a...party, technically.
MISS FINE
Wait. You want me to drive you to
an unsupervised house party?
Molly and Amy freeze.
MISS FINE (CONT’D)
Good! I’m glad you guys are having
a little fun before graduation.
Really?

AMY

MISS FINE
Yes! I don’t want you guys to make
the same mistakes I did.
AMY
What do you mean?
MISS FINE
I spent the majority of my 20’s
overcompensating for the fact that
I never had fun in high school. And
then the pendulum swung way too far
in the other direction. I went
crazy. I had some really dark
moments there in my twenties. Some
really dark moments.
(remembering)
Like, it was bad. Did you know I’m
banned from Jamba Juice?
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

69.

MISS FINE (CONT'D)
Not a single Jamba Juice. Every
Jamba Juice. That came down from
corporate. Do you know how many
Jamba Juices there are in this
country? Like a bajillion. It’s a
national chain. It’s a sensation.
(then)
I don’t want that for you. You
still have a chance. I want you two
to go to this party and I want you
to have fun. Because tonight is
your NIGHT!
YES!
Yes!
Yes.

MOLLY
AMY
MOLLY

MISS FINE
Now what are you wearing?
AMY
This. This look.
MISS FINE
You know you’re matching, right?
AMY
(re: Molly’s scarf)
Well we added an embellishment...
MISS FINE
Lucky for you two I’m a 30-year old
single woman. Which means I’ve got
a lot of shit in my car. Why don’t
you go through some of those bags?
MOLLY
I’m sorry, we can touch your
clothes?
MISS FINE
Please. Please touch my clothes.
Please change your clothes.
Molly closes her eyes in ecstasy.
MOLLY
This night...

70.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
The car stops down the street from an obvious PARTY HOUSE.
Molly and Amy step out of the car in brand new outfits-cool, stylish, colorful dresses. They fawn over each other-MOLLY
Ummmmm...I have no breath?

AMY
Hmmmmmmm...WHAT?

MOLLY
I have nowhere to go with this.
It’s too perfect.
AMY
You’re literally glowing.
MOLLY
You’ve just come out of the water,
you’re a mermaid...
AMY
How are you so fucking shiny?
Miss Fine watches, alarmed.
MOLLY
Can you fetch me my inhaler? Cause
I CAN’T BREATHE-AMY
My eyes! My eyes hurt so bad from
your beauty!
MISS FINE
Excuse me, ladies? There’s a party
to go to...
Molly and Amy laugh, sheepish and delighted.
MISS FINE (CONT’D)
I’ll see you two inside.
Molly and Amy glance at each other-- but then Miss Fine
laughs like she’s kidding. They laugh, too.
MISS FINE (CONT’D)
I’m kidding. Can you imagine?
That’d be weird, right? It’d be
weird. Anyway. See y’all later!

71.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Molly and Amy nervously walk up to the party. Music THUMPS
from inside, getting louder as they get closer. They reach
the front door, give each other encouraging smiles, and clasp
hands.
Love you.
Love you.

MOLLY
AMY

They push the door open...
INT. NICK’S AUNT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
It’s exactly what you’d hope a high school party would be -throbbing with sweaty, horny, giddy TEENAGERS. Everybody’s
high off of the year ending and emotional about it being
over. People play drinking games, laugh and squeal with each
other, dance on couches.
Molly peers through the crowd and finds Nick across the room.
He’s having fun with his friends.
But then his eyes wander and he locks eyes with...Molly.
We PUSH IN on Molly as she feels the spark-Then we PUSH IN on Nick as he realizes he’s been waiting for
a girl who challenges him mentally and emotionally-And when we pull back out, the rest of the party has
DISAPPEARED. Nick walks toward Molly and reaches out his
hand. She takes it and they burst into AMAZING CHOREOGRAPHY.
It’s unbelievably romantic. They can’t take their eyes off
each other as they dance like old-school movie stars. Nick
dips her and they’re about to kiss and when he grabs a BEER
CAN and CRUSHES it against his forehead-INT. NICK’S AUNT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly’s jolted back to reality as the real Nick crushes a
BEER CAN on his forehead across the room. Suddenly a RANDOM
PARTIER walking by spots Molly and Amy and stops-RANDOM PARTIER
Whoooa! You two?!

(CONTINUED)

Molly and Amy brace themselves to be made fun of...but then
the whole room CHEERS! A few people TOAST their beers.
Somebody offers HIGH-FIVES. Tanner walks by-TANNER
El Presidente!

The protest lady!
Everyone’s happy to see them. The girls are surprised. Molly
peers around Tanner to find Nick, but he’s gone.
TANNER
Welcome my little turtledoves! I’m
so happy you guys are here! You
want a drink? Smoke? Drink? You
guys want a drink, you come to me,
‘cause you guys are the best,
honestly you freaked me out but I’m
gonna miss you, cause class of ‘19
for-fucking-ever.
Everybody CHEERS again. Molly and Amy share a happy smile.
INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NICK'S AUNT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly and Amy make their way through the party, dancing a
little. They’re having fun. Then Molly’s eyes go wide-RYAN!

MOLLY

She grabs Amy and points to the KITCHEN, where Ryan’s
laughing with some SKATER FRIENDS. She looks beautiful.
AMY
Look how nice her skin looks.
MOLLY
Go get her.
AMY
She’s busy, she’s with her friends-MOLLY
Amy! You can do this. Think of
those perfect breasts in that bra
just waiting to be freed. And her
nipples, like two sparkling plastic
panda eyes--

AMY
Okay! Okay.
(gesturing over at Nick)
Good luck. To any woman trying to
sexually please Nick after tonight,
because you’re about to set the bar
WAY too high.
They high-five, hug and Amy starts walking toward the
kitchen. Molly turns back to the bar and Tanner hands her a
drink-- just as Gigi rises from below the bar-GIGI
Tanner we’re out of sugar cubes.
NO.
Yep.

MOLLY
GIGI

MOLLY
No. Nope. No. Not possible. How?!
How are you here?!

I missed you. I’m gonna go

INT. KITCHEN - NICK’S AUNT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ryan pours Amy a drink.
RYAN
Dude! I’m so stoked you’re here.
I’ve always wanted you to come out.
Amy’s stunned. Is this is her moment?
AMY
I am out. I came out in 10th grade.

(CONTINUED)

74.
CONTINUED:
Ryan’s confused, then laughs-RYAN
No, I mean, like, come out on a
weekend. Hang out.
Amy blushes so deeply she may pass out.
AMY
Me too. That’s what I meant, also.
RYAN
You gotta have a little fun before
you leave for Africa.
AMY
(touched)
You remembered I’m going to Africa?
RYAN
Yeah. Uganda or something, right?
AMY
Botswana. They’d kill me in Uganda.
Why?

RYAN

AMY
Oh. Cause that country’s not really
a fan of gay people.
(awkwardly fishing)
So...would you be afraid to go to
Uganda too?
They’re suddenly distracted as Gigi marches by, directing-GIGI
Karaoke in the guest room!
Ryan grabs Amy’s hand and starts pulling her down the hall-RYAN
You wanna do karaoke?
Amy glances down at her hand, thrilled.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NICK’S AUNT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly’s still hovering in the corner, watching Nick play BEER
PONG. She takes a deep breath and walks over to him. When
Nick notices her, he jumps to his feet, amazed--

NICK
Holyyyy SHIT. MOLLY’S HERE?!
He’s a little drunk and genuinely delighted to see her.
NICK (CONT’D)
Are you really here? Is this a
mirage? Did I get President Molly
to come out on a weekend?
MOLLY
(blushing, rolls her eyes)
It’s a purely ceremonial visit.
Nick laughs, then brings her to the table.
NICK
Okay, sit down. Sit right here.
Right next to me. Student Council
ticket versus those douchebags.
I’ve been waiting for this since
like second grade.
He starts arranging the beer pong cups. Molly tries to hide
her grin as she attempts to help.
INT. GUEST ROOM - NICK’S AUNT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
George stands dramatically with the karaoke microphone.
GEORGE
This song goes out to my cast.
He starts singing Alanis Morissette’s “YOU OUGHTA KNOW.”
They’ve projected the LYRICS onto the wall with Nick’s Aunt’s
old projector. George sings VERY emotionally as Gigi watches,
aroused. Amy and Ryan laugh at George, whispering to each
other. At one point Ryan flings her arm across Amy’s thigh.
Amy tries to stay calm but she can’t hide a beaming grin.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
You-- You-- You OUGHTTA KNOW! ALAN!
He collapses as Gigi comforts him. The mic is free, and Ryan
grabs Amy, trying to pull her onstage-RYAN
Okay, your turn! You gotta sing!
Amy protests, but Ryan forces the mic into her hand--

(CONTINUED)

76.
CONTINUED:
RYAN (CONT’D)
Let’s go, Amy! Do it for me!
Amy takes the mic, so nervous the sound starts to drop out.
But Ryan’s watching her, smiling, and so she takes a deep
breath and belts the chorus-AMY
And I’m here! To remind you! Of the
mess you left when you went away!
Amy sings her heart out, hitting every note, and it’s
beautiful. The whole room’s astonished, cheering loudly.
GEORGE
You can tell she’s not supporting,
no breath control, but it’s good!
It’s on pitch!
Amy finishes with a flourish and Ryan grabs her in a hug.
RYAN
Dude! What the fuck?! How are you
so good?
(to the room)
I KNOW HER!
Amy blushes, thrilled.

This is going better than she hoped.

game up. You need to rise to my

Nick laughs.
NICK
It’s crazy that we never hung out

you’re all work and no play, but
you’re pretty fun.
I am fun.

MOLLY

NICK
You are fun.
He grins down at her. Are they flirting?!
INT. LIVING ROOM - NICK’S AUNT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Theo approaches Miss Fine by the fireplace.
THEO
Hi Miss Fine.
Hi, Theo.

MISS FINE

He hands her a drink.
THEO
For you. I muddled the rosemary
myself.
Miss Fine takes the drink, skeptical, but her eyes go wide as
she sips it.
MISS FINE
This is amazing.
THEO

You’re amazing.
She stares at him for a beat.
MISS FINE
You’re 20, right?

He nods, mesmerized. Miss Fine downs the rest of her drink.
INT. LIVING ROOM/EXT. POOL - NIGHT
Nick throws a pong ball and misses.
MOLLY
You just need more of an arc.
NICK
It’s easy to have an arc when
you’re like three feet tall. I’m
looking straight down.
MOLLY
How tall are you?
Nick stands, grinning down at her.
NICK
How tall do you think I am?
This is the sexiest moment of Molly’s life. She stands right
next to him. A beat.

MOLLY

Nick laughs and groans, pretending he’s been shot.
NICK
My teammates aren’t usually this
mean!
MOLLY
They’re usually blonde and skinny
and not into drinking carbs?
NICK
No way. I fuck with Hufflepuffs.
Molly’s heart skips a beat.
MOLLY
Hufflepuff? Like in Harry Potter?
NICK
Yeah. You’re like a half-Ravenclaw,
half-Slytherin, right?
He might as well have undressed her.

MOLLY
(almost out of breath)
That is exactly what I am.
Nick grins down at her. Then he looks past Molly to a
COMMOTION outside and frowns.
NICK
Shit, I gotta go make sure those
idiots don’t hurt themselves.
(puts his hands on her
shoulders)
Stay right here. Don’t move. We’re
winning this game. Don’t move.
I won’t!

MOLLY

NICK
Stay right there.
He jogs outside, high-fiving people or slapping backs on the
way. Molly watches him go, giddy.
EXT. POOL - NICK'S AUNT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Amy follows Ryan outside, where people are jumping in the
pool.
Ryan shimmies off her jeans, revealing BOXER BRIEFS. She
smiles at Amy, who grins and pull off her top just as Ryan
jumps into the water. Amy takes a deep breath and CANNONBALLS
into the pool after her-INT. NICK’S POOL - NIGHT
Underwater, Amy looks for Ryan, but can’t find her in the sea
of people. She swims through the crowd.
Then she sees two pairs of legs wrapped around each other.
She freezes, staring at the legs, starting to get a really
bad feeling.
EXT. NICK’S POOL - NIGHT
Amy slowly surfaces to find...RYAN AND NICK MAKING OUT.
And with that, Amy’s heart breaks. She’s an idiot.

Fighting emotion, Amy wades to the STEPS as fast as she can.
She cannot get out fast enough. She stumbles toward the
house, sopping wet. She needs to get to Molly.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NICK'S AUNT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Amy pushes her way through the crowd, trying not to cry,
looking for Molly. She needs her friend, but she also needs
to save Molly from feeling what she’s feeling.
She finally spots her waiting patiently at the pong table.
Molly sees her and brightens, grabbing her-MOLLY
Oh my God THERE YOU ARE! How’s it
going? Did you find Ryan? Did you
go in the pool?
Molly--

AMY

MOLLY
Things are going really well over
here. Like, really well. I’m being
mean to him and it’s working and we
talked about Harry Potter and he
knows I’m a Slytherin and he seems
to like it-AMY
Molly, I think we should go home.
MOLLY
What? No, just dry off!
AMY
I just think we need to leave right
now. Seriously. Let’s go this way.
MOLLY
Are you nuts? No way. Nick’s fully
flirting with me. I think this is
gonna happen.
AMY
Molly, please. I’m asking you.
Let’s just go.
MOLLY
Just go find Ryan--

Malala.

AMY

Amy, no.

MOLLY

AMY
Are you kidding? I’ve done whatever
you wanted all night. Now I’m
calling Malala! Come with me!
MOLLY
I’m not leaving just because you’re
doing the thing you always do!
Amy’s already a raw nerve. Now she’s pissed.
AMY
What is that supposed to mean?
MOLLY
Just...you always talk a big game
but then you give up just when
things get uncomfortable. Like, you
jumped in the pool and now you’re
sad that you’re wet?
AMY
That’s bullshit!
MOLLY
If I didn’t drag you to do things-AMY
You don’t drag me, you force me to
do whatever you want to do!
Now Molly’s startled by Amy’s tone. They’re both drunk and
emotional enough to not realize how loud they’re getting. The
whole room starts to notice.
MOLLY
What does that even mean?
AMY
You decide what we do and when we
do it and that we always have to do
it together--

(CONTINUED)

82.

MOLLY
I have to decide what we do because
you never decide anything! I have
to do all the heavy lifting in this
friendship. You never take charge.
AMY
I take charge!
MOLLY
You never take charge! I always
have to push you. Without me you
wouldn’t do anything.
AMY
I’m going to go to Africa without
you!
MOLLY
I encouraged your summer abroad!
AMY
I’m not going for the summer! I’m
going for the whole year!
A beat. Molly is floored.
MOLLY
Wait, what?
AMY
I’m taking a gap year. I deferred
Columbia until next fall.
MOLLY
When did you decide that?
AMY
When I applied.
MOLLY
In January? You’ve been lying to me
since January?
AMY
Yeah, because I knew you would’ve
tried to bully me into staying!
MOLLY
But we’ll be on completely
different schedules.

That was your plan! That was never
my plan.It’s always your plan.
MOLLY
I can’t believe you. You think
going to Africa makes you tough but
you weren’t even brave enough to
tell me? You’re a fucking coward!
AMY
You’re selfish! And mean!
MOLLY
You’re a bad friend!
AMY
You’re a fucking bad friend! I
called Malala! That was a sacred
code!
MOLLY
I got the Metro North commuter pass
to visit you in New York every
weekend!
AMY
Nobody asked you to do that! Just
like nobody asked you to come to
this fucking party! Nobody invited
you! Nobody wanted you here!

Molly sputters, hurt and furious-FUCK YOU!

MOLLY

Amy flinches. And suddenly they realize -- the whole room is
watching. Half of them are filming the fight on their
phones.Amy starts to say something, but then just glares and
marches past Molly out of the room.

Amy jumps -- Hope is sitting on the toilet, smoking a joint.
HOPE (CONT’D)

I guess you didn’t.
HOPE
What’s wrong with you? Fight with
your wife?
AMY
Can you just leave me alone,
please?
HOPE
Leave me alone, I was here first.
(then)
Why are you even at a party?
Shouldn’t you be marching in some
meaningless protest somewhere? Or
in bed doing homework?
Amy’s still fired up from her fight and getting more pissed.
AMY
You don’t know me.
HOPE
I’m pretty sure I do.
AMY
No, you’re one of those people who
claims you’re “honest” or “calling
people on their shit” when you’re
really just mean.
HOPE
Wow, I take it back. You’re a
badass who takes no prisoners and
cries in the bathroom at parties.

And then AMY KISSES HOPE. Determined to prove something. Hope
is surprised...but she kisses her back.
INT. REC ROOM - NICK'S AUNT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Molly’s still seething from the fight as she waits for Nick
at their pong table. Jared walks up to her.
MOLLY
When did you get here?
JARED
Awhile ago.
MOLLY
Did you see Amy? She fucking
freaked out at me, I don’t know
what’s wrong with her-JARED
Do people really think I had sex
with a prostitute?
An awkward beat.
MOLLY
You didn’t?
JARED
No! Of course not!
(admitting)
I’ve never slept with anybody.

She hits the water like it’s concrete.
MOLLY
Gigi? The girl who jumped off your
boat? The girl gave you a prison
tat while you were asleep?
JARED
That wasn’t about me. She’s a sad
person. And she may be nuts, but
she’s the most loyal person I’ve
ever met. She once tried to shiv a
mailman because she thought he
laughed at me.
(then)
Plus, not everyone’s lucky enough
to find someone like you and Amy.
I’m just doing my best till I can
get outta here and find people who
are into the same weird shit I am.
(quickly)
Not like...sex stuff. I mean like,
airplanes and musicals.
What?

MOLLY

JARED
I wanna design airplanes. Get rich
off that. Then use the cash to
produce some new musicals. Enough
with the revivals. It’s bullshit.

I should probably make sure that’s
not an actual dead man’s float.

Are you okay?
AMY
Yeah, sorry, I just got dizzy for a
second.
HOPE
We can stop if you want.
AMY
No. We’re not stopping.
HOPE

Okay.
Hope lays down and starts to take off her jeans. Amy unties
Hope’s sneakers. They’re nervous and awkward and sweet. Amy
gets the sneakers off and tries to seductively pull Hope’s
jeans off, but they’re skinny jeans, and it’s hard, and
eventually she has to YANK them so forcefully she stumbles to
the ground. Hope laughs.
Amy pulls Hope’s underwear over her knees and off her legs.
They’re suddenly both a little shy.
AMY
I’ll take off mine, too...
Yeah.

HOPE
It’s okay...
AMY
Is there a-- is there another way
you would prefer?

Amy jerks her hand away and abruptly sits up.
HOPE
It’s okay-AMY
I’m sorry, I’m just not used to
approaching that part from that
angle, and my geometry was off and-HOPE
Seriously don’t worry about it.
Amy reaches up and grabs one of the CUPS on the counter.
Takes a quick sip of punch...liquid courage...
She realizes too late that someone has ASHED THEIR CIGARETTES

The game’s been abandoned, but Molly’s still waiting for
Nick. She finally goes to look for him. She squeezes through
people, scans the room, the kitchen-And sees Nick and Ryan kissing and flirting against the
fridge. Nick takes her hand and gives her a little twirl.
It’s like a gut punch. And then it’s even worse as she

Amy walks toward the cops, then turns back. This is her
chance to do something great.

Wait for my signal. I’m gonna

Molly walks home in the dark. She’s tired and miserable.

Molly closes the door behind her in the passenger seat. They
drive in silence for a beat.
TRIPLE A
You know this is why people say I
gave guys “roadside assistance,”
right? I gave them a ride home.
That’s all.
Molly’s stunned. A beat.
TRIPLE A (CONT’D)
Okay that’s not true I blew them.
But it wasn’t like they ran out of
gas and I showed up to suck their
dicks while they waited for help.
We hooked up in their cars. It
makes sense to hook up in a car!
I’m not gonna suck a dick in my own
home when my dad could walk in at
any moment! FUCKING SUE ME!
MOLLY
That makes a lot of sense...
Triple A’s taken caught off guard by that. A beat.
TRIPLE A
You know what the worst part is?
All the girls call me that, too. I
knew Max and Ben and Dicksplinter

hasn’t seen it since it died last night.
She rubs her eyes, then frowns when she sees -- 32 messages.
All about Amy: Is she okay? She’s our queen! Where’s Amy?!
Molly sits up and opens a link someone texted her -- it’s a
shaky SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO of Amy getting PERP WALKED from the
party into a police car.
Oh my God.

MOLLY

AMY (ON VIDEO)
All right, well. Just so you know I
know my rights. There are more
prisons than colleges in the US,
did you know that? And it costs
$71,000 to house an inmate in the
state of California. That’s more
than Harvard!

backseat)
This seems excessive. Shotgun. Just

Let’s do this.
Amy turns the key and they ZOOM OUT OF THERE.
EXT. GRADUATION FIELD - DAY
The field is packed and abuzz as people start to find seats.
SENIORS in their cap-and-gowns fidget with excitement.
Onstage, Gigi plays the piano like a savant.
Principal Brown tries to corral the students-PRINCIPAL BROWN
Okay, everybody, let’s take a seat!
A few feet away, Miss Fine sees the back of Theo’s head in a
seat. She approaches and leans in, making a seductive noise--

CONTINUED:
Rrrrrr--

MISS FINE

Theo turns -- but it’s not Theo, it’s a LONG-HAIRED GIRL.
MISS FINE (CONT’D)
Ooooh. Heeeey, Evelyn.
(then)
I just wanted to say, “have a great
summer!” Have a great...ok.
(to herself)
Cool cool cool. Sickening.
She turns-- right into the real Theo, grinning.
THEO
Morning, my queen.

Hi.

MISS FINE
(flustered)

THEO
Last night was amazing. Can I see
you again?
Miss Fine grimaces, then gives him a tiny smile.
MISS FINE
Good luck at Google next year.
She walks away. Theo’s in love. Triple A walks up, looking
between the two of them.
TRIPLE A
Did you fuck Miss Fine?
INT. JARED’S MUSCLE CAR - DAY
Amy drives like a madwoman, barely able to control the car’s
horsepower, as Molly screams in the front seat next to her.
EXT. GRADUATION FIELD - DAY
Principal Brown walks over to a group of STUDENTS.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
All right, we’ve got everybody?
Where’s Molly? I don’t know. I
haven’t seen her since a reasonable
time yesterday.

(CONTINUED)

97.
CONTINUED:
Jared steps forward.
JARED
Molly warned me she might be late
and tapped me to start her speech.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Molly Davidson’s gonna be late to
graduation? That doesn’t sound like
her.
JARED
Well, she also asked me to remind
you that...
(remembering his script)
This sort of thing happens all the
time on the Senate floor, and if a
Senator isn’t present for a vote, a
proxy can call for a motion for the
vote to take place in his or her
absence.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Okay yes that sounds like her.
(then)
So she tapped you?
JARED
She tapped me.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
(thinks, then)
Fuck it, I approve.
EXT. GRADUATION FIELD - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Jared steps up to the podium. He taps the mic, terrified.
JARED
Good morning.
In the crowd, George is ecstatic.
GEORGE
Good morning!
JARED
(reading the speech)
I’m Molly Davidson.

98.
INT. JARED’S MUSCLE CAR - DAY
Amy and Molly screech through the streets like Fast and the
Furious, having the time of their lives.
EXT. GRADUATION FIELD - DAY
Jared sweats as he keeps giving the speech-JARED
I am a woman. I am a powerful
woman. And I’m ready to take the
fist of my femininity to that
status quo.
(can barely do it)
Straight white man,
your...time...is...u-BAM! On the other side of the field the car bursts through a
gate and drives right onto the field. Everyone turns,
startled, as they swerve to drive right up to the stands.
JARED (CONT’D)
Oh, my God, my car is fucked up.
Amy and Molly stumble out, sprinting to the ceremony-MOLLY
(running, out of breath)
I’m here! We’re here!
The crowd cheers as they run down the aisle. Amy starts to
go to her seat but Molly tries to keep her up on stage-No, stay--

MOLLY (CONT’D)

AMY
I’ll go to my seat-MOLLY
(holding Amy’s arm up)
LOOK WHO MADE IT!
The crowd goes NUTS.
YES AMY!!

RYAN

MORE SENIORS
We want Amy!/AMY!/WE LOVE YOU AMY!

(CONTINUED)

99.
CONTINUED:
Amy blushes, amazed. Jared hands Molly the speech, eager to
get off the stage, but Molly stops him, leans in and kisses
him! In front of everyone!
The crowd LAUGHS and WHISTLES. Jared floats off, dazed. Molly
turns back to the crowd and grips the podium. Despite all of
her planning, she’s suddenly frozen with nerves.
MOLLY
Okay, uh...it seems like Jared did
a pretty good job.
She just stands there, taking in her classmates.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
You know, I was so...scared of you
guys, I felt like I had to prove I
was better than you. But really, I
don’t know any more than you. All
I know is that we all have a lot
more to learn.
Molly locks eyes with Amy. Amy smiles at her, emotional,
proud. All of a sudden Molly’s about to cry.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Because this part’s over. And
that’s so sad.
In the audience, Amy nods, tears in her eyes.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
But it was great, wasn’t it? Things
are never going to be the same, but
it was perfect.
(back to the audience)
And I may not have before, but I
see you. And you’re great. Don’t
let college fuck it up.
(then)
Congratulations, guys.
Amy gives a loud WOOP and the whole crowd CHEERS. Molly takes
Amy’s hand as George and Alan walk onstage.
GEORGE
Okay! That went over, but I will
not be cutting down my allotted
time.
(calling back)
Gigi, hit the track!

100.
INT. AMY’S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
Molly and a very emotional Charmaine help Amy pack.
CHARMAINE
I guess you’ll get an international
cellphone when you get there...oh,
good! You’re bringing Lingling!
Amy’s SEX PANDA is poking out of her suitcase. Before Amy can
stop her, Charmaine pulls out the bear. Amy and Molly watch
in horror as she starts SNUGGLING it to her face.
CHARMAINE (CONT’D)
You give Amy these kisses for me
when she gets lonely, okay
Lingling? All the way from America!
She gives the bear little kisses. The girls recoil-MOLLY
Make that stop-AMY
Okay give him back now! I wanna zip
up my suitcase!
Doug walks in and brightens when he sees-DOUG
Lingling! Lemme get in there-NO!

MOLLY

NO!

AMY

Molly slaps Lingling out of Charmaine’s hand before she can
hand it to Doug. An awkward beat.
DOUG
Uh, Amy, there’s someone here to
see you.
He gestures out through the window -- it’s Hope.
MOLLY
Why is she here?
(sees Amy blushing)
Amy! Why is she here?

101.
EXT. AMY’S HOUSE - DAY
Molly crouches to spy through the window as Amy walks
outside, morning-after shy.
Hey.
Hey.

AMY
HOPE

(then)
I just wanted to bring back your
clothes.
She hands Amy a plastic bag. Behind Hope, Molly freaks out
and starts SIGNING as Amy tries to ignore her.
AMY
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I don’t usually leave my underwear
places that...aren’t my room.
I figured.

HOPE

AMY
How was-- did you-- are you okay?
HOPE
Yeah, I’m fine. Are you okay?
AMY
Yeah. You know, prison kinda
changes you, but...
Hope laughs. Amy grins.
AMY (CONT’D)
I’m fine. I’m sorry. I just kinda
have no idea what I’m doing with
that stuff yet.
HOPE
Well, for someone who has no idea
what they’re doing...you kinda know
what you’re doing.
She raises her eyebrows and gives Amy a little smile. Amy
blushes so hard she laughs. She might die.
AMY
That’s-- um-- that’s cool. So what
are you, how is your summer going?
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

102.
CONTINUED:

AMY (CONT'D)
I mean, what are you doing this
summer?
HOPE
I think I’m gonna backpack around
for a bit.
AMY
Really? Where?
HOPE
I don’t really know. Anywhere I can
find a couch to crash. I just wanna
see some stuff before college.
AMY
That’s-- me too. Same. That’s why
I’m doing a gap year.

A nice moment. They weren’t expecting that.
HOPE
Well, have fun, nerd.
She hands Amy a slip of paper with her information on it. Amy
takes it, stunned. Hope starts to walk away, and Amy calls
after her-AMY
If you ever end up in Botswana,
you’d have a couch to crash on.
(can’t help herself)
Technically it won’t be my couch
because I’m staying with a family
but I’m sure they’ll be cool with
it!
Hope smile at her and keeps walking. Amy celebrates, then
sprints inside-Molly!

AMY (CONT’D)

EXT. LAX - DAY
Amy’s car inches around the bustling, chaotic airport.
MOLLY (O.S.)
Amy, this thing drives like a
cruise ship.

(CONTINUED)

103.
CONTINUED:
AMY (O.S.)
Well, she’s yours now. Take care
of the old Volvo for me.
INT. AMY’S CAR - DAY/EXT. LAX - DAY
Molly drives, Amy shotgun, back to riding like buddy cops.
MOLLY
Speaking of vulvas, remember when
you missed Hope’s and just went
straight for that BUTTHOLE!
AMY
Once a day. I said you could bring
it up once a day-MOLLY
I’m stocking up for your travel
days!
They both laugh. Molly pulls over and stops the car. Their
laughs die down.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
It’s so weird being on the driver’s
side. Everything feels off.
AMY
I can’t believe I’m not gonna see
you tomorrow.
MOLLY
Call me from your weird
international flip phone, okay?
AMY
I will. Okay bye. I love you.
MOLLY
Bye. I love you.
Bye.

AMY

Amy gets out and heaves out her bag.
MOLLY
Go make those tampons, girl.
AMY
I will! Bye.

(CONTINUED)

104.
CONTINUED:
Bye.

MOLLY

Amy just stands there in the window.
AMY
What’s a year, right?
They can’t look at each other. Amy closes the door and Molly
pulls back into the traffic. She turns back, but Amy’s not
looking. Molly tries to get a hold of herself as she inches
away, lost in thought. This is the next phase of her-BAM! Suddenly an out-of-breath Amy slams up against the
passenger window. Molly SCREAMS.
MOLLY
Oh my GOD! What the fuck is wrong
with you?! I was going through a
thing! I was going through a whole
emotional goodbye thing!
Amy dives back into the passenger seat, out of breath.
AMY
I can be the last one on the plane.
(grins)
Wanna get pancakes?
Molly beams.
MOLLY
Fuck yeah I do.
SLAM TO BLACK!
