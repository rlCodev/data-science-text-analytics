INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DAY

.

1

CLOSE on a CANDLE, its base ringed by dripped wax. It’s
perched on the sill of a small window, bathed in grayish,
early morning light.
A SNUFFER enters the frame and extinguishes the flame.
We PULL BACK to see the MAIDSERVANT who has just put out the
candle, moving onto the next candle in the long corridor,
snuffing it out as well. And onto the next when she HEARS...
The ECHO of footfalls and clanking swords. As THREE MEN round
the corner she steps back, head bowed, making room for them.
Walking briskly toward us are THOMAS ANDREWS (Sheriff of
Northamptonshire) flanked by two Earls - SHREWSBURY and KENT.
They pass by the Maidservant without acknowledging her. She
watches them go as they round another corner.
Andrews and his men arrive at a small door. A GUARD awaits
them. Upon their arrival the Guard fetches a set of keys from
his belt...
EXT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - DAY
Establishing - a foreboding, turreted castle rising from the
marshland of an adjacent river, surrounded by a moat. We hear
the UNLOCKING OF A BOLT as we CUT TO-INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - PRIVY CHAMBER - DAY
MARY STUART - Queen of Scots, Dowager Queen of France.
But we see her from BEHIND - her back to us. And this is
where we shall stay for now. Seeing events as she does,
following from just a few feet to the rear.
She is on her knees in prayer, joined by her CHAMBERMAIDS and
an OLDER MARY SETON (the younger version of whom we shall
introduce soon), facing a small window which overlooks the
landscape we just saw. As the heavy door pivots open,
revealing Andrews, she remains in prayer, her back to him.
He bows his head, then, with solemnity and respect-ANDREWS
It’s time.
Mary stands, as do her Servants. She’s wearing a long, black
satin gown. A white cap and laced veil against which her
dark, auburn hair is lustrous. It’s her hair that we’re drawn
to - since we’ve yet to see her face.

2.

She goes to a side table and retrieves two carefully chosen
items, an ivory crucifix in one hand, a Latin prayer book in
the other.
Meanwhile one of the Maidservants loops a string of rosary
beads with a golden cross to a girdle at her waist. Another
fastens a gold chain around her neck, from which hangs a
medallion bearing the image of Christ as the Lamb of God.
EXT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
From behind. Mary is being led across by the Earls and
Guards. She pauses to look up at the sky. The last time she
will feel the sun directly on her face.
ANDREWS (O.S.)
Your grace.
She resumes following her escort, who have paused for her.
EXT. HAMPTON COURT - COURTYARD - DAY
QUEEN ELIZABETH - from behind - walking alone, slowly, as if
in a daze. She looks up at the sky, then lowers her head. She
begins to sob. We can’t see her tears, but we can see her
body shaking.
CECIL (O.S.)
Your grace.
We shift focus to WILLIAM CECIL on the far side of the
courtyard. He is her most trusted advisor on the Privy
Council - a persuasive, manipulative man who understands the
realpolitik of power and wields it well. From behind him, we
see Elizabeth quickly dry her tears.
INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - LARGE CORRIDOR - DAY
We’re above and behind as Mary strides through a large set of
doors, her Ladies, Andrews and Guards in tow.
Down the hall a little SERVANT GIRL peeks around the corner
to get a glimpse. The MAIDSERVANT from the first scene grabs
her by the wrist and pulls her out of view.
Mary rounds the corner, taking us to-INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY
A vast room filled with a hundred SPECTATORS. At the far end
of the room is a WOODEN STAGE.
The crowd parts. She heads directly for the stage, mounts the
steps to the platform where two MEN stand waiting for her.

3.

Still behind her, from over her shoulder, we can see the
crowd staring up, a hundred solemn faces - the KNIGHTS and
GENTLEMEN OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. There is a low murmuring as a
number of men speak in hushed tones to each other.
It’s worth noting that this crowd is ALL MEN. The only women
in attendance are Old Seton and Mary’s two Ladies.
Mary’s back and the POV beyond fills the frame, but offscreen we hear three KNOCKS of a cane on the wooden platform
to call the room to attention. A slight, barely noticeable
flinch from each knock as the room silences.
The Clerk of Elizabeth’s Privy Council, ROBERT BEALE - reads
aloud off-screen. We only hear his voice-BEALE (O.S.)
By order of our sovereign
Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales
and Ireland, Overlord of Scotland,
certified by her Privy Council and
Parliament, Mary Stuart is
condemned to death this day, the
eighth of February, the year of our
Lord one thousand five hundred
eighty-seven...
During which we CUT from face to face of Nobles in the
audience, all staring up at Mary in morbid fascination and
anxiousness. We are in Mary’s POV now.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
On Elizabeth’s back as a Guard opens the chamber door. The
COUNCIL stands and bows as she takes her seat. With a slight
gesture she instructs them to sit. Cecil steps forward.
CECIL
For your fellow Princes on the
continent - that they might know...
He places a letter before her. She glances over it. An
ATTENDANT brings her a quill and ink. She looks back up.
ELIZABETH
We will not ask God’s forgiveness
for that which is just.
INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY
We are still behind Mary. She stands. Two Earls remove her
outer garment - the black satin - revealing a crimson garment
beneath. The colour of martyrdom. A collective gasp.
We CUT TO Noblemen in the midst of the crowd, gazing at her
with disgust. One whispers to the other--

4.

MILDMAY
She thinks herself a martyr.
KNIGHTLEY
Wretched woman.
BACK TO Mary. She turns to the Executioner - BULL. We remain
on her back. Bull bows his head in supplication-BULL
I plead your forgiveness.
MARY
I forgive you with all my heart.
You shall make an end of all my
troubles.
Bull gestures to a cushion before her in front of the block.
As Mary kneels down she begins to recite a psalm in Latin-MARY (CONT’D)
Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ,
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra,
salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ,
In te Domino confido...
As she repeats the prayer the camera COMES AROUND to face
Mary for the FIRST TIME.
As we do, we hear a SURGE of surf on a shore, and once we
land upon her face, we are no longer in Fotheringhay
Castle...
It is 27 YEARS PRIOR and we are at-EXT. SCOTTISH COAST - DAY
Mary kneeling on the sand in prayer. The water is surging up,
soaking her dress. She shivers from the cold but continues
her prayer.
The moment has the same solemnity as the execution sequence,
but the daylight and anticipation and Mary’s youth also
charge it with the excitement and danger of a new beginning.
As the surf retreats she leans down and kisses the sand - the
first time she’s touched Scottish soil since she was a girl.
Behind her we can see her ship anchored in the distance.
Several rowboats have been pulled up onto the shore - trunks
and other goods being unloaded by sailors.
A distressed look on Mary’s ashen face while she’s still bent
down, her face inches above the sand. She retches. Four women
quickly come to her aid.

5.

They are the “Four Marys” - BEATON, SETON, FLEMING and
LIVINGSTON - Mary’s ladies-in-waiting and closest friends. We
hear concerned chatter among them as they attend to their
mistress.
MARY
C’est fini.
(It’s passed.)
--which silences them. Mary cups her hand in the salt water
and brings it up to her mouth to wash her face clean. Seton
hands her a handkerchief. Mary dries her face then stands.
Horses are making their way onto the shore. On BOTHWELL - A
Scottish Lord and the Queen’s Champion. He has the hardened
bearing of a soldier accented by the flash of an adventurer.
He looks down the shore and sees figures in the distance PEASANTS cockle-picking. Near them is a small wagon with a
Clydesdale pony.
EXT. SCOTTISH COAST - DAY
We’re further down the shore with the PEASANT FAMILY now:
They include an OLDER MAN, TWO TEENAGE SONS and a LITTLE GIRL
- his daughter.
Bothwell is paying the OLDER MAN several coins as GUARDS are
emptying the wagon of cockles, dumping them on a pile in the
sand. Mary is nearby on foot beside her horse.
Mary looks at the old Peasant. A hard, poor life is evidenced
by the deep wrinkles in his face, a mouth turned inward by
lost teeth.
Then she looks to his DAUGHTER - in a dirty muddy burlap
frock - who does not bow. She’s only five years old, the same
age Mary was when she fled to France.
CUT TO the Nobleman helping the Four Marys into the peasant
wagon. Livingston holds a handkerchief to her nose, put off
by the fishy smell. The other three seem no less disgusted.
BACK TO Mary as Bothwell helps her onto her horse. Legs
astride, not side saddle. Once atop, she looks regal.
Bothwell mounts his horse and leads the small entourage
forward.
The little girl runs to keep up with it. Her father yells out
to her but she ignores him, running alongside Mary’s horse.
Mary and the little girl lock eyes. She sees a curious and
defiant fire in the girl’s expression which aligns with her
own curious and defiant flame.
Mary smiles at the girl. She smiles back, then stops. Mary
turns her eyes forward again, as if staring into her future.

6.

Bothwell turns to her, in French-BOTHWELL
Tout cela correspond à vos
souvenirs?
(Is it how you remember it?)
MARY
Je m’en souviens à peine.
(I scarcely remember it at all.)

INT. HAMPTON COURT - LONG GALLERY - DAY
In stark contrast to the rawness of the Scottish countryside,
we’re in an opulent, formal chamber. RANDOLPH - the English
Ambassador to Scotland - stands before Elizabeth. Cecil is
off to her side. Dudley is to the other side, along with two
other LORDS. Elizabeth’s ladies sit on stools and pillows
near her feet.
RANDOLPH
Her protector is Lord Bothwell, an
able soldier.
CECIL
So she comes readied for war.
RANDOLPH
She may well depart once married.
But I cannot profess to know her
purpose.
ELIZABETH
What says her brother?
RANDOLPH
Moray is only her half-brother,
Madam. I believe his allegiance is
fully with us.
ELIZABETH
What proof?
RANDOLPH
He pledges to protect the Church of
Scotland.
CECIL
And yet he has no power to make
such a pledge if he is no longer
Regent.

7.

RANDOLPH
The Nobles respect him.
CECIL
But can he control her?
DUDLEY
(directed at Cecil)
If she is like our Queen, she does
not yield to a bridle.
Giggles from the Ladies. Even Elizabeth is amused.
CECIL
So says our Master of the Horse.
More giggles from the ladies. Cecil doubles down-CECIL (CONT’D)
(to Dudley)
By bridle do you speak of
mounts...?
Dudley stiffens. This is a touchy subject to bring up in a
public setting, but Cecil will not allow himself to be
challenged by an inferior Lord. Then triples down-CECIL (CONT’D)
...or do you speak of matrimony?
Elizabeth holds up her hand to silence everyone. Cecil has
gone far enough. He gives her a slight nod. She waits a beat
for solemnity to return, then-ELIZABETH
(to Randolph)
You may tell Scotland that we wish
to love the Stuarts as our kin, but
they should love us in return.
CECIL
Madam - if I may speak...
All eyes on Cecil.
CECIL (CONT’D)
While she is on this island, she
must bow to you, not to Rome. Our
Catholics must know that a papist
will never again sit on the English
throne.
ELIZABETH
She has offered to recognise my
rightful claim.

8.

CECIL
Only if you make her heir. We owe
her no such consolation.
ELIZABETH
What would you suggest?
CECIL
(to Randolph)
Is it fair to say that Moray would
rather remain Regent?
RANDOLPH
His discomfort would imply so.
CECIL
(back to Elizabeth)
Let his discomfort feed hers. Kill
her hope. And hopeless she may
return to the comfort of the
continent.
Cecil switches tones.
CECIL (CONT’D)
Of course, if you should offer
love, perhaps your love will sway
her. But I do not know what mortal
would choose a Prince’s love over a
Prince’s crown.
It’s enough to convince her. She turns to Randolph-ELIZABETH
Speak to her brother. Make our
demands clear.
RANDOLPH
Recognition without recompense.
ELIZABETH
However you choose to convey it.
RANDOLPH
Aye, Madam - I shall go at once.
During which Cecil shoots Dudley a look. This is how you
bridle a Queen.
EXT. HOLYROOD - EVENING
CLOSE on the EARL OF MORAY, Regent of Scotland and Mary’s
half-brother. He is atop a small bridge with windows on
either side as he watches Mary’s entourage approach beneath.
The castle itself looms above them all.

9.

We can see a flurry of activity in the courtyard beyond him SERVANTS darting through the courtyard in preparation for the
Queen’s arrival, hurriedly lighting torches. On his face we
see tenseness. He’d rather none of this were happening.
Moray leaves the window to go and greet his sister.
TIME CUT to the Courtyard. TIGHT on Mary’s outstretched hand.
Then Moray’s face enters the frame and lightly kisses it.
We PULL BACK to see Moray kneeling before her, removing his
sword as he does so.
MARY
Mon frère...
(My brother)
He stands and she embraces him. Bothwell watches from several
yards away. He and Moray lock eyes - mutual distrust - as
Moray and Mary embrace.
INT. HOLYROOD - HALLS - EVENING
Mary, Moray and the Four Marys make their way through
corridors and a series of chambers, some half-furnished and
being decorated for the Queen, others still bare. Everything
feels a bit ad hoc and rushed. The servants bow as Mary
passes. She soaks it in during the following exchange with
Moray - only vaguely familiar. On the whole she might as well
be laying eyes upon these rooms for the first time.
MORAY
You must be tired.
MARY
I am quite well.
MORAY
Supper is being prepared. We can
have it brought to your chamber if
you like.
MARY
Yes, thank you.
A beat. Moray considers his next question, then asks it
casually, though it’s far from a casual question-MORAY
How long will you be staying?
MARY
At Holyrood?
MORAY
In Scotland.

10.

She answers him just as casually, though like the question
itself, there’s nothing casual about it’s substance.
MARY
(with a smile)
Are you already planning my
departure?
MORAY
Of course not. We’ve long awaited
your return.
Moray turns to a servant - KATE, elderly - who has been
trailing behind them.
MORAY (CONT’D)
Kate will show you to your
chambers.
KATE
This way, Madam.
As Kate leads Mary and her Ladies down an adjacent hall,
Moray’s smile fades. He turns to Bothwell.
MORAY
Do you intend to stay as well?
BOTHWELL
I swore an oath to the Queen’s
mother to protect her.
MORAY
She is well protected here.
BOTHWELL
I shall uphold my oath just the
same.
MORAY
And what reward does your loyalty
command?
BOTHWELL
I am driven by duty, not ambition.
A scoffing and dismissive half-smirk from Moray. He doesn’t
buy it for a moment.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
The room is lit by several candles, but still dim. It’s
completely empty. Mary looks around, taking in the bareness.
KATE
We are having a bed brought from
town.

10A.

Mary points to a wall, addressing the Servant-MARY
My mother’s was here?
KATE
Yes, Madam.

11.

And with this the Servant’s voice breaks. She can’t stop a
tear from rolling down her cheek.
KATE (CONT’D)
My apologies...
Mary goes to her-MARY
What is it?
KATE
Her Majesty was too young to
recall...
(puts a palm to her chest)
...but I was your wet nurse. You’re
so beautiful. Like your mother.
Mary offers her a warm, compassionate smile.
KATE (CONT’D)
(embarrassed, to escape--)
With permission - I will make
certain the bed.
Mary nods. Kate exits the chamber. Mary turns to the Four
Marys, who are trying to hide their mortification at the
gloomy environs.
MARY
A dire vrai, ce n’est pas une autre
France.
(It is no France.)
She offers this as humour, and the Four Marys force a laugh,
but it’s not very convincing. Then quite seriously-MARY (CONT’D)
Mais notre devoir n’est plus à la
France. C’est ici qu’il nous amène.
(But our duty is no longer to
France. It is here.)
The Four Marys stop smiling. It’s a solemn reminder that
their lives are forever changed.
INT. HOLYROOD - RECEIVING ROOM - DAY
Mary is seated while an ARTIST paints a miniature portrait of
her. The Four Marys are overseeing ATTENDANTS who are in the
process of hanging tapestries on the walls. Mary is beginning
to make the place her own. Moray is with her.
MORAY
Emperor Ferdinand looks to wed one
of his sons...

12.

MARY
Are we to bow to the Hapsburgs?
MORAY
They are a good family. Quite
powerful.
MARY
And would require me to leave
Scotland.
MORAY
A small price for such a favorable
union.
She turns to him-MARY
Favorable for whom?
They lock eyes for a moment. On Moray, clenching his jaw.
Mary notices something on the far side of the room beyond
Moray. Stands-MARY (CONT’D)
Higher.
And we see she’s referring to one of the tapestries being
hung on the wall. The Attendants raise it a foot.
MARY (CONT’D)
This one.
Mary watches as the ATTENDANTS climb down from their ladders
and move the tapestry over to the new wall. As they place the
ladders, they raise the tapestry-MARY (CONT’D)
Yes. Thank you.
(to Moray)
Better - is it not?
MORAY
(stifling his annoyance)
I know nothing of these matters.
She takes his hand. Warmly-MARY
You have done us a great service as
ward over this realm. We would be
wise to follow your example. Let us
dispense with marriage for now and
talk of governance. Those are
matters which you know far better
than myself.
He forces a smile.

13.

MORAY
I appreciate your confidence in me.
She glances back up at the tapestry, decisive.
MARY
Yes. Hang it here.
She heads back over to sit before the Artist.
MARY (CONT’D)
Continue.
ARTIST
Chin higher.
We are TIGHT on the Artist’s POV as she tilts her chin up.
We CUT FROM this visage of her face to-INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEENS CHAMBER - DAY
Her portrait. A small one. Held in the light by BESS OF
HARDWICK, Elizabeth’s lady in waiting.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)
What do you see Bess?
We PULL BACK. Elizabeth is studying the miniature along with
Bess as the other ladies in waiting make final adjustments to
Elizabeth’s appearance - placing rings on fingers, powdering
her face-BESS
Charming. Fair - if the painter
does not lie. Arrogant, perhaps. I
do not like the look of her.
(beat)
And you?
ELIZABETH
Young. Clever.
(beat)
Confident.
Looks down at her hand as a Lady places a ring upon it.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
She would have no trouble securing
a husband, even without her throne.
BESS
Nor would you, Madam.
Elizabeth turns to her, eyes flashing--

14.

BESS (CONT’D)
Forgive me...
INT. HAMPTON COURT - LONG GALLERY - DAY
COURTIERS are crammed into the room, waiting for Elizabeth to
emerge. This is one of the few times of the day that they
have direct access to the Queen. It’s all about jockeying for
position, being seen and seeing others.
Among those in court are the EARL OF LENNOX and his handsome
17 year-old son, HENRY DARNLEY, straining to get a prime spot
near the door to the Queen’s chambers.
As Lennox tries to edge his way forward-LENNOX
(to Darnley)
Come. Closer.
We SHIFT TO right by the door to the Queen’s chambers where
we find Cecil and Dudley. They have a prime position because
they will escort her to the privy council chamber. They speak
in low tones so as not to be overheard.
DUDLEY
She will not accept my hand.
CECIL
You cannot be certain.
DUDLEY
I know because I know her heart.
The moment I betray it with
ambition, I lose her heart.
CECIL
Would you rather she lose her
crown?
DUDLEY
You exaggerate.
CECIL
(growing impatient)
How much blood has been spilled in
Rome’s name? If a Catholic Queen
bears a child before our own, have
no doubt that blood will spill
again. Muster your courage and save
us from her reticence.
DUDLEY
What you claim I lack in courage,
you lack in reason, sir. She will
not have me.

14A.

CECIL
Nor would I have a commoner be king
of England if we were not desperate
for an heir. But we must mould the
clay before us.
DUDLEY
(insulted)
I am no commoner.
CECIL
Nor are you noble.

15.

INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEENS CHAMBER - DAY
Bess adjusts Elizabeth’s hair. Elizabeth holds out her hand
and an attendant places a hand mirror in it. Elizabeth holds
up the mirror and looks at her own reflection.
We RACK FOCUS from the mirror to the portrait of Mary in the
background so that her blurred reflection and the portrait
are side by side in the frame. Elizabeth lets her gaze linger
on the portrait for a moment, we RACK FOCUS back to the
mirror as she looks at her face once again, then turns and
presents herself to her ladies. With a matter-of-fact,
discerning eye.
BESS
Aye.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - LONG GALLERY - DAY
We are with Cecil and Dudley again-DUDLEY
You should bring it up with her
directly.
CECIL
I have, many times.
DUDLEY
Then there is your answer.
CECIL
On all other matters she follows my
counsel. I have her trust, but you
have her affections. However much
it pains me, I am not above
admitting you wield a power I do
not. You can succeed where I-But before he can finish the sentence, the doors to the
Queen’s Chamber open, revealing Elizabeth.
The COURTIERS bow as they part to form a diagonal path across
the room. Elizabeth turns to Cecil and Dudley.
ELIZABETH
(to Cecil)
Good morning, William.
CECIL
Madam.
She turns to Dudley, and saying it with far more warmth-ELIZABETH
Robert.

15A.

DUDLEY
(as warmly)
Resplendent.

16.

Elizabeth smiles.
ELIZABETH
Would you?
He holds out his arm. She loops hers within his. They begin
to walk along the path, Cecil falling in closely behind them
with Bess and the Ladies.
A bit of jostling among the Courtiers to be closest to the
path. It’s not unseemly - they are Nobles and need to
maintain their dignity - but it’s noticeable.
As Elizabeth walks, she nods to some, ignores others. Lennox
presses forward, Darnley following. As Elizabeth approaches,
Lennox makes a show of a deep bow, but it goes intentionally
unnoticed by Elizabeth.
Lennox tries to recover by appealing to Cecil once Elizabeth
has passed, stepping out in front of him. He keeps his volume
low so as not to be overheard-LENNOX
My Lord - I would ask our mistress
to beseech Queen Mary that I be
allowed to return to Scotland as
Earl of our ancestral-CECIL
(the gall, full volume)
This is not the place.
LENNOX
(insistent)
It would be wise to have a Catholic
servant there. My influence would-CECIL
It is your influence which
emboldened papists here.
This is said loud enough for the entire room to turn its
attention to Cecil and Lennox, which is what Cecil wants.
Even Elizabeth turns and looks back. Lennox is red with
embarrassment. Cecil and Dudley continue on. Lennox looks
around and sees all eyes staring at him.
Elizabeth exits the room and the crowd begins to dissolve. In
low tones to his father-DARNLEY
You humiliate yourself.
Without hesitation Lennox turns and slaps his son hard across
the face. Darnley reels, stunned. Lennox heads for the exit.
Now it is Darnley whom the remaining Courtiers are staring
at.

17.

INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
TIGHT on a young Italian Man - RIZZIO - playing the
Renaissance Violin with accompaniment. He is comely, and a
talented musician.
The chamber is still in the process of being decorated - far
more modest in its architecture and furnishings than what we
saw in Hampton Court, but still brighter and more luxurious
than when we first saw the castle.
The Four Marys are staring at Rizzio with admiration, even
perhaps a bit of lust. He smiles at Livingston, who looks at
her feet while blushing. The other Marys giggle, drawing
attention from some of the NOBLES who are waiting in a line
to kiss Mary’s hand.
Among those passing by is MAITLAND - a high-ranking Noble,
diplomatic and innocuous on the surface, but a snake within.
He and Fleming lock eyes - an instant attraction.
Moray introduces the guests to Mary as they come before her-MORAY
William Maitland of Lethington,
Secretary of State.
Maitland turns his attention back to Mary. Kneels down and
kisses her hand.
Next up is KNOX - a Protestant Cleric, severely dressed with
an even more severe manner.
MORAY (CONT’D)
John Knox, Church of Scotland.
As Knox bends down to kiss Mary’s hand, Rizzio screeches his
bow across the strings of his renaissance violin - a comic
sound. Knox turns back to Rizzio with disgust. The Four Marys
giggle, and Mary herself cannot help but smile.
RIZZIO
A loose string.
Although this thin excuse does nothing to placate Knox. Moray
veers things back to business-MORAY
Let us begin.
The Lords sit down on chairs in a semi-circle around the
throne. Once they are settled, Mary addresses them in French.
MARY
Il est certain que beaucoup d’entre
vous ne vous alliez qu’à regret à
une Reine Française et Catholique.
(MORE)

18.

MARY (CONT'D)
(We are certain many of you are ill
at ease aligning yourself with a
French and Catholic Queen...)
Some of the other Lords look askance at each other in
reaction to her speaking a non-native language.
MARY (CONT’D)
(she abruptly switches to
Scots)
But your Queen is in Scotland now.
She pauses, letting her use of Scots sink in. Then-MARY (CONT’D)
When my beloved François passed to
God, I could have married any
number of suitors. Portugal.
Denmark. Sweden. Many others. The
Hapsburgs offered their sons.
(beat)
I declined them all.
On Moray. He’d much prefer she be married off.
MARY (CONT’D)
Just as I would not have an
uncertain fate imposed upon myself,
I will not impose an uncertain fate
upon my subjects.
(beat)
They remain free to worship however
they so choose, Catholic or
Protestant.
A look of surprise from the assembled Lords. This is not what
they were expecting.

INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Elizabeth is at the head of the table. Cecil speaks on behalf
of his fellow Counsellors, which include Dudley and Randolph.
CECIL
Her pronouncements mean nothing.
Whom she marries speaks louder than
any edict from the throne.
ELIZABETH
(to Randolph)
What say’st our Ambassador?

19.

RANDOLPH
She feigns disinterest, Madam...

Green Revisions (18.10.17)

20.

INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Randolph - in stiff formality - concludes his report.
RANDOLPH
She is formidable, Madam.
On Elizabeth - she grimaces at this assessment of her rival.
INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Mary before her Lords, as before.

21.

MARY
Pastor, you look displeased with
our tolerance?
A general nervousness flutters among the Lords, not least of
all with Moray, but Knox is not the least bit intimidated.
KNOX
Any realm that is ruled by the Pope
is not tolerant, Madam. It is
enslaved-MARY
Stand when I address you.
Knox makes a show of standing slowly, resolutely and saying
the following words with equally slow resolve.
KNOX
There is one true God. And
therefore one true religion.
MARY
Such rhetoric incites revolt.
KNOX
If a Prince strays from God’s will,
it is not in doubt that they may be
resisted. And in your case, as with
all women: their sight is but
blindness; their strength,
weakness; their counsel,
foolishness; their judgment,
frenzy. Are we to abide a papist
and a woman both?
Mary is stunned, but gathers herself to have the last, if
shaky, word-MARY
Well then, I perceive that my
subjects shall obey you, and not
me. And shall do what they like,
and not what I command. And so must
I be subject to them, and not they
to me.
Unwavering, and unmoved-KNOX
May I sit, Madam?
MARY
No. You may remove yourself from
this council and my court.
A gasp of unease from the other Lords. Knox, with all the
pride he can muster--

22.

KNOX
My council is among the faithful
disciples I serve. We have as
little need of this court as it has
of us. I pray for your soul, Madam.
Knox slowly makes for the door, milking his exit.
INT. HOLYROOD - HALLWAY - DAY
Mary walks briskly with Moray. She can no longer contain her
rage - face flushed, speaking as briskly as she walks-MORAY
I beg you to reconsider. He has the
trust of the people.
MARY
Did I not give deference to his
faith?
MORAY
Yes. But we must be delicate.
Allegiance does not happen by
proclama-She stops and turns to him, her rage frothing-MARY
And where is his delicacy? That he
should speak to a monarch so? Would
he challenge Elizabeth thus?
MORAY
With what cause? He would welcome a
Protestant Queen. Which is
precisely why we must not push him
into her arms. Show him love.
MARY
You are wise, brother. There are
times for wisdom. And there are
times for love. But there are also
times for strength.
She continues on. Off Moray, swallowing his frustration.
INT. SCOTTISH CHURCH - DAY
A sparse, undecorated place of worship, clearly Protestant.
Knox stands at a pulpit, delivering a sermon. The front rows
are filled with nobility, including Maitland, who is sitting
in the first row, listening with great interest.

23.

As the rows progress toward the back they are populated with
MERCHANTS and PEASANTS. It’s a packed room, and some of the
peasants are forced to stand in the rear by the open door to
the street. This is part religious fervor, part retribution
at having been removed from court-KNOX
(with force)
We have a scourge upon our land.
‘Tis worse than pestilence or
famine. ‘Tis worse than the Roman
pagans or Egyptian pharaohs. ‘Tis a
woman with a crown who only
pretends to worship Christ when in
truth she kneels before the Pope.
We will not bow as she does.
Murmurs of approval from the congregation. Knox’s charismatic
forcefulness picks up steam-KNOX (CONT’D)
We do not pray to false idols. We
do not take instruction from Rome.
We resist those who would tempt us
with indulgences. Deny those who
worship luxury. Respect not those
who flaunt their excesses...
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
The Four Marys are helping Mary undress. The room is now wellappointed with furniture and tapestries.
KNOX (V.O.)
...who whore themselves to wealth
and the degradations of the flesh.
Mary taps Fleming’s cheek with her finger.
MARY
Alors, ici?
(What about here?)
The girls are laughing. Fleming blushing.
MARY (CONT’D)
(taps Flemings’ nose)
Ici?
(Here?)
FLEMING
(through her laughter)
Non.
(No.)
Mary puts a finger to Fleming’s lips.

24.

MARY
Il vous a embrassé ici?
(Has he kissed you here?)
FLEMING
(sheepishly)
Une fois...
(Once...)
The others gasp, titillated.
FLEMING (CONT’D)
...Sans aller plus loin.
(...But no further.)
MARY
(turning to Beaton)
Et vous alors? Ils embrassent
comment, les Anglais?
(What about you? How well do the
English kiss?)
BEATON
(smiling, embarrassed)
Madame...
Mary turns on a dime, suddenly serious.
MARY
What matters have you discussed
with the Ambassador between your
kisses?
A chill between them all. The undressing has halted.
BEATON
Même s’il y a de l’amitié entre lui
et moi-(We are friendly, but I--)
MARY
(to Fleming)
Or you - with my Secretary of
State.
FLEMING
Madame - vous savez que nous-(Madam - you know we--)
MARY
In Scots.
FLEMING
Our loyalty is to you alone.
Mary warms, thawing the chill--

25.

MARY
I jest. I know you love me.
But was she jesting? They resume undressing her.
MARY (CONT’D)
Just be wary of these men. Their
love is not the same as their
respect.
The Mary’s remove layer upon layer, down to her smock. After
several beats-FLEMING
Might I ask - since we have not
known it ourselves...
(gathers the courage)
What is it like...?
Less ashamed to complete the question than Fleming to ask-MARY
To have a man?
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Atop the bed with drapes drawn for privacy. Elizabeth with
Dudley. Her sleeves have been removed. The farthingale
beneath her dress bulges up as they sit side by side.
Dudley gently pushes the smock sleeve up Elizabeth’s forearm,
revealing the skin of her wrist. He brings it to his mouth
and kisses the underside. Elizabeth closes her eyes, shaking
from the touch. Lips on skin is forbidden and thrilling.
MARY (V.O.)
I have only lain with François...
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary with the Marys. They’re still undressing her-MARY
He shook terribly from fright. As
did I. The poor boy did his best...
INTERCUT WITH SCENE 35-INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
MUSIC rises from a DANCE. Two hands, palms flat to each other
- a man and woman’s...
MARY (V.O.)
...but it was over before it began.

26.

BACK TO Mary in her bedchamber with the Marys-FLEMING
So you never...
MARY
No. We tried but once.
BACK TO the Banquet Hall - TIGHT on Mary’s glowing face,
flushed from the thrill of a man’s touch-MARY (V.O.)
Yet I found myself...stirred, a
wanting like none other...
We PULL BACK to see that she’s dancing with Bothwell-MARY (V.O.)
Not so much for him...
Then gliding to another Nobleman, then another, her face
warmed by the music and hundreds of candles that fill the
room. As she whisks between the men-MARY (V.O.)
...but for the thing itself...the
touch...skin upon skin.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
The MUSIC from the DANCE continues as-Dudley is kissing Elizabeth’s nape, beginning to unloosen her
corset, but Elizabeth pulls away.
Dudley reluctantly lets go of the strings. Takes Elizabeth’s
hand and brings it between his legs.
DUDLEY
Do you feel my passion?
ELIZABETH
Quiet Robert.
The music slows to something more elegaic and sparse as she
withdraws Dudley’s hand. Disappointment on his face. Silence.
We POP to Bess and the Ladies in Waiting outside the drapes,
tilting towards the drapes to see if they can overhear the
whispers within.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
The Marys are rapt, gathered around Mary as she sits on the
foot stool of her bed, now down to her smock.

27.

MARY
I should like to marry again. To
know what it means to have a man
fully. But...
And we see her shift from revery to cold prudence-MARY (CONT’D)
...not if I am owned.
The music STOPS. A beat. Mary stands.
MARY (CONT’D)
Shall we sleep?
SETON
You’re early...
Following Seton’s gaze, Mary looks down. Sees a splotch of
blood seeped through at her groin.
BEATON
I’ll get a fresh cloth.
As Beaton gets up we TIME CUT TO-Mary surrounded by the Marys. Beaton with a swaddle in hand.
Seton with a basin and damp cloth.
LIVINGSTON
Levez les bras.
(Lift your arms.)
Mary lifts her arms, the three remaining Marys avert their
eyes as they begin to raise her smock above Mary’s head, for
no mortal is allowed to see a sovereign nude.
CUT TO TIGHT on Mary’s bare legs beneath the groin. We see a
trickle of blood running down the length of her thigh to the
knee. Seton washes the blood away with the damp cloth.
CUT TO TIGHT on the basin as Seton wrings the cloth, blood
clouding the water within.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
TIGHT on two hands barely touching on white linen - their
pinky fingers grazing one another-DUDLEY (O.S.)
Do not ask this of me.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)
If you wed her she is ours.
We PULL BACK to see Elizabeth and Dudley laying side by side,
still fully clothed. They talk low so as not to be heard.

28.

DUDLEY
And what of us?
ELIZABETH
What us?
DUDLEY
You, Elizabeth. And I, your Robert.
ELIZABETH
One of those is a Prince. The other
is...
She does not finish. He waits, then-DUDLEY
Is what?
ELIZABETH
Is merely my Robert.
DUDLEY
(with a hint of
bitterness)
Merely.
ELIZABETH
With Mary you too become a Prince.
DUDLEY
If I am Noble enough to marry one
Queen, I am noble enough for
another.
Dudley moves in - Elizabeth withdraws.
DUDLEY (CONT’D)
Elizabeth... I know it cannot be.
(repeating himself)
I know it cannot be.
ELIZABETH
England is not Scotland.
INT. HOLYROOD - ANTE ROOM - DAY
Rizzio is escorted into the room by an Attendant, a DOG
circling at him, barking loudly. He holds his lute high as
the dog leaps up, nipping at it.
It’s late Autumn. Rain pelts the windows. They approach Mary
and her four ladies seated on the ground before the fire - an
indoor picnic with a sumptuous lunch.
MARY
Worry not. She’s harmless...

28A.

Mary whistles. The DOG runs over to her. Mary feeds her a
piece of meat from her plate. She pets the dog affectionately
as she devours the meat.

29.

RIZZIO
You requested music, your Majesty?
MARY
What accent is that?
RIZZIO
Italian.
MARY
How is your command of French?
With spirit, he launches into a popular Arbeau chanson-RIZZIO
Belle qui tiens ma vie
Captive dans tes yeux,
Qui m'as l’âme ravie
D'un sourire gracieux...
Mary and the others clap with approval. Rizzio bows.
MARY
Is your hand as good as your
French?
RIZZIO
(puzzled)
My hand, Madam?
MARY
I must make love to a woman, and I
would have a man’s hand to help me.
One who is loyal like my friend
here.
--she says as she runs her hand through the dog’s fur.
TIME CUT to TIGHT ON Rizzio’s hand writing with a quill on
parchment. We see the words in French that we hear-MARY (CONT’D)
Madame, ma bonne cousine...
(Madam, my good cousin...)
We switch to English for the sake of clarity. And see Rizzio
seated at a small table writing, Mary plucking grapes from a
bundle while she reclines on a rug, dictating the letter-MARY (CONT’D)
We are two sisters bound by
womanhood, two Princes on the same
island, and ruling side by side
must do with affection...
RIZZIO
“In harmony” perhaps.

29A.

MARY
Yes. I like that.

30.

EXT. HOLYROOD - COLONNADE - DUSK
Mary walks along the colonnade as we see flakes of snow
floating down into the court. The Four Marys & Rizzio are
with Mary’s dogs, that are playing in the snow in the middle
of the courtyard.
MARY (V.O.)
...ruling side by side we must do
so in harmony. Not through a treaty
drafted by men lesser than
ourselves, but respecting each
other’s rightful claims granted by
God...
She places her palm out and lets a flake fall on it-MARY (V.O.)
As the first snow falls to the
North...

EXT. HAMPTON COURT - DAY
TIGHT on the HOOVES of a HORSE walking through a fresh
blanket of snow as it continues to fall, leaving hoofprints-MARY (V.O.)
...it is the same snow that will
fall at your feet.
CUT TO from ABOVE as the riderless horse is being led to the
entrance by a GROOM, snow covering the ground.
MARY (V.O.)
From the same heaven above, in
service of the same Lord...
INT. HAMPTON COURT - DAY
TIGHT on the flat blade of a knife scraping along a length of
coloured paper, the paper curling as it does-MARY (V.O.)
...And when the same spring flowers
for us both...
PULL back to see Elizabeth placing the curled paper into an
intricate quilling design of flowers on a painted board.

30A.

MARY (V.O.)
I hope we might meet in person,
that I might embrace you...

31.

We TRACK UP to on Elizabeth’s face, warmed by the fire.
MARY (V.O.)
...and we might resolve our
destinies...
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN'S CHAMBER - DAY
Elizabeth is pacing, dictating a letter to a nearby SCRIBE-ELIZABETH
We would delight in holding our
sister’s hand in ours. Already its
warmth can be felt with your
words...
A knock on the door. She looks over-EXT. HAMPTON COURT - DAY
Elizabeth comes outside to the front entrance, where Dudley
and Randolph are already sitting atop their respective
horses, ready to depart on a journey, GROOMS nearby.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Let us settle on a meeting place
before the summer brings
discomfort.
During the following, Elizabeth approaches Dudley. He looks
forlorn. Takes his hand in hers and kisses it.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Let our nations cherish each other
as we would - two Kingdoms united.
He opens his hand to find one of her quilled flowers within
it. It makes departing that much more difficult. She offers
him a bittersweet smile.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Meanwhile accept this portrait as a
sign of thanks for yours...
But Dudley does not return the smile. He cannot hide his
unhappiness at being charged with this mission.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
And please accept this suitor who
presents both his love and mine.
As he begins to ride away, Elizabeth turns to watch him go,
and as the camera comes around on her we CUT TO--

31A.

INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Dudley presents the portrait of Elizabeth to Mary. Randolph
is in attendance, as are Moray and Maitland. Mary is
delighted to receive the gift - beaming with excitement.

32.

ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...The Earl of Leicester - Lord
Robert Dudley.
Mary looks up from the portrait to address Randolph-MARY
Do you think it might stand with my
honour to marry my sister’s
subject?
RANDOLPH
(glancing to Dudley)
It is true that an Earl is not a
Prince...
We POP to Dudley, who looks miserable, then back to Randolph-RANDOLPH (CONT’D)
Surely there can be no greater
honour than to match yourself with
a Nobleman by whom you inherit such
a kingdom as England.
Moray perks up at this, as does Mary.
MARY
I have such inheritance by blood,
regardless of who I marry or do not
marry.
A provocation. Moray is anxious. Randolph remains cool.
MARY (CONT’D)
(to Dudley)
We must discuss succession before
marriage, not the other way around.
Randolph grits his teeth. This meeting is a failure for him.
MARY (CONT’D)
We hope we do not vex the Earl.
DUDLEY
Not in the least, Madam. I am
grateful for your honesty.
MARY
Were I not a prince, I could not
hope for a finer and more handsome
man than you.
DUDLEY
You save me from disgrace.
Off Mary’s look--

32A.

DUDLEY (CONT’D)
I would be no more than a wretch
compared to the beauty you possess.
Mary laughs. With a flirtatious smirk-MARY
We see why our cousin is so fond of
the Earl.
Then, on a dime, all business-MARY (CONT’D)
(to Randolph)
I shall respect Elizabeth’s crown
as soon as she names me its
successor.
RANDOLPH
The issue of succession is a-MARY
For two years now we have dallied
when the compromise could not be
clearer. Elizabeth need merely
agree to it.
RANDOLPH
Madam - my Queen will not be
pleased by your rebuff of the Earl
and your persistence regarding--

33.

MARY
If she has any concerns about this
proposal she may express them to me
directly. Plans proceed for us to
meet next month?
RANDOLPH
Aye, Madam. In York.
MARY
Very well. We shall accomplish far
more without envoys between us.
A slight to Randolph, and we can read it in his eyes. She
turns to Dudley again. Holding up the portrait of Elizabeth-MARY (CONT’D)
(back to Dudley)
How like is it unto your mistress’s
face?
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
Elizabeth is in bed. She looks pale and sickly. Bess wipes
her forehead with a damp rag as Cecil addresses her. Randolph
and Dudley are with him.
CECIL
You must not meet with her, Madam.
False affections are one matter,
but giving her audience is-ELIZABETH
What makes you think our affections
false?
Elizabeth’s voice is feeble from illness.
CECIL
Affections aside, she remains
obstinate.
(glances to Dudley)
And rebuffs your chosen one.
ELIZABETH
What sayst thou, Robert?
DUDLEY
(falling in line)
I agree with Cecil’s counsel.
RANDOLPH
We are all agreed Madam.
Elizabeth looks grim. Dudley gives a glance to Cecil,
indicating that perhaps they should go and let him handle
this.

33A.

CECIL
Rest well, Madam.
He and Randolph exit. Dudley remains. Sits down on the edge
of the bed and takes her hand and kisses it.

34.

ELIZABETH
You shouldn’t.
DUDLEY
I survived it as a boy.
ELIZABETH
And if I should not survive?
DUDLEY
You will.
ELIZABETH
And even so - if my face is
scarred, will you still love me?
DUDLEY
I would love you if you turned into
a fish.
Elizabeth starts to chuckle. Dudley brings his hands to the
sides of his neck to mimic a fish. She laughs more,
painfully. Then her brow furrows. Vulnerable-ELIZABETH
Is she as beautiful as I hear told?
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
TIGHT on Mary’s face, windswept and vigorous, as she rides
through the lush, late spring countryside. Her entire
entourage is on the move. We see her taking in the beauty of
the land, a smile on her face as she basks in the sun.
The spell is broken by-BOTHWELL
Halt.
The entire party comes to a stop. Mary looks ahead and sees a
contingent of three horsemen galloping toward them from down
the road. Two appear to be soldier escorts. Bothwell races
ahead with four horseman of the Royal Guard to intercept.
As Bothwell’s contingent nears the foreigners they come to a
stop. From Mary’s POV we can barely make out that one of them
is Randolph.
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
The Royal entourage is in the background. Mary walks through
a field of grass and wildflowers at some distance, Randolph
next to her, Moray and Maitland several steps behind.

35.

MARY
Could her Council not wait until
her return?
RANDOLPH
Their business was urgent, Madam.
The Huguenots sent an envoy.
MARY
(concerned)
And she receives them?
RANDOLPH
England wishes no more bloodshed.
Being from France you must
understand.
MARY
You may tell my sister that we pray
for swift peace, that we may meet
soon.
RANDOLPH
I will tell her at once.
MARY
Stay with us the night back at
Holyrood. I’m certain Mistress
Beaton would welcome your company.
Randolph blushes at the insinuation..
RANDOLPH
Thank you, Madam.
TIME CUT TO-Mary walking with Moray and Maitland toward the carriage as
the entire entourage is being turned around for the journey
back. Three of her ladies - Seton, Livingston and Fleming are
close behind. Beaton is a bit farther back, walking with
Randolph as he leads his horse on foot.
MAITLAND
She hides behind her Council.
MARY
You do not think she postpones...
MORAY
I think she has no intention to
meet until you recognise her
legitimacy.
MARY
(sinking in)
A false promise then.

35A.

MAITLAND
Retaliation perhaps, for refusing
the treaty.
MARY
For refusing Dudley.
Off Maitland’s look.
MARY (CONT’D)
This is a matter of the heart, not
the state. They don’t mix well.
She glances back at Beaton and Randolph. They are smiling and
happy. Then turns to the ladies.
MARY (CONT’D)
Wouldn’t you say, Mistress Fleming?
FLEMING
Pardon me, Madam?
MARY
(gesturing to Maitland)
I speak of the state...
(gesturing to Fleming)
...and of the heart.
FLEMING
I am afraid I don’t understand...
MAITLAND
(bristling)
Your mistress mocks our affections.
MARY
Not so. They sometimes have
value...
As she returns to her horse she steals one more glance at
Beaton and Randolph.

36.

EXT. HOLYROOD - SECLUDED AREA - NIGHT
Randolph and Beaton are in the shadows - groping, kissing,
rough and lustful. After several moments of this, Beaton
squirms loose.
BEATON
It’s late. I must attend to my
mistress.
He tries to kiss her again but she holds him off.
BEATON (CONT’D)
Think of your wife.
He sighs. Just as she pulls away he grabs her wrist-RANDOLPH
Nothing we spoke of...
BEATON
Of course not.

37.

With a smile she leans forward and gives him one last kiss.
He lets go. She walks off. As she rounds the corner to a new
corridor she picks up pace, walking more and more briskly.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Beaton enters, breathless. Mary is being undressed by the
three other Marys.
BEATON
The pox, Madam.
Off their looks-BEATON (CONT’D)
There is no envoy. She has the pox.
On Mary. This changes everything.
MARY
How grave?
BEATON
Quite grave.
MARY
(to Beaton)
Go rouse my brother.
As Beaton exits, to the other three-MARY (CONT’D)
Back on with it.
They hasten to re-dress her. Mary’s thoughts are swirling.
Several beats as she traverses exhilaration to doubt-MARY (CONT’D)
Do you think me sinful?
SETON
How so?
MARY
My excitement.
LIVINGSTON
C’est Dieu qui la rend malade.
(It is God who makes her ill.)
MARY
(in French, to herself)
Oui, c’est Dieu.
(Yes, God.)
(in English)
He has his plan...

38.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
TIGHT on Rizzio as he transcribes with the scratch of a quill
against parchment. Moray looking over his shoulder. The room
is lit by only candles, giving it a conspiratorial feel.
MARY (O.S.)
It will please you to know that I
have warmed to the prospect of
wedding Lord Dudley. We shall do
so...
Rizzio dips his quill in the ink. We PULL BACK to see Mary
dictating the letter-MARY (CONT’D)
...upon one condition.
She waits for Rizzio to catch up, then-MARY (CONT’D)
While we wish you a long and
healthy life, and that no injury or
illness befall you, we shall only
do you the favour of betrothing
your special friend...
Rizzio is writing furiously. Once again Mary waits for him to
catch up. She stands and goes over to Rizzio so that she may
look over his shoulder as Moray and Maitland are doing-MARY (CONT’D)
...once you name us heir.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
Elizabeth is covered now with small pox boils. She is
attended to by Bess as two other ladies keep vigil as she
reads the letter from Mary.
ELIZABETH
(in a whisper, to herself)
She knows...
BESS
Madam...?
Leaping to another thought, this one fueled by jealousy-ELIZABETH
My “special friend”...she taunts
us.
Her gut is churning; she’s half delirious from her illness--

39.

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
She wants him as her own. My
Robert. My crown...
PRELAP the clashing of fencing sabers as we CUT TO--

INT. HAMPTON COURT - LONG GALLERY - DAY
A number of NOBLES are stripped down to their undershirts,
fencing in pairs down the length of the gallery as others
look on. In one pair is Dudley. In another is Darnley. The
door flings open, revealing Elizabeth.
The fencers cease. Everyone stares at her - surprised to see
their Queen enter unannounced and in such a sorry state.
ELIZABETH
Out.
The Nobles begin to disperse, the fencers setting down their
foils as they go. Some are stealing glances at Elizabeth as
they exit, particularly Darnley. Dudley approaches her,
concerned-She hands him the letter. He begins to read. Looks up at her.
He lifts her veil so he can see her better. She looks
stricken, on the verge of tears. Her eyes say “You must not
leave me.”
DUDLEY
I am yours. Forever yours.
ELIZABETH
But how? Am I to refuse her what I
myself suggested.
Her tears begin to fall. Dudley embraces her to console her.
She would normally feel embarrassed by such an outward sign
of emotion, but not in his arms. After a beat, in a whisper-DUDLEY
There is a way to right this...
She looks to him - expectant, hopeful-DUDLEY (CONT’D)
The boy, who was fencing nearest to
the door.
ELIZABETH
I took no notice.

40.

DUDLEY
Darnley, son of Lennox...

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
TIGHT on Mary, two hands covering her eyes. Giggles in the
background. She’s smiling. We PULL BACK to see that Beaton is
covering her eyes from behind.
FLEMING
Now.
Beaton removes her hands. We CUT TO Mary’s POV: Fleming and
Livingston are holding one of Mary’s dresses up to Rizzio,
fanning out the hem, Seton holding the blouse up to his
chest.
Rizzio begins to twirl as if dancing the masque with
effeminate physicality, the three women keeping the dress and
blouse against him as he does, singing in a falsetto. Mary
laughs as do the other women.
MARY
You look exquisite, Mademoiselle.
Rizzo curtsies, with a feminine voice-RIZZIO
Is it a sin that I feel more a
sister to you than a brother?
The smiles of the women fade. Rizzio instantly backtracks.
RIZZIO (CONT’D)
(standing)
Forgive me. I forget myself in your
company.
But Mary wants to relieve him of his shame.
MARY
Be whoever you wish with us. You
make for a lovely sister.
(to the ladies)
Doesn’t she?
The other ladies nod, feeling free to smile once again. We
can sense Rizzio appreciates their acceptance. A knock at the
door. The ladies instantly pull the dress away from Rizzio.
MARY (CONT’D)
Enter.

41.

The door opens, revealing Moray and an Attendant. He glances
to Rizzio warily, then to Mary-MORAY
We have visitors.
He hands Mary a letter from Elizabeth. She reads over it
quickly - looks up at him, puzzled.
MARY
They are Stuarts...
MORAY
Aye.

INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
As an ATTENDANT shows Darnley and Lennox in, sotto voce-LENNOX
I shall talk. You say nothing.
DARNLEY
Not even to-LENNOX
Silence.
The Attendant steps aside. What Lennox and Darnley see are
Mary and the Four Marys on common stools. They are all
dressed similarly, Mary no different than the others. Moray
and Maitland are to the side.
MORAY
The 4th Earl of Lennox...
Lennox bows.
MORAY (CONT’D)
His son Henry, Lord Darnley.
Darnley bows. Lennox expects the Queen to say something, but
he cannot tell which of the five women is Mary. He looks to
Moray and Maitland for assistance. They are statues. He looks
to the Attendant, who says nothing. It’s an embarrassing
position to be in. But neither offers guidance. He looks back
to the Ladies.
LENNOX
Forgive me - I do not know my
Queen’s visage.
He gets no help from anyone. Lennox looks helplessly from one
Lady to the next.

42.

He laughs nervously, both flummoxed and insulted. But Darnley
is amused, and more than game to play. He walks forward
brazenly.
DARNLEY
Let me, father.
As he speaks he circles the women slowly, considering them.
His charisma is electric, amplified by how closely he orbits,
almost brushing up against the women, his proximity and the
chance of physical contact so acute it’s thrilling. He speaks
slowly, confidently - his voice intoxicating - we see the
womens’ chests rising and falling, titillated. Darnley
continues to circle them...
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
I give you verse, unsheathing my
quick wit...to see which among you
it quickens.
Giggles from the ladies. Moray and Maitland remain icy cold.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
But should I fail to choose
correctly...
As he comes around the front of them again, he places his
hand on his chest, feigning sorrow-DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Tis my soul that will be sickened.
They smile at his performance, thoroughly charmed.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
For shame returning to my native
land...Only to be deprived of
kissing...
Now he stops and kneels before Seton...
But at the last moment he turns to Mary, takes her hand-DARNLEY (CONT’D)
...my Queen’s perfect hand.
He bends forward and gives her hand a tender kiss. The other
Marys clap with approval. Darnley rises and bows.
MARY
How did you know?
DARNLEY
You held your breath when I was
about to err.

43.

EXT. HOLYROOD - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Mary and Darnley walking alone, the Four Marys trailing in
the distance-DARNLEY
The request was ours and she was
kind enough to grant us passage.
Here we can worship as we choose.
MARY
I doubt tis faith that brings you.
Rather the lands your father seeks.
Or even the throne.
DARNLEY
The throne?
MARY
Why would Elizabeth grant you
passports if she did not intend you
as a suitor? And by laying suit to
me does not the House of Lennox lay
suit to all of Scotland?
Darnley chuckles. Mary is offended. She stops, turns to him.
MARY (CONT’D)
I amuse you.
DARNLEY
Aye.
(A beat)
Madam - you must not be Elizabeth.
MARY
How so?
DARNLEY
The woman lives in fright - always
suspecting intrigue, always fearful
of revolt.
MARY
Her fears are wise. We both have
Nobles who would have us deposed.
Darnley takes the scolding without showing an ounce of
regret. The opposite. He smiles back at her.
DARNLEY
Have I vexed you?

44.

Mary self-consciously brings her fingers to her cheek and
turns away. Darnley places a hand on her face and turns her
towards him. It’s an incredibly bold gesture.
MARY
You dare touch a sovereign without
her permission?
Though she says this, she makes no effort to remove his hand.
DARNLEY
I can speak for neither my father
nor Elizabeth. Only for myself.
He moves his hand so that his palm rests on her cheek.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
And speaking for myself, you have a
loyal subject in your Henry, who
would rather worship at your feet
than at a Catholic mass.
He leans in to kiss her on the lips. She turns her head away
just before his lips reach hers. Continues walking, her chest
heaving from the close encounter.
Darnley begins to follow, several steps behind.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
I shall keep walking with you then,
until you object.
Mary keeps walking, unsure how to answer, a swirl of emotion.
Darnley catches up. Offers his arm. She takes it. And they
continue to walk in silence - Mary’s vigilant mind battling
with the longing in her body.
We hear the sound of lute strings being plucked and CUT TO--

INT. HOLYROOD - STAIRWELL/HALLWAY - NIGHT
Seton leads Darnley up a spiral staircase by candlelight. As
they reach the top of the stairs she pauses, seeing shadows.
Gestures for Darnley to stop. Blows out her candle.
Two Nobles pass in the hallway, not seeing Seton and Darnley
in the shadows of the stairwell. Once they have passed, she
gestures for Darnley to follow, and they continue on.

45.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Rizzio plucking the strings casually. The Marys (minus Seton)
are attending to Mary, powdering her face, combing her hair,
dabbing her wrists and neck with oils. Rizzio looks on as he
plays, a smile of appreciation at her beauty.
Mary’s eyes shine with anticipation and anxiety. The Marys
step away to have a look at their labors. Rizzio - continuing
to play-RIZZIO
You glow, Madam.
TIME CUT to Seton knocking on the door from the outside to
make those within aware of their arrival.
Seton and Darnley enter. The Marys curtsy and promptly exit.
Rizzio stays. Mary is not in sight.
TIME CUT to Rizzio helping Darnley remove his collar, his
sleeves and his doublet, so that he is only wearing his
undershirt and breeches. Then Rizzio gestures to the bed-DARNLEY
You remain?
RIZZIO
The Queen scarcely knows your
grace.
Rizzio picks up his lute, nearby.
RIZZIO (CONT’D)
But I shall play, and hear nothing.
Darnley circuits the bed to the other side, where the drapes
are drawn open. Mary sits atop the bed, knees beneath her,
looking resplendent.
Rizzio perches himself on a stool and begins to pluck the
lute once more, his fingers matching the music that has
continued to play throughout the sequence thus far.
We CUT BACK to the far side of the bed. Darnley is still
taking in Mary’s beauty.
MARY
(nodding to a side table)
There is wine if you desire it.
Darnley fetches the bottle and pours a goblet. As he does-MARY (CONT’D)
When I refused you. I wish...
She averts her eyes. She does not want to admit it. Glances
at the goblet of wine.

46.

MARY (CONT’D)
May I have some?
He holds out the goblet. She reaches for it. But when her
hand wraps around it, he places his other hand on hers.
Caresses her fingers with his. An intake of air from Mary.
He slides her hand over the goblets rim, dipping her fingers
within. Then brings her fingers to his lips and glosses them
wet with the sherry. Her mouth is parted, her breath
quickening. His hand still on her wrist, he gently pulls her
forward.
She closes her eyes and places her mouth on his. Then moves
the tip of her tongue along the length of his lips, savouring
the wine on the tender flesh.
He runs his hand through the hair at the nape of her neck and
pulls her closer still, so that now her lips are fully
pressed against his.
TIME CUTS as we see kissing grow more passionate. Mary is
giving into a hunger she hasn’t indulged before - except with
François, who wasn’t up to the task. There’s a ferocity to
her desire, increasingly confident and instinctual.
We see her run her hand along his leg, then between his
thighs. When it finds its mark she pulls back.
DARNLEY
What’s wrong?
MARY
Do you not...desire me?
Darnley doesn’t waste a moment.
DARNLEY
Lie back.
He gently lays her back. Kisses her collar bone, then her
chest. Makes his way down to the folds of her dress. Pushing
them up along her bare legs.
She starts to retreat, grabbing his head by the hair and
pulling him up.
MARY
We cannot...
DARNLEY
We won’t. I promise you. This is
not that.
She’s confused - not sure what he means.

47.

DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Have faith in me. Do you have
faith?
She’s unsure but she wants to trust him. The fearless side of
her takes over. She nods.
Darnley lowers himself again, his mouth against the thin
fabric of her gown wrought between her thighs.
We CUT TO TIGHT on her face as she gasps, his mouth alighting
her through the gown, an intense sensation beyond which any
she thought possible, and she is utterly lost in it. We CUT
TO-her hand clawing at the sheets
her teeth clenched as she sucks in air
her torso twisting
her eyes widening
her back arching
her face as she convulses, gasping
As her body shivers - the after shocks still rippling through
her, Darnley slides up beside her.
MARY
Do you need to...?
DARNLEY
No. Don’t worry about me.
He gets up and pours two goblets. Walks around to the other
side of the bed where Rizzio is still plucking. Sets one
goblet down for Rizzio. They lock eyes.
Then Darnley heads back around and sits down in a chair.
Takes a sip as he looks over to Mary, who is now on her side,
her back to him.
On Mary, heart pounding, slipping into reverie, but also
trying to process what just occurred.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Elizabeth at the head of the table, her counsellors
assembled. She has recovered from her small pox, but she
still looks pale and thin, and right now she is on the
defensive. Cecil and Dudley are in attendance.
CECIL
Without a treaty signed, this union
strengthens her claim.
ELIZABETH
You need not condescend. We are
well informed.

48.

CECIL
Forgive us. We merely seek to
protect your crown.
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Mary rides on horseback, flanked by Moray and Maitland and a
small party of Nobles and Guards in tow. They are on a daytrip to Arthur’s Seat.
MAITLAND
You cannot wed him, Madam.
MARY
I do not wed him blindly. He has
promised no ambition.
MAITLAND
He understands that he would only
be your consort? Not a King
outright?
MARY
He does.
MAITLAND
I find it difficult to believe that
any man would settle for as much.
We INTERCUT between these two scenes-INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER
RANDOLPH
Two Catholics wed. Two Stuarts,
Madam...
CECIL
He has a claim of his own, even
without betrothal. Together they
make a union of two claims.
ELIZABETH
She has a chosen an Englishman, as
I asked. What recourse do I have?
CECIL
Implore her to marry Lord Dudley.
He was your first choice.
Elizabeth looks to Dudley, who looks back sympathetically.

49.

EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
MARY
Dudley is her puppet. He offers no
advantage.
MAITLAND
Unless she promises to make you
heir.
MARY
(blood up)
Where is this promise? That has
failed to appear these past four
years?
INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER
ELIZABETH
I will not offer my Lord if it
means naming her successor.
RANDOLPH
She will not accept him otherwise.
ELIZABETH
Then let her refuse him.
CECIL
On succession I agree. But Darnley
imperils us more.
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
MORAY
He would provoke revolt among our
Nobles.
MARY
(a sharp blow)
Do you command so little respect
that you could not discourage them?
INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER
CECIL
We must not delay. You must forbid
this marriage.
On Elizabeth, pondering this. Then she abruptly stands. The
Councillors follow suit. She exits without another word.
Cecil turns to Dudley with venom on his tongue.
CECIL (CONT’D)
What chaos you have brought to us.

50.

EXT. ARTHUR’S SEAT - DAY
Mary and the others are nearing the crest. On Darnley
galloping fast on his horse past the other Nobles.
He whirls around on his horse as he gets to Mary, cantering
and stepping his horse sideways before her.
Moray and Maitland eye him with the same contempt with which
Cecil beheld Dudley.
DARNLEY
(pointing ahead)
Is that the top?
MAITLAND
Aye.
As he turns his horse to trot ahead-MORAY
No subject should ride before his
Queen.
Darnley glances back. It’s a barbed comment, reminding him
that would he marry the Queen he is still but a subject. Mary
dispels any conflict by trotting ahead of Darnley.
MARY
Would he?
DARNLEY
Though he would.
Mary starts to pick up speed. Darnley accepts the challenge,
keeping near, just a neck behind her. And now the two are
galloping up the crest, a thunder of hooves between their two
horses.
CUT TO Mary and Darnley alone atop their horses at the crest
of Arthur’s Seat. Edinburgh and the countryside beyond
stretches out before them.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
How it must feel...to rule all that
is within your sight.
MARY
I am but its servant.
Darnley looks to her, not quite understanding. She continues
to gaze out at the view beneath. He looks back out. A beat,
and now she turns to him.
MARY (CONT’D)
Are you prepared to be its servant?

51.

Looking back at her, eyes ablaze. Does she mean what he
thinks she means?
DARNLEY
It is right for the man to ask.
MARY
Then ask.
He takes her hand and brings it to his mouth, softly...
DARNLEY
Before God...
Kisses her hand lightly...
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Before all of Scotland...
He leans in, whispers in her ear...
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Before all the world...
He kisses the side of her neck. The touch of his lips sends
a jolt through her-MARY
Yes.
Into her ear again-DARNLEY
You will be my Queen?
MARY
Yes.
DARNLEY
And I your King?
MARY
Yes.
And whispering into her ear-DARNLEY
Your master.
She pulls back and looks him in the eye. A slight correction,
but smiling-MARY
My husband.
He laughs - giddy, joyful, not necessarily absorbing the
correction for what it was.

52.

She laughs in return, squeezes his hand. They both turn and
once again gaze out upon the view together.
INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Randolph stands before Mary, Moray and Maitland are present.
RANDOLPH
They are English subjects, Madam.
If my Queen orders their return,
they must.
MARY
She asked that I marry an English
Nobleman. And now she deprives me?
RANDOLPH
Her wish is that you should not
marry this particular noble.
MARY
You may tell your mistress I shall
do so, with or without her
blessing.
RANDOLPH
Madam - before you act rashly,
please consider-MARY
It is enough my own Lords treat me
as though I’m but a girl...
On Moray, about to step forward, but Maitland holds him back.
MARY (CONT’D)
I will not be treated as such by
Elizabeth. I will be the woman she
is not. I shall produce an heir,
unlike her barren self.
Randolph is stunned silent and paralyzed.
MARY (CONT’D)
(to an Attendant)
Prepare the Ambassador’s horse.
Randolph bows and makes for his exit. As he passes Beaton she
averts her eyes so as not to make contact with his. As soon
as he is gone, Moray steps forward, incensed.
MORAY
(temper flaring)
Reckless child.
(MORE)

52A.

MORAY (CONT'D)
I have worked too long and too hard
with too much bloodshed to secure
peace in our land. Do not let your
cursèd passion rule you.

53.

MARY
(calm and cold)
Tis your voice raised, sir. And you
would lower it in my presence.
Moray has reached the breaking point, but he lowers his voice
- speaking slowly and purposefully.
MORAY
If my counsel no longer has value,
then I am obliged to withdraw from
court.
MARY
If you must.
Whether he is bluffing or not, she has called it. And from
the resoluteness in her eyes, both we and Moray know she is
not bluffing in response.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - ROOFTOP - DAY
A cold day. Both Elizabeth and Cecil are bundled up. Grey,
discomforting skies.
CECIL (O.S.)
You have neither husband nor
children. And you approach an age
whereupon you cannot bear them...
Elizabeth looks out to the horizon, despondent.
CECIL (CONT’D)
You must confront the truth, Madam.
Displeasing as it may be.
In a softer tone, more as a friend than a councillor-CECIL (CONT’D)
I have confronted that truth.
She turns to him, surprised by the admission. Also softly-ELIZABETH
You understand that I cannot.
CECIL
Will not. And I accept it. Do I
understand...?
CECIL (CONT’D)
No more than I understand God.
ELIZABETH
It is my choice. God would have a
woman be a wife and mother.

54.

Observational, not accusatory-CECIL
So you defy his will.
ELIZABETH
No - I choose to be a man.
Off his look. He still fails to fathom her-ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
As children dream in their sleep
after apples and in the morning,
when they awake and find not the
apples, they weep. Such a man as I
might marry, finding himself
disappointed, would not stop at
weeping.
CECIL
(finishing her thought)
He would conspire.
ELIZABETH
No Prince's revenues be so great
that they are able to satisfy the
insatiable cupidity of men.
CECIL
This I understand.
ELIZABETH
Which is why you are the closest
thing I shall ever have to a wife.
He laughs at this. It’s a tender, intimate moment.
CECIL
I shan’t mention your proposal to
Lord Dudley.
She laughs at this in return.
ELIZABETH
Come and take my hand.
He comes over and takes her hand. It doesn’t feel romantic.
It feels fraternal.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I would be lost without you.
And now it’s he who looks out to the horizon.
CECIL
My father despised my first wife.
Her name was Mary...

55.

ELIZABETH
There are no shortage of those.
CECIL
(chuckles)
Indeed not.
ELIZABETH
Despised her why?
CECIL
I married her for love.
(beat)
It was foolish. She had no wealth
or influence. But I adored her. And
when she died - it left me...
He shakes his head, not wanting to complete the memory. But
in his eyes we can see the devastation her death wrought.
Elizabeth squeezes his hand. He forces the thought out of his
mind. His familiar coolness returns.
CECIL (CONT’D)
This world is a brutal place. It
has no patience for such
foolishness.
(turns to her)
We men must be wiser, mustn’t we?
ELIZABETH
Tell me what to do.
CECIL
We must make civil war in Scotland.
Elizabeth ponders this, brow furrowed, eyes darkening. Their
affection has shifted back into realpolitik. Elizabeth
removes her hand from Cecil’s.
ELIZABETH
You would have me depose a sister
monarch?
CECIL
It is either civil war there. Or
civil war here.
ON Elizabeth, weary. But a cold resolution comes over her.
Cecil has seen this look before. It’s what he hoped for.
ELIZABETH
I want to know nothing of it.
CECIL
The arrangements shall be mine
alone.
On Elizabeth’s face as we hear the sound of BAG PIPES...

56.

INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
TIGHT on Mary’s hand - three royal marriage rings upon it DARNLEY’S hand enters frame, similarly ringed. Mary places
her hand on his. Drums strike up the dance.
Pull back to reveal MARY and DARNLEY standing alone in the
centre of the hall hand on hand. The wedding banquet is over,
the tables are pushed back and the wedding guests stand
around the hall watching.
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - SHORE - DAY
A fishing trawler is being dragged on the shore, its goods
covered in burlap to shield them from the rain. Nearby on a
rise are the silhouettes of half a dozen hooded men on
horseback. They begin to gallop down toward the wagons.
INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
The wedding dance continues and Mary and Darnley are joined
by BETON, SETON & LIVINGSTON and their dance partners.
FLEMING encourages MAITLAND to join the dance but he resists.
MARY notices MAITLAND. Other nobles decline to dance and look
on disapprovingly.
Mary remains regal despite the lack of enthusiasm, although
we can sense it bothers her. Darnley, is less able to hide
his displeasure.
INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
DARNLEY downs his drink in one gulp and gestures to his
servant to refill his goblet.
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - SHORE - DAY
One of the six horseman pulls back the burlap covering boat.
We see nothing but hay until the Wagon Driver pushes it aside
and reveals a cache of pikes, swords, crossbows and muskets.
We also see a small trunk. The Nobleman opens it. The trunk
is full of gold and silver coins. One of the other men steps
forward to take a closer look. And within the hood we see
that it is Lord Moray.
INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
Thirty Male Guests dance in lines with military precision.
It’s quite formal choreography. But a very drunk Darnley
inserts himself into the dance, sloppy and grinning. He is
trying to get the dancers to bow to him, the king.

56A.

The Dancers attempt to continue, but it’s difficult to
navigate around him. On Mary, embarrassed by her husband. She
looks over to Rizzio, who is strumming his lute. Something
should be done.
Rizzio takes the cue. He strolls toward Darnley, still
strumming, in a half-walk, half-dance - circles Darnley as
though it’s all part of the choreography, then brings his
arms around Darnley from behind, placing the lute at his
chest, as though his arms are Darnley’s arms. Everyone
laughs. It’s a comedic and graceful way to get Darnley out of
the way. He spins Darnley as he’s strumming, walking him off
to the side, almost as if all of it were planned.

57.

EXT. SALT MARSH - DAY
As the drums continue over the pipes we see foot soldiers
marching in a column.
INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
On Mary watching something. We CUT TO her POV:
It’s Darnley and Rizzio off to the side of the room, Darnley
on Rizzio’s lap, drunkenly letting him play the lute,
laughing and plucking the strings himself.
BACK ON Mary, perturbed by both Darnley’s drunkenness and
Rizzio’s familiarity with him.
EXT. SALT MARSH - OUTDOOR MASS - DAY
A continuation of Scene 78. The column of rebel soldiers
passes by Knox, Moray with him. Knox is giving blessings as
they march past him, palm raised, mouthing “Bless you” and
“In service of the Lord.”

INT. HOLYROOD - DARNLEY’S CHAMBER - DAY
TIGHT on Darnley’s face. He is passed out on his bed. A hand
SLAPS his face.

58.

And with the slap the pipes and drums stop.
Darnley opens his eyes, squinting. Sees Mary standing before
him. We see that Rizzio lays in the bed next to Darnley.
Rizzio is stirring now. Is horrified to see Mary.
MARY
(to Darnley)
Rise and prepare yourself.
As Darnley sits up he sees Bothwell in the door. Is surprised
to see him in his Royal Chamber.
DARNLEY
Be gone.
But Bothwell doesn’t budge.
MARY
(turns to Bothwell)
He is in your care.
EXT. HOLYROOD - THE COURTYARD (UPPER) - DAY
An OFFICER is showing her how to load and cock a pistol. He
aims it at the wall and fires. With a loud BANG and puff of
smoke the lead ball leaves a small crater in the plastered
facade. He turns back to Mary.
MARY
Now I shall try.
He hands her the pistol, bag of gunpowder and a lead ball. As
she prepares the pistol for it’s next shot, Rizzio - now
dressed - emerges from within and approaches her. Livingston
intercepts him to prevent him getting to Mary.
LIVINGTON
Rentre! Tu n’es pas digne de son
regard.
(Go back inside. You are not worthy
of her eyes).
RIZZIO
Please...
LIVINGSTON
Non. Misérable! Canaille!
(No. You wretch. You dog).
(to the Guards)
Battez-le comme un chien s’il
s’approche encore plus.
(He should be beaten like a dog if
he draws nearer).
But he tries anyway.

58A.

RIZZIO
A word - a moment...
Several Guards step forward to block him. Mary, witnessing
all of this as she loads the pistol, finally speaks up-MARY
Let him approach.
The Guards step aside. Rizzio approaches her sheepishly. Then
falls to his knees in front of her.
RIZZIO
(in a whisper)
To have betrayed you in this way I have no excuse - And I beg...I
beg that...
She keeps her voice low as well. With some gentleness-MARY
Stand.

59.

He does.
MARY (CONT’D)
You have not betrayed your nature.
He is anguished by her kindness.
MARY (CONT’D)
I cannot fault you for succumbing
to his charms as I did.
(beat)
But we must be more careful now.
He nods, grateful for her mercy. She raises the pistol and
aims at the wall. She pulls the trigger and BANG...
On which we CUT TO-EXT. MARY’S CAMP - DAY

Mary rides at the vanguard. She is fitted with armour and a
steel cap on her head, pistol in a saddle holster. Bothwell
is similarly armoured and armed.
Darnley rides a few yards behind them, wearing a gilded
breastplate, looking pale and weary.
Mary looks vibrant and at ease. She seems in her element, on
the move, the head of an army 10,000 soldiers strong.
BOTHWELL
Moray is marching southwest, toward
Dumfries.
MARY
The English can easily supply them
there...
BOTHWELL
If we make good time we could cut
them off before they reach the
gates. Or we fortify here and
prepare for a siege, blocking the
road south.
MARY
What would you have us do?
BOTHWELL
Meet them and end this now.
DARNLEY
Why give chase? Let them starve
behind the walls of Dumfries.

59A.

BOTHWELL
If we lose sight, they could flank
us. I want to flank them first.
There’s a bridge they must use to
cross Annan.
MARY
How far?
BOTHWELL
Two days. But I can get us there in
one.
MARY
Give the order.
Bothwell turns his horse around and begins riding down the
line, shouting the order for a quickstep. The entire column
begins to pick up speed, the foot soldiers marching more
briskly. Mary wheels her horse around to follow Bothwell down
the line.
DARNLEY
Why give chase? Let them come to
us.
MARY
Are you afraid Henry?
DARNLEY
No...
MARY
Good. Because our swords are not
just for show.

60.

And she yanks on the reins, trotting down the line. Off
Darnley, emasculated and alienated.
TIME CUT to Mary on foot, leading her horse by the reins,
walking side by side with the common foot soldiers. As they
walk briskly past her they each lower their heads out of
respect. Three YOUNG SOLDIERS walk past. They look no older
than 16. They’re shy when she addresses them.
MARY (CONT’D)
Whence come you?
URIE CAMPBELL
The Highlands, Madam. These two
from Inverness. I’m from Thurso.
MARY
Fishermen?
URIE CAMPBELL
Aye.
MARY
I am sorry we have only mutton.
Two of the boys smile shyly at this. The third (HECTOR
MACLEAN), just smiles at seeing the other two laugh.
JAMES MACDONALD
We are happy to have anything to
eat, Madam.
MARY
Catholic?
JAMES MACDONALD
(nervously)
No, Madam.
She looks to Urie. He shakes his head.
MARY
(to Hector)
And you?
URIE CAMPBELL
He don’t know Scots, Madam. Only
Gaelic.

61.

MARY
Tell him I’m grateful for his
service.
URIE CAMPBELL
Tha a’ bhanrigh taingeil airson do
sheirbheis.
HECTOR MACLEAN
Tha e moiteil a bhi na shearbhant
don bhan righ agus tha e deonach
basachadh air a son.
URIE CAMPBELL
He says he’s proud to serve his
Queen. And to give his life if he
must.
MARY
Tell him: If any of us should die
today, we all go to the same
heaven.
URIE CAMPBELL
Ma bhasaicheas duine againn an
diugh, theid sinn dhan aon Neamh!
Hector smiles at her and makes the sign of the cross. On
Mary, grateful and inspired by the show of loyalty as they
continue walking onward.
EXT. COPSE OF TREES - DAY
It’s getting late in the afternoon now. We hear the steady
beat of a REBEL DRUMMER giving tempo to the march. An
impatient Moray berates his men.
From a mound covered in twisted pine, we see the men trudge
along a curved track. Ahead of them is a bridge, which fords
a fast-flowing river. Moray and his men are on its West Bank.
This, unbeknownst to Moray, is MARY’s point of view.
The air is heavy with midges. The soldiers are fatigued
lugging expensive, heavy muskets and weaponry: Cecil’s
supplies. Moray rides up and down the line, driving the
troops forward. Frustrated, he commands the Rebel Drummer to
pick up the tempo.
MORAY
Double it.
The Rebel Drummer switches to a quick-step beat. The men
start to pick up their feet. Again we see the track from
above, where the road curves away from us at each end. MORAY
spots an oncoming obstruction heading towards the bridge from
the East Bank of the river: a herd of Highland Cattle and
four DROVERS.

61A.

MORAY (CONT’D)
(to the Rebel Drummer)
Halt.
The Rebel Drummer performs a flourish and stops drumming. The
troops halt. Moray and MORAY’S SECOND ride forward to prevent
the cattle from blocking the bridge.
MORAY (CONT’D)
Stand aside. We must pass.
The four Drovers ignore his shouts and, as Moray and Moray’s
Second reach the East Bank, the cattle flow around them,
blocking the bridge and stranding Moray and Moray’s Second on
the East Bank.
As the herd of cattle flow across the bridge, the first of
three loud, slow drumbeats is heard. At the first beat, the
Rebel Army stutter forward. Mistaking the drumbeat for his
Rebel Drummer-MORAY (CONT’D)
Halt I say!
But the drum beat comes from JAMES MACDONALD, Mary’s drummer,
who stands by MARY above the track.
With the second, slow drumbeat, the Rebel Drummer looks
around. It’s not him. Where is it coming from? He panics,
throwing off his drum to aid his retreat. The panic is
beginning to spread. What’s going on? This is an ambush.
The third beat coincides with an order from Moray’s Second-MORAY’S SECOND
Form up! Form up-Mid-shout, he is unhorsed by a DROVER, who swings at him with
his droving stick. Mary’s men fall from above. It is a
Highland charge. Deadly, simple, they stream down the hill
from where MARY commands them, driving Moray’s men into the
river. Moray’s men try to mount their heavy muskets and take
aim but the Mary’s men are upon them.
URIE CAMPBELL and HECTOR MACLEAN charge down the hill, Urie
spots a musket take aim at Hector and pushes him out of the
way, they both slip down the slope, avoiding the musket fire,
find their feet and charge onwards.
Moray’s men are hit hard from Mary’s side and driven into the
river. Escaping to the East Bank, they are met by more of
Mary’s men, who have lain in wait, anticipating the men in
the river.
Marooned on the bridge, in the midst of Highland cattle,
Moray looks from side to side of the bridge and sees his
soldiers and their heavy equipment being lost and slaughtered
in the river.

62.

He sees his precious guns and powder floating and MORAY tries
to hack his way out of the cattle, attempting to get back to
his side.
Seeing Moray slashing his way through the Highland cattle,
Bothwell leaves Mary’s side. Moray arrives back at the West
Bank, just to find his army deserting up the road away from
him. He is confronted by Bothwell, charging down the track
towards Moray. As Bothwell streams through the retreating
soldiers, he dispatches three men, slicing through them.
Moray panics, his trembling hands trying to load his gun.
Back to Bothwell riding him down. In his panic Moray drops
his gun, Bothwell is seconds from him. Just before impact,
Mary raises her hand. A bugle gives Bothwell the instruction
to halt. Bothwell pulls up, nose to nose with Moray. Moray
sees Mary on her mound, realising that she has masterminded
the whole ambush. He looks back to Bothwell, who backs away,
ushering Moray down the track to his retreat.
In the river, we see Moray’s drum floating towards us as his
men flee. Moray rears his horse with one last look to Mary,
then gallops away in flight with his men.
On Mary. She does not need to slaughter her brother or give
chase. She has accomplished what she needs to.

63.

INT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Mary rides triumphantly at the head of her column, glowing
from her victory. Down the line, Soldier #3 leads a Gaelic
chant. A rough and lovely song of praise. The whole troop
joins in. Mary glances over at Darnley, who is waving back,
accepting their affirmation.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary is being undressed by the Four Marys. They’re almost
finished when there is a knock at the door. It opens,
revealing Darnley. He’s visibly inebriated.
DARNLEY
You summoned?
Mary nods to the Four Marys, who quickly exit. They close the
door behind them.
MARY
How much have you had?
DARNLEY
Celebrating our victory, my love.
She goes to him - all business - and begins to unbutton the
fly on his breeches.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
She slides her hand in and begins to stroke him. He pulls
away. She places a hand on his chest. Gently-MARY
Close your eyes.
He does. She continues to stroke.
MARY (CONT’D)
You’re almost there.
DARNLEY
I can’t...I’ve had too much to
drink...

64.

MARY
Think of Rizzio.
He opens his eyes, furious. Slaps her hard in the face. She
reels, placing a hand to her cheek. He gets up and grabs her
by the wrist. Pulls her over to the bed and bends her over,
pressing her face down into the sheets.
While he’s holding her down he begins to jerk himself, to get
himself hard enough. Mary does not struggle. She wants a
child, whatever she must endure to produce one.
Sufficiently hard, Darnley pushes up Mary’s gown and begins
to forcibly take her from behind. Mary winces. It’s painful.
It’s degrading. But she knows it will be over soon.
And it is - in less than 30 seconds. Darnley grunts with his
climax, then stumbles out of the room.
On Mary, trying to hold back tears. It was awful, but she
achieved what she wanted to. She climbs onto the bed and lays
down on her back. Pulls her knees up to her chest.
A few moments later the Four Marys re-enter. They see from
Mary’s position that the deed is done.
MARY (CONT’D)
Pray for me.
The Four Marys kneel around the bed and lower their heads in
prayer. During which we begin to hear a PRIEST’S voice from
the high Latin mass...
PRIEST (V.O.)
Incensum istud a te benedictum,
ascendat ad te...
INT. HOLYROOD - CHAPEL - DAY
TIGHT on the Priest swinging an incense thurible-PRIEST
...Domine, et descendat super nos
misericordia tua...
The Latin continues as we watch the coloured light through
the stained glass windows traverse the floor in time-lapse.
CUT TO TIGHT on the thurible as it swings.
CUT TO TIGHT through a clear pane in the window, we watch a
flower bloom in time-lapse.
CUT TO Darnley kneeling before the altar as the Priest
conducts the mass.

65.

PRIEST (CONT’D)
Accendat in nobis Dominus ignem sui
amoris, et flamma aeternae
caritatis. Amen.
DARNLEY
Amen.
The Priest hands the thurible to an ALTAR BOY. Turns to
Darnley.
PRIEST
Shall I wait for her Majesty before
I celebrate communion?
Darnley looks behind him. The rest of the chapel is empty.
Abruptly he stands up and heads for the exit.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
Tight on Mary’s face as we hear Darnley pounding on the door.
From outside we hear-DARNLEY (O.S.)
We must speak, Mary.
The pounding does not stop. We PULL BACK to see her laying on
the bed beneath the covers. Rizzio is sitting by her side,
holding her hand. She’s trying to ignore the pounding but it
won’t stop. She turns to Rizzio-MARY
Let him in.
Rizzio goes the door. Undoes the bolt and opens it. Darnley
is surprised to see him.
DARNLEY
What are you...?
MARY
Come, Henry.
He brushes past Rizzio and goes to the bed. Rizzio and the
ladies exit.
DARNLEY
You would have David here and bar
your husband?
Mary closes her eyes. She doesn’t want to be dealing with
this. Darnley goes over to the seat where Rizzio was sitting.
A gentler tack, with a much softer tone.

66.

DARNLEY (CONT’D)
I was at mass. I wished you at my
side.
MARY
You shouldn’t be attending Catholic
service. It insults our Lords.
DARNLEY
When I am annointed they will
afford me the same respect as you.
Mary does not respond. Darnley gets anxious.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
You promised.
She still stays nothing. He pulls back the covers and places
his hand on her stomach. She’s clearly showing - now five
months pregnant.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Would you have his father be
nothing but a consort?
MARY
We know not if it’s a he.
Darnley cannot check his temper any longer-DARNLEY
I am more than a sire to a mare.
MARY
Please, I am tired...
DARNLEY
Do you love me?
Mary doesn’t respond.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Do you love me?
MARY
You are a Stuart. That matters more
than love.
We see fury in his eyes. But he needs her, so he has to
dampen his rage.
DARNLEY
Yes, you are tired and know not
what you say.

67.

INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
Darnley sits at the head table, an empty seat next to him,
dejected. The other guests are talking amongst themselves.
Then a hush. Heads swiveling. Everyone stands and turns to
the main door.
Mary’s ladies stand behind her. She looks resplendent. A warm
smile, her face glowing with forthcoming motherhood. Her
dress is equally stunning. There is no effort to hide the
bump in her belly.
As she makes her way to the head table the guests murmur to
each other, presumably about her pregnancy.
She takes her place at Darnley’s side but remains standing to
address the guests. With infectious charm-MARY
If you have wondered where your
Queen was these past few months,
now there are no secrets. The
whisperings can end. Spring comes
bearing fruit.
Laughter and applause among the guests.
MARY (CONT’D)
My husband and I give thanks.
She takes Darnley’s hand and smiles. He forces a smile in
return. This is all for show.
MARY (CONT’D)
With heaven’s blessing we bring
another Stuart into this world,
heir to Scotland...and to England.
The addition of “England” is provocative. People begin to
applaud, although some are too jolted to do so.
We pop to Randolph, who turns to Maitland with shock.
MAITLAND
She speaks for herself.
RANDOLPH
Do her councilors fail to advise
her?
MAITLAND
We advise her endlessly, sir. Not
that she heeds us.
RANDOLPH
You must do better.

68.

MAITLAND
Better than your own Queen’s
council?
Maitland has a point. More reflectively-RANDOLPH
How did the world come to this?
MAITLAND
Wise men servicing the whims of
women?
RANDOLPH
Aye...
They look back toward Mary as the applause dies down.
Darnley helps Mary into her chair, almost as if he’s a
servant. He glances to his father, Lennox.
EXT. HAMPTON COURT - STABLES - DAY
Elizabeth stares at a mare on the ground, a newborn foal
laying beside her. A STABLE HAND is stroking the foal.
STABLE HAND
He’ll make a fine stallion.
ELIZABETH
May I?
STABLE HAND
Of course, Madam.
Elizabeth kneels down and pets the foal. It attempts to lift
its head but is still weak. A smile on Elizabeth’s face.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - STABLES - DAY
Cecil and Elizabeth walking.
CECIL
It is a clear provocation. She knew
well Lord Randolph would report.
ELIZABETH
What would you have us do? Go to
war over some reckless words?
CECIL
Not us - her brother. He hopes to
raise a second army. If we assist
him...

69.

ELIZABETH
(firmly)
As we did his first?
CECIL
(gingerly)
I shall not fail you twice.
Which is the closest he comes to an apology. She does not
reply. Then calmly, but insistent-CECIL (CONT’D)
Madam, we cannot let her name your
successor. She has no right.
ELIZABETH
When I am dead and she is dead and
you are dead, it matters not what
names we said or did not say. The
world will decide for itself.
Cecil looks puzzled and disturbed. He cannot decipher her
meaning, but he doesn’t like the tone of it-CECIL
Now is not the time to soften...
But Elizabeth is distracted by the sound of braying. She
stops to look at the mare and the foal in the distance with
the Stable Hand. The foal is already on its feet, if wobbly.
ELIZABETH
It’s a fine day, isn’t it?
She tilts her face to the sun. Cecil is perplexed. She begins
to walk toward the mare and foal.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I shall see you inside.
Cecil watches her go for a few moments, perplexed, then turns
and walks toward the palace.
Elizabeth nears the horses, then stops, watching the foal
suckle from its mother. She squints from the sun and raises a
hand to shield her eyes. Notices her own shadow. Looks down
at it. Turns so that the shadow is in profile. Lowers her
arms and pulls the front hem of her dress so that the shadow
shows a bulge where her stomach is. Considers this silhouette
for a moment, then drops the dress.
She smooths the fabric flat.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary is in a basin, receiving a bath. She is wearing a
bathing gown in the water, as is custom.

97

70.

The Four Marys attend to her, wiping her neck and arms with
damp cloths. Her belly rises just above the waterline like a
dome.
LIVINGSTON
Vous lui donnerez quel prénom, si
c’est une fille?
(What will you name her, if it’s a
girl?)
BEATON
Elizabeth.
The women laugh.
MARY
Margaret, I think - after my
grandmother. To remind her that she
is as much Tudor as Stuart.
(beat)
She is also Henry’s grandmother.
FLEMING
Will you name it after him, if it’s
a boy?
MARY
I think not. He shares the same
name as Elizabeth’s father.
LIVINGSTON
Vous lui donnerez peut-être le
prénom de votre propre père?
(Perhaps you name him after your
own.)
MARY
(trying it out)
James...
She lets the name echo in her head. She likes it. Then-MARY (CONT’D)
Oh - Look...he likes it too...
The women look at the dome of her belly poking above the
water. There are small ripples across the surface from the
baby kicking. All five women stare in fascination.
PRELAP: The sound of HOOVES as we go TIGHT on the ripples.
INT. CARLISLE, ENGLAND - INN - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
The room is small and cramped. A cot, a simple desk and chair
and no more. Moray, only in his shirt, looks out a window at
something below, although we’re on him instead of what he
sees.

71.

He proceeds to put on his doublet to make himself more
presentable as we hear footfalls coming up rickety stairs. A
knock at the door. Moray opens it a crack to verify who it
is, then lets the visitor enter. It’s a man in a hooded
cloak. He pulls out a chair for the man, who removes his
hood, revealing Lennox.
LENNOX
Elizabeth could not do better?
Moray ignores the slight. Sits down on the edge of the cot.
Lennox sits across.
LENNOX (CONT’D)
We too know what it is to be
exiled.
MORAY
(straight to business)
Your letter said you had a
proposal.
LENNOX
Have you burned it, as I asked?
Moray reaches over to the desk and picks up a small plate
covered with ashes-MORAY
Once Mary bears a child...
Dumps into the ground at Lennox’s feet.
MORAY (CONT’D)
There is no need for your son.
As Lennox brushes some of the stray ash off his stockings-LENNOX
An infant cannot grant you pardon.
LENNOX (CONT’D)
It is right that you should return
from exile. And it is right that my
son should be King.
Lennox looks back up - meets Moray’s eye with frosty
shrewdness-LENNOX (CONT’D)
As King he would do what is
right...
INT. HOLYROOD - DARNLEY’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Maitland and Lennox address Darnley, who is staring into his
fireplace at the flames, drinking from a goblet.

72.

MAITLAND
David Rizzio. He is a liability to
your rightful place as King.
Darnley fetches a carafe to refill his goblet.
LENNOX
Enough. These are serious matters.
Darnley sets down the goblet, turns to Maitland.
DARNLEY
Is it Bothwell who spreads these
rumours?
LENNOX
Your sins are well known in court.
You have done little to hide them.
DARNLEY
I have...when I drink...I do not
know what I do...
MAITLAND
(pivoting, gingerly)
Let us not dwell on that. We speak
of Rizzio’s relations with your
wife.
DARNLEY
With Mary...? You are mistaken.
MAITLAND
Does he not spend more time with
the Queen than your grace? Why else
would she make a common minstrel
her private secretary?
DARNLEY
It cannot be.
LENNOX
(impatient)
What matter if it be true?
DARNLEY
I am not a cuckold.
LENNOX
Would you rather the honest truth
be told? That you are a sodomite?
Darnley pales at the accusation. Lennox goes in for the kill,
his impatience giving force to his voice-LENNOX (CONT’D)
We must erase your sins, and either
you are the adulterer or it is she.

72A.

Maitland picks up a quill and holds it out to Darnley.
MAITLAND
The other Lords have signed.
Darnley takes the quill and dips it in the inkwell, then
bends over a parchment on the writing desk.

73.

INT. HOLYROOD - BACK STAIRWELL - NIGHT
The Conspirators head single file up the spiral stairs to the
Queen’s Chamber, Darnley and Lennox amongst them. Lennox
looks sure of himself. Darnley looks hesitant.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary, Rizzio, Seton and Fleming are playing cards in the
small dining closet attached to the main room.
TIGHT on the table as Rizzio lays down a jack of clubs.
Mary lays down a king on top of Rizzio’s jack. Takes the
trump with a smile. Rizzio shakes his head, smiling too-RIZZIO
You’ve been saving that...
MARY
(teasing)
It’s the only good card I-But she’s interrupted by the sound of a door bursting open in
the main chamber, followed by the sound of boots.
Before she can even rise, Conspirators are pouring into the
room. Maitland spies Rizzio in the dining cabinet.
MAITLAND
(to Rizzio)
Come with me, sir.
Mary is standing now. Steps in front of Rizzio as Darnley and
Lennox appear in the doorway.
DARNLEY
Stand aside.
MARY
You dare charge into my chamber
unannounced and-LENNOX
(to two Lords)
Now.
And the two Lords lunge with daggers, attempting to reach
around Mary to stab Rizzio. The women scream. Mary is shocked
at the sight of the weapons.
MARY
I am with child...
Lennox grabs Mary and pushes her toward Darnley.

74.

LENNOX
(to Darnley)
Take her.
Darnley seems stunned himself, but pulls her out of the room.
Maitland, trying to set her at ease-MAITLAND
(to Mary)
All that is done is the King’s own
deed and action.
He glances at Darnley as he says this. Mary glares at him.
The King? Darnley is pale and shaking. This is more than he
can take.
Fleming is horrified that her lover has anything to do with
this. Moving toward Maitland-FLEMING
William - what are you-MAITLAND
Do not interfere.
Two Conspirators make their way toward Rizzio. Fleming tries
to get in the way of them, but Maitland grabs her by the
wrist and yanks her aside. She falls to the ground.
Rizzio cowers, begging for mercy, but the Conspirators yank
him out of the room. As he’s being dragged across the chamber
Mary rushes forward-MARY
No...
But one of the Conspirators holds a pistol up to her, cocked
at her belly, where her unborn child lies.
Then she hears a moan. Looks over to see the melee by the
main door. Conspirators stabbing Rizzio relentlessly.
The Conspirators step aside, revealing a bloodied Rizzio on
the ground, his near lifeless eyes still open, labored
breaths coming from his riddled chest. He looks to Mary. She
wants to go to him, but still has the pistol pointed at her.
MAITLAND
(to Darnley)
You must make the final blow.
Darnley is overcome with fear himself, and sickened by the
bloody body before him. But he manages to pull out his dagger
and take a few steps toward Rizzio before stopping.
LENNOX
Go on.

75.

DARNLEY
I can’t...
Lennox has no more patience for his son’s timidity. He grabs
Darnley by the wrist and drags him over to Rizzio, then
drives Darnley’s knife-laden hand into Rizzio to deal the
final blow. Darnley lets go of the dagger, horrified. It
remains in Rizzio’s chest.
On Mary now, breaks into sobs as she sinks to her knees.
EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
Bothwell gallops away from Edinburgh - alone on his horse, no
accompaniment - fleeing for his life. He glances back as he
rides, making sure he’s not being followed.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBERS - DAY
Silence except for a swishing sound...
Mary and Darnley sit on opposite sides of the room, still
both in shock. Mary’s tears are gone, but her eyes are still
red, and she’s made still by an oppressive numbness.
We CUT TO the source of the swishing sound. Kate is scrubbing
the floor where Rizzio’s corpse was. A Guard is standing near
her, keeping his eyes on Mary.
Kate finishes. Wipes her brow, and exits with the scrub brush
and bucket.
Back on Darnley, who glances over at Mary. She seems to be
staring beyond the walls into a bleak and uncertain future.
DARNLEY
He beguiled us both, Mary. He
brought us both dishonour.
MARY
You are trying to usurp my crown.
Maitland, hearing the hot exchange from the adjacent chamber,
looks inside to see what’s happening.
DARNLEY
(to Mary, pointing)
Have I not brought you a child?
As much for Maitland’s benefit as Darnley’s-MARY
One minute makes not a man. Nor do
your stupors, which made you more
woman than a man.

76.

This stings Darnley to the core. He stands, mustering all the
authority he can.
DARNLEY
Beg forgiveness. For your insult.
MARY
I shall not.
During which an Attendant enters, whispers to Maitland.
Maitland turns to Darnley.
MAITLAND
(approaching Darnley)
Bothwell has escaped.
Darnley turns to him, processing. Mary takes note. Darnley
turns back to Mary, his fury rising-DARNLEY
This is your fault. This chaos. You
swore obedience to me on the day of
our marriage.
MARY
You are a traitor.
(to Maitland)
As are you.
(back to Darnley)
And until I am killed, and forever
after, God will see you as such.
MAITLAND
You will not be killed, Madam.
(to Darnley)
Let us go. We have much business.
Lord Moray will arrive soon.
MARY
My brother conspired...?
MAITLAND
Your brother returns to assist your
husband.
It’s a blow for Mary - the depth of the treachery.
DARNLEY
I want a drink. Where is the...
He looks around for a bottle of something. Heads into the
small dining closet. So as not to be heard-MARY
(to Maitland)
Am I to be imprisoned here alone?
(MORE)

77.

MARY (CONT'D)
Or may I have the company of my
gentlewomen?
MAITLAND
You may not, Madam.
MARY
Then at least let my husband
remain. Or would you have a
drunkard for a King?
A beat. Then Maitland exits, closing the door behind himself.
Upon hearing the door close, Darnley re-enters the main
bedroom. Seeing Maitland gone-MARY (CONT’D)
Come Henry. I do not feel well.
She gets up from the chair, then sways, seeming off-balance.
Darnley heads over to lend her an arm.
MARY (CONT’D)
Will you forgive my harsh words?
DARNLEY
If you will forgive mine.
MARY
Help me into bed...
She takes his arm as they head to the bed.

EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
Moray enters the gate on horseback flanked by two armed
GUARDS. Maitland hurriedly approaches as he dismounts. They
exchange a few words. Moray walks with brisk urgency toward
the entrance, Maitland close behind.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
Moray and Maitland enter to find Mary on the bed, clutching
her stomach, moaning in pain. Darnley is beside her, with the
four Marys and Kate.
MORAY
She feigns.
Mary looks over at Moray - surprised to see him...
MARY
Brother...

78.

KATE
We will need to undress her.
MORAY
Come. All of you. She is fine.
KATE
If we do not attend to her now, we
may lose the child.
MORAY
(to Darnley)
She feigns.
MARY
(to Moray)
Please...
Mary grips Darnley’s arm, gritting her teeth in pain.
MARY (CONT’D)
It is your son.
DARNLEY
(to Kate and Seton)
Do what you must.
(to Moray)
Out.
MORAY
Sir...
DARNLEY
Out I say.
Moray reluctantly exits.
SETON
(to Darnley)
Your grace...
DARNLEY
Yes...of course...
And Darnley exits too. As soon as the door is shut, Mary sits
up, completely fine. Moray was right. She feigned. In
whispers to the women-MARY
Who else have they killed?
BEATON
No one. Lord Bothwell has fled.
FLEMING
(distraught)
Madam - had I known...

79.

MARY
It is done.
FLEMING
He said nothing and I am sick with
hate. I shall never forgive him or
have anything to do with him again.
MARY
Compose yourself. We must be strong
now.
Fleming nods. Mary gets up and retrieves a gold, jewelencrusted cross from her personal altar. Heads to the desk
and retrieves a letter opener.
MARY (CONT’D)
(to Fleming)
Let them hear me. As I was.
Fleming begins to moan as Mary was. Meanwhile Mary starts to
pry the sapphire loose with the opener.

EXT. HOLYROOD – EVENING
Seton scurries across the courtyard and approaches the Guard
standing sentry at the gate.
MAITLAND MAN 1
You may not pass, Madam.
Seton removes a sealed parchment from the folds of her dress
and holds it out for the Guard.
SETON
Lord Bothwell.
Seton slips her fingers into her pocket and pulls out the
sapphire from the cross. Places it in the Guard’s hand. He
marvels at it. Seton then gives him the letter.

80.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary and Darnley in bed. She is in her night clothes now,
looking spent. Darnley still has his arms wrapped around her.
They talk quietly, with their eyes closed, like lovers.
DARNLEY
Are you hungry?
MARY
Not yet.
He grips her tighter, pulling her close. He runs a palm
across her belly. A pause. Then-DARNLEY
They forced me to. I didn’t know not until they arrived. And I was
drunk. I believed them. I knew not
what I did...
She knows it’s an utter lie, but she offers compassion-MARY
Maitland is very persuasive.
DARNLEY
Yes...
MARY
My brother even more so. You must
be careful of them both.
A beat as she lets this settle in, Then-MARY (CONT’D)
They will take your crown as well
as mine.
She lets this sink in for him. Then-MARY (CONT’D)
We should leave here.
Darnley doesn’t answer. Mary presses, gingerly.
MARY (CONT’D)
It’s best. For all three of us.
She places her hand on the one he has on her belly.
INT. HOLYROOD - HALLWAY - DAY
Darnley with Maitland, Moray and Lennox.
MORAY
Not before she signs the pardons.

81.

MAITLAND
We are drawing up the papers now.
DARNLEY
We will not wait on secretaries.
MAITLAND
It’s important that the people do
not accuse those who participated
as traitors. They must be pardoned
so there is no doubt of their
loyalty to the crown.
MORAY
When she signs, then you may go.
DARNLEY
Am I to be told what I may and may
not do?
(defiant)
Who are these that give me orders?
(to Maitland)
A mere Lord?
(to Moray)
A bastard half-brother?
(to them both)
Am I not the King to whom you
promised fealty before you carried
out your violence? This King shall
go where he pleases with his wife
when it pleases him. Bring the
papers to us at Linlithgow. And do
not mistake your place again.
And Darnley exits. Moray and Maitland exchange an exasperated
glance.

INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The Council is assembled. Among them Cecil and Dudley.
Silence. They wait patiently for Elizabeth. It feels as
though they have been there for a long while. Eventually
Dudley stands up--

82.

INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
Two Ladies hold up Elizabeth’s finished quilling design.
Elizabeth examines it, Bess at her side. Elizabeth is not
pleased with it. She points to a corner where we see an
interplay of leaves and flowers.
ELIZABETH
The flowers are all of one colour.
BESS
(puzzled)
Poppies are red. I know of no other
colour that they-ELIZABETH
In the light they are many colours.
Red and others. Nature is more
subtle...and confusing...
From Bess’s expression we can tell she has no idea what
Elizabeth is talking about.
A knock. They all turn. The door opens, revealing Dudley.
DUDLEY
The council is met. News from
Scotland.
ELIZABETH
What do you think?
She points to the quilling.
DUDLEY
Lovely.
ELIZABETH
Are the flowers not too plain?
DUDLEY
The news is urgent...
ELIZABETH
(to Dudley, fierce)
What news do I want from Scotland?
Bloodshed? Go conspire among
yourselves.
Dudley is surprised and shaken by the outburst, but he knows
Elizabeth well enough not to press her.
DUDLEY
Very well.
He exits. Elizabeth turns back to Bess and her Ladies, who
are as surprised as Dudley was. Regarding the quilling--

83.

ELIZABETH
Burn it. I shall begin again.
The Ladies stand motionless. Not sure if she means it.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Burn it I say.
They take the quilling to the fireplace and lay it within the
flames. TIGHT on the carefully constructed flowers charring
and uncurling from the heat.
INT. LINLITHGOW PALACE – DAY
Mary, Darnley and their small entourage approach the castle.
INT. LINLITHGOW PALACE - EVENING
Mary and Darnley enter. We see scores of soldiers. Darnley
was not expecting this and we can read it on his face. As the
two enter, a command is given and the soldiers all turn to
stand at attention. Darnley sees Bothwell, fully armored.
Turns to Mary...
DARNLEY
(to Mary)
Was this you...?
By now Bothwell has approached with two Guards.
BOTHWELL
(to Darnley)
Your chambers are ready.
Darnley looks back at Mary.
MARY
Do not make them use force.
Darnley’s shocked by the betrayal.
INT. HOLYROOD - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Moray, Maitland, Knox and Lennox are met.
MAITLAND
They have at least five hundred.
More are on the way.
LENNOX
Then we shall raise our own army.

84.

MORAY
(fatigued)
There is no appetite for war.
KNOX
So let us stir an appetite.
MORAY
When last we raised an army it was
still but half of hers with
England’s help. Without England we
will be crushed.
Moray’s pessimism surprises them all.
MORAY (CONT’D)
She has outmanoeuvred us. Now we
parlay.
INT. LINLITHGOW PALACE – HALLWAY - DAY
Moray and Maitland are being escorted down the hall to the
Receiving Room by Bothwell and several Guards.
INT. LINLITHGOW PALACE - RECEIVING ROOM - DAY
A very pregnant Mary looks over a document. Bothwell to the
side. Maitland and Moray glance at each other anxiously as
she finishes reading, looks up-MARY
My husband claims he knew nothing
of your plot until the day itself.
MORAY
That is not true. He signed a bond.
With his own hand.
MAITLAND
If you wish it destroyed,
however...
MARY
Not destroyed.
(holds up the document)
We shall sign this pardon as soon
as you produce the bond.
Maitland looks to Moray. Moray nods. This can be done.
MAITLAND
Aye, Madam.

85.

EXT. LINLITHGOW PALACE - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Mary and Moray walk side by side. There are SOLDIERS camped
outside the palace.
MARY
You visited mother and me here,
before we left for France. Do you
remember?
MORAY
Yes. Those were...tumultuous
times...
MARY
Here, in this field - you lifted me
high when I said I wished to be a
bird.
MORAY
(awkward chuckle)
If you say so...
MARY
I understand why you wouldn’t
remember a trifling thing like
that. Of what consequence are the
fancies of a little girl.
MORAY
Not all little girls are born to be
Queens.
MARY
I should like you to hold my child
up one day, and make him fly as you
made me.
She looks to him. He isn’t sure what to say.
MARY (CONT’D)
He will be born a Prince. And one
day King. I want him to love his
uncle and to be born into a
peaceful land.
MORAY
I wish the same.
MARY
Then will you love your sister as
you would love her child?
He does not answer.

86.

MARY (CONT’D)
For she still loves you, and if it
is a son, she will call him James,
for both his grandfather and his
uncle.
Moray turns, overcome with emotion - a rare event for him.
Mary touches his arm.
MARY (CONT’D)
James...
He turns back to her, swallowing his tears, clenching his jaw
to prevent himself from weeping.
MORAY
I do not deserve your kindness.
She is as moved hearing it, as he is saying it. She takes his
hand and kisses it.

87.

EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
WRITING THE LETTER HERSELF Mary rides in the back of a
covered wagon with the Four Marys, too pregnant to ride on
her own. A few soldiers accompany the wagon. She looks out
onto landscape, taking in the stark beauty of her Kingdom.
She seems secure - sure of herself - far more so than when
she first arrived in Scotland. During which--

88.

MARY (V.O.)
My dearest cousin - we have had our
differences and what sorrow it has
brought my heart. But before I
bring a child into this world...
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - DAY
TIGHT on a flat blade quilling a strip of paper for a halffinished flower. Unlike before, the flowers are a blend of
several coloured papers, giving them a shaded look-MARY (V.O.)
...I wish to reconcile. I would our
child have two mothers...
The hand with the blade suddenly pauses at this, frozen halfcurl.
MARY (V.O.)
...a mother who bears him...
We PULL BACK to see it is Elizabeth, listening as Bess reads
the letter to her - although it is still Mary’s voice we
hear.
MARY (V.O.)
...and you, his chosen Godmother...
Elizabeth is visibly moved by this. She sets the blade down.
MARY (V.O.)
No child would be more blessed.
INT. HOLYROOD - SIDE CHAMBER - DAY
Mary squats as she is in labor, as children were birthed in
her time. Her hair is matted with sweat, her face flushed
from pain. Kate and the Four Marys are at her side.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
I am told the labor was long, but
only with suffering do we know joy.
What greater joy than to have ...a
son to call your own. Humbly do I
accept your invitation to be his
Godmother, that I might share in
your happiness...
As the bloody infant James is brought forth with one final,
painful push from Mary-ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...What is more, we should return
the issue of inheritance now that a
new generation is upon us...

89.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEENS CHAMBER - DAY
James - wiped clean, fast asleep - is being swaddled.
MARY (V.O.)
Your terms are most agreeable, and
delight us greatly. It is only
right that your heirs succeed you
if you marry...
The exhausted but smiling Mary on her bed as the swaddled
baby is placed into her arms for the first time.
MARY (V.O.)
...and bear children of your own.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - STABLES - DAY
Elizabeth rides in a circle around the corral, holding the
reins of a second horse - the foal (now a pony) - training it
to be comfortable with a bridle.
MARY (V.O.)
...And should you not, it is my
son’s great honor to rule by your
sublime example.
TIME CUT TO Elizabeth helping to remove the bridle and then
petting the horse for having done well.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
We must meet him soon, that we
might kiss him and show him our
love. And so that both his mothers
might meet, who for too long have
not.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary is seated in the corner, breast-feeding her infant, a
warm, glowing maternal smile on her face as she looks down at
the suckling child. The Four Marys are present.
A knock at the door. Fleming heads to answer the door as
Seton retrieves a linen shawl to cover Mary’s breast as the
child continues to feed.
Once covered, Mary nods to Fleming, who opens the door,
revealing Darnley and Bothwell. Darnley looks meek, and the
worse for wear.

89A.

DARNLEY
(re the child)
May I...?
MARY
Come.
Darnley goes over. Bothwell averts his eyes so as not to see
the Queen in undress.
Darnley looks down on the child. Attempts to stroke his
cheek. But as soon as he does, the child begins to cry.
MARY (CONT’D)
Shhhh.
But the child keeps crying. Beaton comes over. Mary hands the
child off to her. Beaton rocks the child back and forth as
Mary pulls the shawl over herself.
DARNLEY
(a weak smile)
Strong lungs.
Mary, calm and direct-MARY
We have procured a house for you.
Bothwell will see you there.
A beat - Darnley comprehends the implication of her words.
DARNLEY
You imprison me?
Mary points to a document on her desk.
MARY
Is this not your name?
Darnley goes over to it. Looks down. He’s caught, momentarily
frozen. But the inveterate liar that he is, he retorts with-DARNLEY
It is forged.
MARY
Henry...
DARNLEY
I swear.
MARY
It is your hand.

89B.

DARNLEY
They must have - they must have
plied me with wine. They tricked me
into it. Those scheming devils...
MARY
Stop...
DARNLEY
Or that heretic Knox - possessed me
with some demon that took hold of
my spirit...
BOTHWELL
He is mad...
DARNLEY
(lashing out at Bothwell)
Am I? Am I mad? Yes then, I am mad.
(to Mary)
For I would never with my own free
will-As he approaches her, desperate-DARNLEY (CONT’D)
...You must believe me.
But Bothwell steps in between and grabs his arm.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Let go, you brute.
But Bothwell does not. He looks to Mary again, almost
childlike-DARNLEY (CONT’D)
Please...Am I not to see my own
son? Is he not to know his
father...?
MARY
(calmly)
For your child’s sake, be contented
with a pardon and your life.
(glances at the child)
You may say good-bye.
Beaton brings the child over to Darnley. Darnley tries to
touch the child’s face again, but it only wails louder. The
possibility that this may be the last time he ever sees James
gets to Darnley. He begins to weep. To Mary-DARNLEY
Forgive me...for the love of God...
MARY
Go now.

89C.

DARNLEY
My darling...
She takes the child from Beaton. As she begins to rock him,
he stops crying.
DARNLEY (CONT’D)
I beg you...
MARY
(to Bothwell)
Take him.
Bothwell approaches Darnley and takes his arm. But he won’t
be man-handled again. He wrests his arm away, and with the
last bit of dignity he can muster, he exits on his own,
Bothwell following.
On Mary - rocking the child in her arms as she watches
Darnley and Bothwell exit.
INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Mary’s assembled Council - including Moray, Maitland and
Bothwell - stand when she enters.
TIME CUT to everyone seating, mid-conversation-MAITLAND
You must divorce him, Madam.
MARY
It is forbidden.
MAITLAND
Not by the Church of Scotland.

90.

MARY
He is the father of my child. I
will not do him such an indignity.
BOTHWELL
He threatens flight to England.
Should he raise an army there-MARY
Elizabeth would not welcome him.
She is not so foolish as to choose
a degenerate over her sister.
INT. ELIZABETH’S COUNCIL - DAY
Elizabeth’s council similarly gathered.
CECIL
If you grant her succession then we
are rewarding her disobedience.
ELIZABETH
What disobedience? She is not our
subject.
RANDOLPH
And yet you would make us hers.
ELIZABETH
(with heat)
What have you produced in all your
travels between our kingdoms?
Discord. War. Death. And now you
have the boldness to doubt my
judgment? You had better question
yours.
Randolph, chin high, trying to maintain as much dignity as
possible-RANDOLPH
I regret that you perceive me as a
failure.
CECIL
(stepping in)
We serve you fully, with all our
hearts. Any one of us would gladly
die for you. But Mary is our foe,
and a Catholic. Is it not within
our rights to ask that we never bow
to her as we bow before you?
ELIZABETH
She is only your Queen if I should
not produce an heir.

90A.

CECIL
And will you, Madam? For you have
given us little hope so far.
INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
MAITLAND
Darnley is cursed. We who have
wronged you on his behalf seek only
to prevent more wrong.
MARY
He is harmless.
BOTHWELL
Not so. When I delivered him to his
lodgings he screamed things most
profane, and spoke of regicide.

91.

MARY
You have commanded armies against
armies. Now you fear a single man?
BOTHWELL
I did not claim to fear him.
MARY
Then why advocate divorce?
BOTHWELL
My oath is to defend your safety.
MARY
So you do fear him.
BOTHWELL
No, I...what I meant...
Bothwell grasps for words. Rhetoric is not a strength.
MARY
Just as you vowed to protect me, I
vowed loyalty to my husband however regrettable that vow may
be. I owe him neither comfort nor
title, but I will not become a lady
Henry Eighth, dispensing with
husbands as he did wives.
INT. ELIZABETH’S COUNCIL -DAY
ELIZABETH
Despite your every effort she has
prevailed. She has proven herself,
in fact, far more capable than my
own Privy Council.
(sardonically)
Should I die before my time, we
could do worse than to place her on
the throne of England.
INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
MARY
...I have brought peace to our
land, produced an heir to my throne
and arranged succession to my
sister’s. Our strength is secure.
Her command of the room is total. Then, with a softer tone-MARY (CONT’D)
Let my husband rave and threaten.
We pity his madness, and it is
punishment enough.

92.

As Mary stands, the Lords begin to stand and-INT. HOLYROOD – COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Nobles are exiting the Receiving Hall. Maitland and others
are in a small conspiratorial group. As Moray passes-MAITLAND
Sir, join us...
He ignores them and keeps walking. Maitland is surprised.
Bothwell emerges. Maitland turns his attention to Bothwell-MAITLAND (CONT’D)
My Lord, you argued well in
Council. May we borrow your wisdom
for a moment?
Bothwell is sceptical but intrigued. The circle opens to him.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER - EVENING
THREE YEAR OLD JAMES sees something in the ashes of the
fireplace and teeters towards it.
INT. PRIVATE HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

The hooded men place the barrels in the center of the cellar,
their work lit by a single lantern. One of them opens one of
the barrels and scoops a pile of dark powder into his hand.
Begins to lay a trail of the powder back toward the door.

INT. DARNLEY’S HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
At the cellar’s entrance one of the hooded figures lowers the
candle and lights the trail of powder. It begins to burn
towards the barrel as the men hastily exit.

93.

INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER - EVENING
THREE YEAR OLD JAMES plays in the ashes of the fireplace.
INT. DARNLEY’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
A half-dressed Darnley and a naked YOUNG MAN seated at a
table, both drunk. They reach for the bottle at the same
time, knocking the bottle off the table and breaking a glass.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER - EVENING
JAMES finds a DEAD BIRD in the ashes of the fire grate and
reaches towards it.
INT. DARNLEY’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
Darnley tries to pick up the glass but cuts himself in the
process. Winces in pain. Looks for a piece of cloth to wrap
his finger in.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER - EVENING
Mary hurries over to James and lifts him up and away from the
carrion. Rubs his hands clean with the hem of her dress.
INT. DARNLEY’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
Darnley is wrapping his finger with his shirt tail, trying to
stem the blood he bends down to pick up the bottle when-BOOM with a FLASH that fills the screen, an explosion rocks
the room. Darnley and the naked YOUNG MAN is hit by the brunt
of the explosion. A tapestry is blown from the wall across
the room, onto Darnley bending over on the floor.
INT. HOLYROOD - QUEENS CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary bolts up in bed, awakened from the sound. The Four Marys
are stirred awake too. James is standing in his crib, crying.

EXT/INT. DARNLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
FLAMES whooshing from the blown out window, engulfing the
house.

93A.

INT. DARNLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
DARNLEY splutters awake in the burning building. He grabs the
tapestry and, using it to cover himself, runs from the
building.
EXT. DARNLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
CUT TO the Hooded figures, watching this from afar.
CUT TO their POV and we see Darnley, stumbling from the
house. Wrapped in the smoking tapestry.
CUT TO the Hooded Men walking briskly toward him.
One of the Hooded Men bends down and, using the cord of the
smoking tapestry throttles Darnley. His eyes bulge in fear as
the life is choked out of him.
INT. HOLYROOD - BANQUET HALL/RECEIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Mary is sitting at one of the tables, cradling James, who is
fast asleep. The Four Marys are with her. There are half a
dozen Guards in the room.
Bothwell enters. He sits down across from her. Gently--

94.

BOTHWELL
It was Lord Darnley.
Off Mary’s puzzled look-BOTHWELL (CONT’D)
An attempt on his life.
MARY
Is he dead?
Bothwell gives her a sympathetic look which confirms this.
Mary breaks into sobs. James wakes up, troubled by his
mother’s tears. Seton comes over and takes the child from
her, who has begun to cry himself.
BOTHWELL
I’ll bring you to my estates. It’s
not safe for you here.
EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
The sky gray with pre-dawn light. Mary’s final few trunks are
being loaded onto a wagon. Mary is kneeling before James,
holding his hands to help him stand. Seton awaits on a horse.
Bothwell is with them. She’s saying good-bye, and it’s hard.
MARY
Will you be good?
The child stares blankly at her.
She lifts the child up to Seton. The child looks as though he
might cry. Mary takes his foot and shakes it. His would-be
tears morph into giggles.
MARY (CONT’D)
Yes - you’ll be good.
And she tenderly kisses his foot. Then nods to Seton, trying
to remain strong in her farewell. Seton begins to trot out of
the gate, accompanied by two SOLDIERS on horseback.
Mary watches them go for a moment, in an impenetrable daze,
lost in her thoughts, oblivious to all else. Bothwell places
a hand on her shoulder. Then leads her toward her own horse
and the wagon where the three other Marys are already seated,
cloaks on, ready for the journey.
EXT. DUNBAR CASTLE - EVENING
Mary, Bothwell and the Royal Entourage approach the castle a gloomy, militaristic seaside edifice.

95.

INT. DUNBAR CASTLE - GUEST CHAMBER - NIGHT
Mary is being undressed by her ladies. They have only removed
her outer sleeves when the door opens, revealing Bothwell. He
turns away so as not to see her unsleeved arms.
BOTHWELL
Pardon...
The ladies move to re-attach her sleeves but Mary declines-MARY
No need.
BOTHWELL
May we speak in private?
She nods to the Marys. They file out past Bothwell, still
turned from her as he shuts the door behind them.
MARY
You may look. ‘Tis only my arms.
He turns to her. He looks nervous. It’s unlike him.
BOTHWELL
I know it is smaller than your
lodgings in Edinburgh, but I hope
it will suffice.
MARY
What brings you?
Bothwell hesitates, then finding his confidence, launches in-BOTHWELL
The Parliament will ratify a
proclamation demanding you wed a
Scottish subject now that you are
widowed.
MARY
It has only been a day...
BOTHWELL
They meet tomorrow. It is your
council’s advice that you should
marry me.
And now she’s beginning to connect the dots-MARY
My God...What have you done?
Bothwell simply stares at her.

96.

MARY (CONT’D)
No.
BOTHWELL
Madam...
MARY
Leave me. Now.
BOTHWELL
Madam...calm yourself...
He moves toward her. She skirts around him and heads for the
door, but he grabs her by the wrist. He pushes her onto the
bed and holds her down.
MARY
Murderer.
BOTHWELL
Did I not come to your aid when
your Lords rebelled?
Mary resists.
BOTHWELL (CONT’D)
Refuse and I will not come to your
aid when they rebel again.
MARY
Please...
He lets go. She sits up, overcome with sobs. Bothwell goes to
the door and opens it. To the three Marys in the hall-BOTHWELL
Come.
They enter, bewildered and concerned to see Mary in tears.
BOTHWELL (CONT’D)
Undress your lady.
They look to Mary. She is wiping her tears away now.
TIME CUT TO-Bothwell grunting over her. Perfunctory. Mary expressionless,
trying to block out what is happening.
A POP to the three Marys outside the draped bed, fighting
back their own tears as they hear Bothwell within, forcing
himself upon their mistress.

97.

EXT. SCOTTISH CHURCH - DAY
Knox stands before his congregation as we saw him earlier in
the film. But now the room is doubly packed, people spilling
outside and lining the walls. And far more COMMONERS than we
saw the first time. Knox is really worked up.
KNOX
The Queen is servant of Satan. She
is a fornicator. A whore of Bablyon
who defies the sanctity of
marriage. What’s worse, she has
broken the most solemn of
commandments: Thou Shalt Not
Kill...
We CUT TO the face of the commoners, rapt by the sermon, a
bubbling anger in their eyes.
KNOX (CONT’D)
She had her husband killed so she
could wed his rival. Would we
worship a murderous harlot? Would
we kneel before a polecat who
bedded an Italian? An agent of
Rome? David Rizzio was slain for
such adultery, and now Queen
Strumpet marries another man whom
she bedded out of wedlock. How do
we know her son is not a bastard?
Our Kingdom has become a disgrace to God and all the world...
COMMONER
(yelling out)
Death to the whore!
The crowd, whipped into a fervor, yells in approval. Others
start chanting “Death to the whore!” We hear their yells and
chants continue as-INT. DUNBAR CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
Mary and Bothwell at the altar of the chapel, the Bishop
presiding. Maitland and Moray are in attendance.
TIME CUT TO Bothwell placing the rings on Mary’s hand. They
kneel and the Bishop blesses them both, then begins to pray.
This may be INTERCUT with the scene 154, adding a layer of
the priests chanting in the wedding portion.

98.

EXT. HOLYROOD - DAY
KATE scrubs graffiti off the walls of Holyrood.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - QUEEN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Elizabeth and Dudley on her bed, the drapes drawn for
privacy. They are clothed. Her head is in his lap as he
strokes her hair. It’s very quiet and intimate.

ELIZABETH
Are we to do nothing as my sister
is deposed?
DUDLEY
She is not your sister. Nor can she
be your successor. Not a woman
whose own subjects call her a
harlot.
ELIZABETH
This is Cecil speaking...
DUDLEY
I speak for myself. Though all your
council agrees.
ELIZABETH
(more to herself than him)
How cruel men are.
DUDLEY
What was that?
She does not respond.
INT. DUNBAR CASTLE - DINING HALL - DAY
Maitland and Moray sit across a table from Mary and Bothwell.
There is no food. Only the bare table top and the solemnity
of the conversation. Moray hates every moment of this.
Bothwell is furious. To Maitland and Moray.
BOTHWELL
You promised that I would be King.

99.

MAITLAND
(coolly)
If your betrothed does abdicate,
you are abdicated also.
BOTHWELL
This was your intention...
MORAY
Events have overtaken all
intentions.
BOTHWELL
Liar! Events. Aye. Events by your
design. Is that not so?
They do not answer.
BOTHWELL (CONT’D)
Speak...Be men and own your
treachery. Did you not deceive me?
While Bothwell is shocked, Mary is not. Looking Moray
straight in the eye.
MARY
As they have done their Queen since
the day she returned.
Moray, ashamed, looks down at his hands.
MARY (CONT’D)
(to Bothwell)
Were you fool enough to trust these
men? Who took up arms against you?
Bothwell looks tortured, having been played.
MAITLAND
You must abdicate, Madam.
She turns back to Maitland.
MAITLAND (CONT’D)
When your son comes of age, he will
assume the throne.
(nodding to Moray)
Until then my Lord will be Regent.
MARY
(to Moray)
Brother?
MORAY
We found Mistress Seton. The boy is
now in our custody at Holyrood.

99A.

MARY
You hold my son prisoner?
MORAY
Not prisoner. He is my ward, until
he is old enough to-MARY
Your namesake, James. Named for
you.
MORAY
I beg your forgiveness.
(beat)
But if you wish him to be King one
day, you must abdicate.
MARY
I will not do it.

100.

MAITLAND
You will, Madam. By force if we
must.
MARY
Then I shall meet force with force.
Maitland has reached the end of his patience.
MAITLAND
The people believe you are a
traitor and a whore. What army can
defeat an entire nation turned
against its Queen? They would
sooner parade your head on a pike
than bow before a harlot. I for one
would gladly hold high the pike.
Mary is shocked by his blood-lust. Looks to Moray-MORAY
(matter-of-factly)
He is right. You cannot raise an
army.
MARY
(defiant)
Many times you have said I cannot
do what I have done.
MAITLAND
Then we are finished here.
Maitland gets up and heads for the door. Moray remains
seated. Maitland turns back, waiting for him. Moray, with
true supplication, not wanting further conflict-MORAY
This is beyond my control. I ask
you to reconsider.
MARY
All I have done is try to unify
this land.
A glimmer of hope on Moray’s face. Is she bending? But Mary
only allows her self-doubt to linger for a moment.
MARY (CONT’D)
To relinquish the crown would be
against God’s will.
MORAY
God will not protect you. But I
will protect you as my kin.
More lamentable than defiant--

101.

MARY
I wish that we were kin. But we are
no longer so.
Moray nods, disappointed. He understands and cannot fault
her. He stands and makes his way towards the door.
Bothwell moves his hand on top of Mary’s. She pulls hers
away. She cannot be comforted, certainly not by him.
EXT. DUNBAR CASTLE - DUSK
Mary is with the three remaining Marys at the cliff’s edge
overlooking the ocean. She and Fleming are at the fore,
Livingston and Beaton several yards behind. The waves are
crashing below. In French-MARY
Si vous souhaitez fuir, vous et les
autres, vous devriez le faire
immédiatement. (If you and the
others wish to flee, you should do
so.)
FLEMING
Notre obligation est à vous. Nous
n’en avons pas à nous-mêmes.
(Our duty is to you, not
ourselves.)
MARY
Vous avez assez fait. Vous ne me
devez pas vos vies.
(You have done enough. You do not
owe me your lives.)
FLEMING
Vous ne devriez pas non plus
risquer la vôtre.
(Nor should you risk yours.)
MARY
Je n’ai pas le choix.
(I have no choice.)
FLEMING
Mais certes vous avez le choix.
(Of course you do.)
(gesturing to the ocean)
Regardez. La France est si proche,
nous pourrions presque la toucher.
(France is so close we could almost
touch it.)
MARY
(glancing back)
Prenez Livingston avec vous.
(MORE)

102.

MARY (CONT'D)
Elle s’est toujours sentie dépaysée
ici. Et Beaton languirait si elle
se trouvait toute seule.
(Take Livingston. She has never
felt at home here. And Beaton would
not fare well on her own.)
FLEMING
Mais Madame ...
(But Madam...)
MARY
Faites ce que je vous dis.
(Do as I say.)
FLEMING
Les soeurs de se délaissent pas.
(Sisters do not abandon sisters.)
MARY
Une reine n’a pas de soeurs. Elle
n’a que son pays.
(A Queen has no sisters. She has
only her country.)
FLEMING
Un pays qui vous a délaissée.
(Which has turned on you.)
And now Fleming gestures to the land instead of the ocean-FLEMING (CONT’D)
Vous risquez tout pour ce pays
maudit et execrable?
(You would risk everything for this
wretched land and its wretched
people?)
MARY
I would.
FLEMING
Le jeu n’en vaut pas la chandelle.
(It is not worth it.)
MARY
Je ne m’attends pas à votre
compréhension. Il n’y a qu’une
autre reine qui puisse comprendre.
(I do not expect you to understand.
Only another Queen could.)
FLEMING
Elle vous a pourtant délaissée,
elle aussi.
(She too has turned on you.)

103.

MARY
Et elle pourrait faire pire encore.
Mais je ne vais pas m’enfuir.
(And may do worse yet. But I will
not flee her.)
Now Mary turns her back on the sea to gaze on the land-MARY (CONT’D)
Ma vie est ici maintenant.
(My life is here now.)
We begin to hear the sound of BAGPIPES-EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
James - five years old now - is running forward, much more
able on his feet than when we saw him last. He’s darting
toward something he sees on the cobblestones. Seton is
following him at a leisurely pace several yards behind.
James arrives at his destination and crouches down - it’s a
musket ball wedged between two cobblestones. He picks it up
and stares at it, fascinated. He starts to lick the musket
ball. Seton scurries forward.
SETON
No.
She takes the musket ball out of his hand.
JAMES
Francais?
SETON
Balle.
He sees another one. Runs over and picks it up. Then another.
Picks that one up too. Seton follows.
As he rounds the corner he sees a PLATOON of troops
mustering. A QUARTERMASTER is handing out musket balls to
troops from a bucket, which they are placing in pouches. A
PIPER plays during all of this.
Seton comes up alongside James, who is staring at the troops
with as much fascination as he did the musket ball.
SETON (CONT’D)
Soldat.
JAMES
Soldat.
SETON
Soldiers.

104.

JAMES
What is soldiers?
SETON
They fight.
JAMES
Fight what?
SETON
(with some sadness)
Ta mere.
James looks up at Seton, not fully understanding.
PRELAP: the SOUND of a MASSIVE BATTLE - screams, yells, the
clanking and clashing of arms, then CUT TO-INT. SCOTTISH CHURCH - DAY
KNOX stands before congregation. We see images of Mary and
Moray preparing for battle.
KNOX
Oh Lord, hear our prayer, that we
may rid this land of this HarlotQueen and her murderer-husband.
INT. SMALL PRIVATE CHAPEL - DAY
MARY alone at prayer. Bothwell, unnoticed is behind her. He
watches her and leaves.
INT. LARGE CHURCH - DAY
MORAY at prayer with his soldiers on the eve of battle. It is
a huge and well-armed force.
KNOX V.O
Hear our prayer for those men, who
do as God commands them to do...
...not that which seems good in
their own eyes.
YOUNG JAMES I has crept into the church and is watching Moray
through the soldiers’ legs.
KNOX V.O
Our prayers will be heard. But
those Catholic traitors who fight
with her, speak into the void.

104A.

EXT. LANGSIDE - FIELD - DAY
VERY TIGHT on HECTOR - THE HIGHLANDER - the one who Mary
spoke to. His entire face fills the screen. We see nothing
else. It is streaked with mud and caked blood. He is on his
back. Fallen.
We can hear the battle surrounding him on all sides,
CLAMORING and FIERCE, but see NOTHING of it, only his face.
He gurgles fresh blood from his mouth. The sound of the
battle starts to FADE as we push into his eyes, replaced only
by the sound of his strained breathing.
As we push CLOSER we hear his voice, in SCOTTISH GAELIC,
struggling to recite “Hail Mary”-HECTOR
Fàilte dhut a Mhoire, tha thu lan
de na gràsan...
We CUT TO his POV - straight up. Nothing but the sky fills
the frame-HECTOR (V.O.)
Tha an Tighearna maille riut.
Is beannaichte thu am measg nam
mnà...
CUT TO VERY TIGHT on MARY’S EYES - filled with horror watching the battle from afar. Only her EYES fill the frame,
slowly pulling out to see the despair on her face-HECTOR (V.O.)
...agus beannaichte toradh do
bhronn, Iosa.
A Naoimh Mhoire, Mhathair Dhè,
guidh air ar son ne na peacaich...

105.

CUT BACK TO the SKY, as it fades to BLACK-...a nis, agus aig uair ar bàis.
And just before it reaches total black, we hear hear the
last, shallow breath of the Hector.
EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
A CONTINUATION of Scene 161. On James looking at the gate as
Moray enters on horseback, flanked by two CALVARYMEN also on
horseback. He is muddy from the battle. Sees the troops
mustering. All activity stops and they stand at attention as
he slowly rides in. To a CAPTAIN overseeing the QuartermasterMORAY
Dismiss them.
The Captain stares at him blankly. In anger, mixed with his
own shame and fatigue-MORAY (CONT’D)
Dismiss them! It is done.
There’s nothing euphoric about this victory. The Captain
immediately forms the troops to march out of the courtyard.
During which Moray sees James and Seton. He dismounts and
approaches the child as he takes his gloves off. Seton looks
concerned.
JAMES
(in French)
Where is maman?
He crouches down to eye-level with James. Places his hand
over the child’s heart.
MORAY
She is here.
(beat)
And you will make her proud...
Then he lifts the child up - and holding him so he’s now at
the eye-level of a grown man-MORAY (CONT’D)
...for one day you will be King.
And all this will be yours.
SETON
(to Moray)
Does she live?

106.

EXT. SOLWAY FIRTH - DAY
Pre-dawn light. The FISHERMAN preparing a rowboat for the
journey across. Two of Mary’s ESCORTS are with her. As the
Fisherman sets to unfurling the sail, Mary gazes out across
the water at a thin ribbon of land on the horizon-MARY
England does not look so different
from Scotland.
FISHERMAN
Aye, they are sisters.
She stares into the distance a moment longer, then heads over
to the rowboat. The Fisherman and the Escorts help her board.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - SITTING ROOM - DAY
TIGHT on Elizabeth, trying on a wig - bright red. Looking
into a hand mirror that Bess is holding up for her.
ELIZABETH
Let us try the other.
One of her Ladies removes the current wig as Bess retrieves
the second one and helps Elizabeth put it on. Then holds the
mirror up to her again. Elizabeth takes the mirror herself so
she can see it from all angles.
CECIL (O.S.)
Madam.
Elizabeth tilts the mirror and in it sees Cecil in the
doorway. As Cecil steps into the room so he can face her-CECIL (CONT’D)
If anyone were to learn of such a
meeting - whether it be the
Scottish Lords or our own here in-ELIZABETH
I agree that secrecy is vital.
Alas, you have a skill for keeping
such things hidden. So put your
skills to use.
CECIL
Is it guilt, Madam?
Elizabeth turns to him, offended. He has struck a nerve.

107.

CECIL (CONT’D)
Because a monarch should never feel
guilt.
ELIZABETH
(sharply)
My motive is not your concern. Do
as I say and make the arrangements.
Cecil is smart enough not to challenge the rebuke. He bows in
submission and exits. Elizabeth picks up the mirror and
inspects the wig once more.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
This one I think.
EXT. FOREST COTTAGE - DAY
A small cottage in a clearing surrounded by woods. The
Attache is out front, keeping guard. He hears dogs barking in
the distance.
INT. FOREST COTTAGE - DAY
Mary is at a small window, looking out.
ATTACHE
Away from the window, Madam.
Mary steps away from the window and the Attache shutters it.
A moment later Bess enters. Eyes Mary for a moment, then
turns to the attache.
BESS
I rode ahead. She’ll be here soon.
On Mary, full of anticipation at hearing this. Then Bess
whispers something into the attache’s ear. He turns to Mary-ATTACHE
Come.
He leads her to the rear, hidden by washing hanging from the
rafters, out of sight from the front of the room.
ATTACHE (CONT’D)
Remain here.
EXT. FOREST COTTAGE - DAY
The CAPTAIN helps Elizabeth off her horse. So as to be heard
by the rest in the hunting party--

107A.

ELIZABETH
I should like some privacy whilst I
rest.
CAPTAIN
Of course, Madam.
Elizabeth makes her way toward the cottage alone.

108.

INT. FOREST COTTAGE - DAY
Elizabeth enters. Looks around the main room and sees Bess
and the Attache. He bows.
ATTACHE
Your Majesty.
They silently retreat to another portion of the cottage,
leaving Elizabeth alone. She does not move.
BACK TO Mary, leaning forward, tempted to get up and meet
her, but remaining where she is as instructed.
BACK TO Elizabeth, her heart is pounding too. She takes
several steps forward.
CUT TO Mary as footfalls draw near, floorboards creaking.
Then they stop.
Mary listens for a moment, still, should she say something?
CUT BACK TO Elizabeth, frozen. She is building the courage to
confront Mary.
BACK TO Mary-MARY
Cousin...?
And we INTERCUT between the two, in separate spaces, hearing
but not seeing each other.
ELIZABETH
(barely audible)
Aye...
Elizabeth swallows her anxiety and steadies herself. Louder-ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Are you well?
Mary desperately wants to go to her but holds back. She
doesn’t want to do anything to offend Elizabeth.
MARY
Your voice is not what I expected.
ELIZABETH
What did you expect of it?
MARY
I do not know.

109.

ELIZABETH
Vous préférez que nous nous
parlions en français?
(Would you rather we speak French?)
MARY
We are in your country. I shall
speak your language.
She waits for Elizabeth to respond, but she does not. Mary
takes a step closer.
MARY (CONT’D)
How I long to see your face.
But she stops short of revealing herself.
ELIZABETH
No one can know we meet.
MARY
Yes, I have been instructed.
ELIZABETH
If you speak of it to anyone, I
shall deny. And I will regard your
words as treason.
MARY
Am I your subject now?
ELIZABETH
(softer)
No - you are not my subject.
(beat)
But you seek refuge.
MARY
(swallowing pride)
I am grateful for your protection.
They are so close, but still cannot see each other.
MARY (CONT’D)
How did it come to this?
Elizabeth does not have an answer.

110.

MARY (CONT’D)
May I see you, sister?
Elizabeth is frozen. Mary waits, but with no response, steps
into the same space as Elizabeth. As she does Elizabeth
turns, so her back is to Mary. Elizabeth brings her fingers
to the side of her wig, making sure there are no underlaying
locks out of place.
ELIZABETH
My eyes are weary from travel.
Mary gazes at Elizabeth’s back.
MARY
I should have stayed true to your
love. I should have followed your
example and never married.
ELIZABETH
But then you would have no son.
MARY
Whom I have not seen these past two
years. Whose mother is without a
crown. Whose own throne is usurped
by his uncle.
Elizabeth still has her back to Mary-ELIZABETH
You must have faith your brother
will keep his word.
MARY
I have no faith in him.
(beat)
I have only faith in you.
On Elizabeth, closing her eyes. She can guess what is to come
next, and it is a difficult matter. Mary takes a few steps
closer to her-MARY (CONT’D)
You would let them show the world
that a Queen can so easily be
forsworn?
No answer from Elizabeth.
MARY (CONT’D)
Answer me, sister.

111.

ELIZABETH
To war with Scotland and betray my
own clergy on a Catholic’s behalf no. I cannot. You know I cannot.
MARY
Did you come so far at such great
risk only to refuse me?
ELIZABETH
I came because...
But she decides not to finish the sentence. Mary waits, then-MARY
If you refuse me, say it to my
face. Do not force to me beg to
your back.
Elizabeth turns and they take each other in for the first
time. We see pride and humility on both their faces, anger
and love, compassion and antagonism - a kaleidoscope of
contradictions. Then, eventually-MARY (CONT’D)
I will kneel before you if I must.
ELIZABETH
It would make no difference. You
are safe here in England. But that
is all I can offer.
Mary cannot contain her emotion any longer, her frustration
and anger and sorrow and despair rise up.
MARY
I have been abandoned by so many. I
am utterly alone.
ELIZABETH
As am I. Alone.
MARY
Then be my sister. Be my boy’s
Godmother. Together we could
conquer all of those who doubt us.
Do not play into their hands. Our
enmity is precisely what they hope
for. I know your heart has more
within it than the men who counsel
you.
ELIZABETH
I am more man than woman now. The
throne has made me so.
(beat)

112.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
But I have no enmity with you.
MARY
Except to seed rebellion and
deceive me time and time again.
ELIZABETH
You would do well to watch your
words.
MARY
I will not be scolded by my
inferior.
Elizabeth is stunned by the comment.
ELIZABETH
Your inferior...
MARY
I am a Stuart, which gives me
greater claim to England than you
possess.
Elizabeth brings a hand to her wig-ELIZABETH
I had this made because I wanted to
present the best version of myself.
She takes off the wig and stares at it as-ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I was jealous. Your beauty. Your
bravery. Your motherhood...
She looks up at Mary-ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
You seemed to surpass me in every
way.
(a beat, then coldly)
But now I see there was no cause
for envy. Your gifts are your
downfall.
She tosses the wig onto the dining table. Mary is shaken, but
tries to maintain her dignity. Chin held high.

113.

MARY
What now, sister?
ELIZABETH
You will still have my protection.
On my terms.
MARY
Until you have me killed.
ELIZABETH
I will do no such thing.
MARY
Wouldn’t you? As Henry killed your
mother?
ELIZABETH
I am not my father.
MARY
His blood is your blood.
ELIZABETH
As long as you do not provoke my
enemies, you have nothing to fear.
Your fate is in your own hands.
MARY
If I seek to help your enemies, tis
only because you pushed me to their
arms. And should you murder me,
remember that you murder your
sister...and you murder your Queen.
That is the final straw. Elizabeth goes to the door leading
to the kitchen and opens it. Both Bess and the Attache stand.
As Elizabeth goes to the door Bess glances over at Mary, who
glares back at her, defiant.
EXT. FOREST COTTAGE - DAY
As Elizabeth approaches the hunting party, she forces a smile
for show. Everyone starts to mount their horses. Elizabeth,
in hushed tones to the CAPTAIN as he lifts her to her saddle-ELIZABETH
Take her somewhere you can guard
her well.

114.

EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
TIGHT on a hand reaching into a small bucket of musket balls,
grabbing one and placing it into another’s hand. We PULL BACK
to see it has been given by a SCOTTISH COLONEL to a YOUNG
MAN, only 20-years old. The Young Man places the ball into
the barrel of the musket, then pushes it down with a rod.
He lifts the musket to his shoulder and takes aim at a straw
target placed on the other side of the courtyard. Pulls the
trigger and fires the weapon, hitting his mark.
COLONEL
Very good.
YOUNG MAN
Another.
As the Colonel retrieves another musket ball, an ATTENDANT
approaches with a folded parchment.
ATTENDANT
Sir...
The Young Man looks over.
ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
A letter, from England.
EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
Alone, the Young Man reads the letter, the expanse of the
valley below.
We hear Elizabeth’s voice, much older and deeper now-ELIZABETH (V.0.)
My dear cousin, I write to you of
your mother, whose care you have
entrusted to us these many years...
And now we realise that the young man is James.
We REPRISE PORTIONS OF THE FOOTAGE from the beginning of the
film - where we only see Mary from behind - but now with
Elizabeth’s letter overlaid.
INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - DAY
She is on her knees in prayer, joined by her CHAMBERMAIDS,
facing the door.

115.

ELIZABETH (V.O.)
With an extreme dolor that
overwhelms my mind for that
miserable incident which has
befallen...
The heavy door pivots open, revealing Andrews. He bows his
head, then, with solemnity and respect-ANDREWS
It’s time.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - HALLWAY - DAY
Elizabeth walks toward us, looking the age we saw her last.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
I tell you that while I mourn, I
feel no guilt, for I am innocent...
Elizabeth rounds the corner and we see her appear on the
other side, she is 10 years older - more make-up, a brighter
wig, her dress more regal-ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...A Prince cannot be guilty for
what is just. What other answer to
such plots against my throne...
A double set of doors are opened for her and as we see her
pass through she is another 5 years older, more gaunt, her
dress even more elaborate and severe-ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...than to respond to treason with
the punishment that it demands. How
it ages me to bear such a burden...
Another set of double doors. And this time as she passes
through we see her finally at age 54, the year of Mary’s
execution. She almost looks inhuman - thick make up hiding
wrinkles, a fiery wig, massive collar and ornate dress. She
has entered the Privy Council Chamber--ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...the figurehead of justice that
would take away a mother you
remember not...
EXT. HOLYROOD - COURTYARD - DAY
On James, tears welling in his eyes as he looks out over the
valley...

116.

ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...Know that when I see her in my
mind’s eye, I see not an aged
woman...
INT. HAMPTON COURT - PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
As an aged Cecil places a document before Elizabeth - the
warrant for Mary’s execution - she stares directly at us,
stoic, an old woman lost in a memory-ELIZABETH (V.O.)
...but rather the young,
resplendent Queen whose portrait I
first gazed upon five and twenty
years ago...
INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - CORRIDOR
Mary approaches the Great Hall as she did at the beginning,
but now we are in front of her instead of behind her, and she
is the young, resplendent Queen Elizabeth imagines-ELIZABETH
No older than when she first set
foot upon this island...
INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY
The vast room is filled with a hundred spectators. The wooden
stage. Soldiers to the side.
The crowd parts to make room for Mary and her procession as
they enter. The spectators look upon her with silent awe and
fascination as she heads directly for the stage, mounts the
steps to the platform where two MASKED MEN stand waiting for
her. One of them offers her a small stool on which to sit.
TIME CUT TO-TIGHT on Mary as The Clerk of Elizabeth’s Privy Council,
ROBERT BEALE - reads the warrant-BEALE (O.S.)
By order of our sovereign
Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales
Ireland and Overlord of Scotland,
certified...
He continues on after the word “Scotland” but his voice fades
out as Mary begins to speak, directly to the camera, in a
quiet, intimate voice.

117.

MARY
James, my only son, I pray that
with your life you will succeed
where I could not, and for which I
am about to give my life...
We CUT TO Bull - the Executioner - who bows his head in
supplication-BULL
I plead your forgiveness, Madam.
MARY
I forgive you with all my heart.
For now, I hope, you shall make an
end of all my troubles.
Bull gestures to a cushion before her in front of the block.
Mary kneels and begins to pray, head bowed, eyes closed-MARY (CONT’D)
Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ,
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra,
salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ,
In te Domino confido...
Her Latin prayer fades as it is replaced my Mary’s V.O.
MARY (V.O.)
I shall be watching you from
heaven...
Mary’s eyes open as Bull places his hand on Mary’s shoulder.
We hear the steady drone of a single bag pipe.
INT. HAMPTON COURT - RECEIVING CHAMBER - DAY
James, in full regal attire, sitting on Elizabeth’s throne,
crown atop his head, scepter in hand, staring straight into
the camera-MARY (V.O.)
As your crown, one day, unites two
Kingdoms.
A flourish of notes from the bag pipe.
INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - GREAT HALL
Bull gently guides her head to the chopping block.
We are TIGHT on her face as we see the frescoed ceiling
beyond it.

118.

She is trying to keep calm but she is breathing fast now,
pulse racing in her final few moments. The axe will fall any
second. To us, in a whisper as the pipes play-MARY
And we shall have peace.
A deep intake of air, the pipes growing even louder. A slow
exhale. The briefest flash of calm.
BLACKOUT. SILENCE.
