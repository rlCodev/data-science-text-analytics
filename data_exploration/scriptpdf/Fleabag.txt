INT. FLEABAG FLAT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.

Shot of the inside of a front door. Fleabag’s POV.
Shot of Fleabag a few steps away from the door, watching it
as if she’s ready to pounce. Smudged makeup, hair tousled.
Out of breath.
Shot of the inside of a front door. Fleabag’s POV.
Shot of Fleabag. She turns to the camera.
FLEABAG
(Earnest, touch of pain)
You know that feeling when a guy
you like sends you a text at 2
o’clock on a Tuesday night and asks
if he can ‘come and find you’ and
you accidentally make it out like
you’ve just got in yourself, so you
have to get out of bed, drink half
a bottle of wine, get in the
shower, shave everything, put on
some agent provocateur business,
suspender belt, and wait by the
door until the buzzer goes (buzzer goes)
And then you open the door to him
like you’d almost forgotten he was
coming over.
She opens the door to a handsome man.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
(casual)
Oh hi!
Hey.

GUY YOU LIKE

FLEABAG
(to the camera)
Then you get to it immediately
They start snogging violently.

INT. FLEABAG’S BEDROOM. CONT.

They are going at it on the bed. She talks to us during. In a
throw of passion he flips her over onto her side so she is
facing us, with him behind her. She frowns.
FLEABAG
Then after some pretty standard
bouncing you realise that he is
edging towards your arsehole.

FLEABAG (CONT'D)
But you’re drunk, and he made the
effort to come all the way here so,
you let him. He’s thrilled.

He looks thrilled and faintly whispers “I’m so thrilled”

INT. FLEABAG’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

3

She lies in bed. He is sat over her like a mother caring for
a child. Gazing at her. He is incredibly earnest.
FLEABAG
Then the next morning you wake to
find him sitting on the bed, fully
dressed, gazing at you. He says
thatGUY YOU LIKE
Last night was incredible.
FLEABAG
Which you think is an overstatement
- but he goes on to say / it was GUY YOU LIKE
It was particularly special because
I have never managed to actually...
up the bum with anyone before –
FLEABAG
To be fair, he does have a large
penis - and GUY YOU LIKE
Although it’s always been a fantasy
of mine, I’ve never found anyone I
could do it with.
FLEABAG
He touches your hair
(he touches her hair)
and thanks you with genuine
earnest.
GUY YOU LIKE
(intensely)
Thank you.
FLEABAG
It’s sort of moving. He kisses you
gently.
(he kisses her gently)
And then he leaves.

INT. CAFE. MORNING.
Fleabag sits with a cup of tea looking up into the distance
pensively. A moment of real consideration passes before...
FLEABAG
(to camera, with fear)
Do I have a MASSIVE arsehole?
TITLE: FLEABAG

INT. AN OFFICE. LATER.

5

Black. Sounds of panting breath. Reveal of Fleabag, out of
breath and slightly sweaty. A man sits opposite her reading a
document.
MAN
Thanks for coming in today. We
really appreciate you considering
us for your
(reading it)
small business start-up loan.
FLEABAG
No problem.
MAN
I have read your application.
Thank you.

FLEABAG

MAN
It was funny!
FLEABAG
Oh - ok - that wasn’t my intention
but...
MAN
Great. As you are probably aware we
haven’t had the opportunity to
support many - any women led
businesses since the uh FLEABAG
Sexual harassment case

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

4.

MAN
The sexual harassment case, yes.
Are you alright?
FLEABAG
Yes sorry I just ran from the
station. Bit hot. I’m really
excited about Water?

MAN

FLEABAG
No, I’m – I’ll be ok – actually,
yes please, that would be great.
He doesn’t do anything about the water.
MAN
Sure. It says here that your “cafe”
has been up and running for two
years - Traditionally we don’t
consider applications unless the
business is in its embryonic stage
but since this is a - young,
interesting... female-led business
we are willing to... double take He laughs. Fleabag laughs. He stops, confused as to why she
is laughing. It’s awkward.
MAN (CONT’D)
Yeah. There are one or two details
that need to be ironed out and a
couple more bits and pieces I’m
going to need to see. It says here
that you opened the cafe with a
partner in Fleabag pulls her top above her head. Realises she hasn’t got
a top on underneath and pulls it back down again.
MAN (CONT’D)
Ah ok. Um. (Beat) I’m sorry. That
won’t get you very far here any
more.
FLEABAG
Oh no sorry. I thought I had a top
on underneath.
MAN
Yeah ok but FLEABAG
No, in this case, genuine accident.

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

MAN
With our history I understand why
you might have thought FLEABAG
No, I wasn’t trying to - Jesus I
was hot!
MAN
I take this sort of thing very
seriously now.
FLEABAG
No I’m not trying to shag you, look
at yourself!
Beat.
MAN
Ok. Please leave.
FLEABAG
What? But, you don’t understand, I
need this loan MAN
Please just leave.
She gets up and starts to leave
Perv.
Slut.
Wow.

FLEABAG
MAN
FLEABAG

MAN
Please leave.
FLEABAG
You please leave.
MAN
It’s my office.
Yeah?
Ok.

FLEABAG
MAN

He leaves. Fleabag puts her head in her hands.

INT. BUS. LATER.

Fleabag is sitting. Bored. She grabs a paper and looks at it.
We see a gratuitous picture of a half-naked women in an
advert for mortgages. Next to it there is an article which
reads: Has the word “feminism” become dirty? She raises her
eyebrows.
She looks up and catches the eye of a man who is looking at
her over his paper. She looks at the camera and raises her
eyebrows slightly. He pulls his paper down and reveals that
he has a REALLY tiny mouth with very large front teeth. Close
up of the mouth.
Fleabag subtly looks at the camera and does an impression of
his tiny mouth. She quickly looks down. She tries not to
smile and we can see she is trying to let her eyes flick to
us in amusement.
He looks down. She looks down. They both look up at the same
time. A couple of people are noticing. Smiling too. It’s all
eyes flicking and subtle grinning. Fleabag grimaces slightly.
Bus Rodent smiles at her. She smiles back. He smiles at her
again. She smiles back again. Someone presses the button.
They both stand up at the same time. They do a little awkward
laugh at each other. They stand next to each other.
BUS RODENT
(really giggly)
Wow... so this doesn’t happen very
often does it?
FLEABAG
(really giggly)
Nooo no... I suppose it’s quite
rare.
(to the camera)
I hate myself.
Bus Rodent smiles at Fleabag awkwardly for a second then BUS RODENT
Are you going to work?
FLEABAG
Well actually I BUS RODENT
Ok. This might sound a little crazy
but I think I should take your
number and I think I should call it
and ask you to go out for a drink
with me.
Um... I -

BUS RODENT
Fuck me, you’ve got a boyfriend.
FLEABAG

Oh no I’m so sorry slash really
pleased. How the hell did he fuck
that up?
Uh...

INT. FLEABAG BEDROOM. NIGHT. FLASHBACK.

Fleabag is lying in bed with her computer in her lap and a
pizza. She takes a bite. She is working on a spread sheet.
She flicks over to her CV. She flicks over to BBC news
website. She clicks on a video of Obama giving a speech. She
goes very serious. She starts touching herself.
Suddenly a young man lurches into shot.
HARRY
What are you doing!?
She flips the laptop down quickly
Nothing.

FLEABAG

Beat. Harry gets up, opens the wardrobe, takes out a bag and
starts packing some things.
Baby..?

FLEABAG (CONT’D)

HARRY
I know what you were doing.
FLEABAG
I was watching the news!
HARRY
(genuine)
Really?
Yes!

FLEABAG

HARRY
(genuine)
Really?

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

Yes!

FLEABAG

HARRY
(vulnerable)
What was he talking about?
Beat
What?

FLEABAG

HARRY
(vulnerable)
Please. I need to hear this. What
was he talking about?
Long pause
Iraq?

FLEABAG

Hurt and furious Harry manically starts packing again.
Baby-

FLEABAG (CONT’D)

HARRY
Don’t say anything.
She doesn’t.
HARRY (CONT’D)
Please don’t stop me leaving.
She doesn’t move.
HARRY (CONT’D)
Please don’t.
Ok.
DON’T.

FLEABAG
HARRY

He pauses. Then picks up his stuff. He goes into the drawer
and empties all the condoms and her vibrator into his bag.
Wow.

FLEABAG

HARRY
I’ve really tried to be there for
you through this. You can’t say I
haven’t tried.
She nods.

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

HARRY (CONT’D)
Don’t say anything. And please
don’t contact me. Or turn up drunk
at my house in your underwear. It
won’t work this time.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
It will.
HARRY
(sadly)
I’m um... I’m taking the posh
shampoo.
(beat, angry)
He was talking about democracy.

INT. BUS. CONT.

FLEABAG
Oh he was just - he was really
supportive with my work, he’d cook
all the time, run baths, hoover,
laugh at my jokes, he was great
with my family and my friends loved
him.
(beat)
Plus he was really fucking
affectionate.
He laughs like she’s told a brilliant joke. Bus stops.
BUS RODENT
Sounds like a dickhead!
They both get off.
8A

EXT. STREET. CONT.
BUS RODENT
So um... is that a... ‘Yes, you can
have my number?’
FLEABAG
Um yes! I guess, yes. That’s a yes.
BUS RODENT
Oh my god. Great!
(gives her his phone, she
types her number in)
I’ll be sure to treat you like a
nasty little bitch.
He winks at her. She looks at us with raised eyebrows. She
hands the phone back

BUS RODENT (CONT’D)
That was a joke, by the way.
FLEABAG
Oh, I know!
She looks at us. Visibly disappointed. She looks back at him.
BUS RODENT
Wow! Ok. Cool. I’ll buzz you then.
(he jogs off, grinning)
Can’t stop smiling!

INT. STEPS. LECTURE HALL. CONT.

Fleabag runs up the stairs. There is a sign that reads:
“TODAY’S LECTURE: “WOMEN SPEAK”.
9A

INT. CORRIDOR. CONT.

9A

Fleabag enters the sparsely full corridor and walks towards a
serious, well dressed woman standing, reading a kindle.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
My sister. She’s uptight and
beautiful and probably anorexic,
but clothes look awesome on her
so...
She reaches Claire who puts her kindle away
CLAIRE
You’re almost late.
FLEABAG
I had to do a flash poo in pret.
CLAIRE
Ugh christ, did you wash your
hands?
FLEABAG
(wiping her hand on
Claire’s face)
Course not.
CLAIRE
Oh my GOD. You are DISGUSTING.
Fucking hell.
She takes a antibacterial gel out of her bag. They walk.
FLEABAG
(to the camera)
Mum died two years ago.
(MORE)

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

FLEABAG (CONT'D)
She had a double mastectomy, and
never really recovered. It was
particularly hard because she had
amazing boobs. My sister’s got
whoppers. I mean - just look at
them - But she got all of Mum’s
good bits.

11.

INT. LECTURE THEATRE. CONT.
Claire and Fleabag enter and look for seats amongst the
gradually filling lecture theatre.
CLAIRE
Heard from Dad?
No.

FLEABAG

(to camera)
Dad’s way of coping with two
motherless daughters was to buy us
tickets to feminist lectures, start
fucking our Godmother and
eventually stop calling.
(to Claire)
You look tired.
CLAIRE
Thanks. I’ve been sleeping really
well recently.
They sit. Fleabag is taking her coat off. Claire eyes her
top.
FLEABAG
Shit.
(pulls the coat back on)
I’m wearing the top that she “lost”
years ago. Shit.
CLAIRE
Do you wanna take your coat off?
Nope.
Ok.

FLEABAG
CLAIRE

Beat. Someone squeezes through the row. They’re all really
polite. They sit back down.
CLAIRE (CONT’D)
So any luck with FLEABAG
Oh GOD, can we just relax / for

CLAIRE
I WAS GOING TO ASK HOW IT WAS GOING
WITH THE CAFE?!
FLEABAG
I KNOW I JUST DON’T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT YET.
CLAIRE
FINE. WE WONT TALK THEN.
FINE.

FLEABAG

Beat.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
Hair looks nice.
Fuck off.

CLAIRE

Beat. Claire reads her kindle. Fleabag stares at her.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
The only thing harder than telling
your super-high-powered-richanorexic-super-sister you have run
out of money is having to ask her
to bail you out.
(beat she looks at Claire)
I’m just going to ask her.
(beat)
I’m just going to ask her.
(beat)
I’m just gonna asCLAIRE
Do you need to borrow money?
NO.

FLEABAG
(petulant)

(to camera)
Can’t do it. Can’t do it.
CLAIRE
So business is good then?
FLEABAG
(petulant)
Yes. Really good. Really really
good. It’s really good.
CLAIRE
Sounds like it’s really good.

Fleabag is at the counter. A man walks in.
Hey.
Hey.

FLEABAG
YOUNG MAN

He goes to sit down.
FLEABAG
Can I get you anything?
YOUNG MAN
No thanks. I’m good.
He sits down. Beat. He then plugs in his computer. Fleabag
frowns. He then plugs in his phone. He then thinks, unplugs
his phone. Plugs in a multi-plug, plugs in his phone again.
He then plugs in his kindle.
FLEABAG
Um - you sure I can’t get you
anything.
YOUNG MAN
Oh sorry. Course. I’ll have a...
tap water please.
Fleabag begrudgingly gets a guineapig shaped cup out of the
cupboard. YOUNG MAN looks at all the pictures.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
What’s with all the guinepigs?

INT. LECTURE HALL. CONT
Claire is reading.

14.

FLEABAG
(to camera)
I run a guineapig themed cafe, but
it’s out of cash and it’s going to
close unless a cheque falls out of
the sky or a banker comes on my
arse, but neither are going to
happen and I don’t want to justify
the banker man with a proper
mention so I’m not going to talk
about him or how I do sometimes
wish I could admit to not having
morals and let him come on my arse
for ten thousand pounds but
apparently we’re not supposed to do
that. So I won’t. Even though I
could.
11B

INT. CAFE. FLASHBACK. CONT.

11B

Fleabag turns to the YOUNG MAN
FLEABAG
It’s a long story... my- it’s (she hesitiates)
It’s just a theme. A quirky,
pretentious theme. Y’know. Gets the
punters in.
Shot of the cafe. Painfully empty. Man smiles gently.

INT. LECTURE THEATRE.
Fleabag is eating a sandwich. Claire is not.
CLAIRE
Is Harry helping?
FLEABAG
We broke up.
CLAIRE
What?! Again?
FLEABAG
If you see him, I’m a wreck ok.
CLAIRE
God. Just don’t get drunk and
scream through his letter box
again.
FLEABAG
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Don’t get drunk and shit in your
sink again.

CLAIRE
(flipping out)
When are you going to stop bringing
that up?
FLEABAG
When you do something better.
CLAIRE
I have two degrees, a husband and
burberry coat.
FLEABAG
You shat in a sink. Nothing is ever
going to be good enough.
Someone squeezes past. They’re really polite again. They sit.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
I swear there are pants that give
you thrush.
CLAIRE
Where are they from?
FLEABAG
(checks, then is thrown)
Dunno.
CLAIRE
(sees them)
There you go. You shouldn’t wear
such cheap materials. They don’t
let your fanny breathe.
I know.

FLEABAG

INT. CHANGING ROOMS. FLASH BACK.
Boo and Fleabag are in adjacent changing rooms. Boo is
manically trying things on. Fleabag is dressed and exiting
her cubicle. There is a deep affection between the girls.
FLEABAG
I need new sexy pants.
BOO
(in her cubicle)
I hate my body I hate my body I
hate my body. Have you found
anything? Fucking last minute
bastard trendy parties. Why do we
do it to ourselves?! I look
PREGNANT.

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

16.

She steps out of her cubicle in a badly fitted dress to find
Fleabag holding her coat.
BOO (CONT’D)
Oh god definitely not. That does
nothing for you. I hate that.
Fleabag just looks at her.
What?

BOO (CONT’D)

FLEABAG
These are my clothes, Boo. I’ve
been wearing these all day.
BOO
Oh my god. Were you wearing your
coat?
FLEABAG
Yes. But - nothing here looked good
so I thought I’d just wear what I
was wearing today.
BOO
Are you joking?
FLEABAG
Are you joking?
BOO
(unsure)
Yes...?
Beat. They chuck clothes at each other.
FLEABAG
OH MY GOD. I’VE GOT TO GET A WHOLE
NEW OUTFIT NOW WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL
ME BEFORE I’VE BEEN SO MANY PLACES
TODAY.
BOO

INT. LECTURE HALL. CONT.
Claire now eats a sandwich. Fleabag watches her.
FLEABAG
(whispers to camera)
Maybe she’s not anorexic. Maybe
clothes just - bitch.

17.

Everyone claps. Sound of a mic as the lecturer settles on
stage. She is a middle aged, confident, middle class woman.
We intercut with their reactions.
LECTURER
Gosh look at you all! Thank you so
much for coming to “Women’s Speak opening women’s mouths since 1998”.
I am overwhelmed by how many faces
I see before me! What an honour.
Now, before I begin, I want to ask
you a question. The same question
that inspired me to give this
lecture. The same question that was
posed to women all around this
country with, well frankly,
shocking results. Now, I don’t know
about you, but I need some
reassurance.
(little laugh)
So, I pose the same question to the
women in this room today: Please
raise your hands if you would trade
five years of your life for the socalled “perfect body”?
Fleabag and Claire raise their hands instinctively. Everyone
stares at them. They put their hands down guiltily.
FLEABAG
(whispering to Claire)
We are bad feminists.
CLAIRE
(slight smile)
I want my top back.
Ok.

FLEABAG

INT. STEPS. LECTURE HALL. CONT.
Fleabag hands Claire her top and ties her coat up tightly.
CLAIRE
Won’t you get cold?
FLEABAG
No, I have really hairy nipples.
Pause. Claire looks sadly at her.
What?

FLEABAG (CONT’D)

Claire suddenly tries to hug Fleabag. Fleabag flinches and
ends up whacking her head.

15

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

OW FUCK.

18.

CLAIRE

FLEABAG
What was that!
CLAIRE
What!? It was a - fucking hug.
FLEABAG
Well it was terrifying! Never do it
again. Fuck.
CLAIRE
(hurt)
I’m just trying to - I’m trying (this is not easy)
Do you want to go for a drink or FLEABAG
I have plans.
CLAIRE
(frosty again)
Ok. Fine. Sure. See you next time
Women Speak, then.
Yeah.

FLEABAG

She leaves. Fleabag watches her go. A tinge of regret for
turning her down. A woman from the lecture passes.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
Do you want to go for a drink?
No.

WOMAN
(confused)

Some time goes past. She gets a text. It reads: “BUS RODENT:
Still smiling. :)” She grimaces. And then texts back: “Oh my
god me too!.. You free tonight?”
16

INT. PUB. NIGHT.

16

Bus Rodent now sits with Fleabag. He is talking animatedly
through his tiny mouth. They both have drinks. She pushes
some crisp towards him. He eats one like a hamster. Fleabag
raises her eyes to the camera.
FLEABAG
He’s telling me thatBUS RODENT
Yah, my sister is deaf.

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

19.

FLEABAG
Which is his way of letting me know
that he is interesting and
sensitive. Which is fine.
(to Bus Rodent)
So you use sign language with her?
BUS RODENT
(genuine)
God no. I didn’t have time to learn
sign.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
Didn’t have time.
BUS RODENT
Yah, but you see we grew up
together so she can lip read me
like, really well.
FLEABAG
Really!? Wow. Lip reading is very
dependent on BUS RODENT
Yah also she’s like really into
really deep base because she can
feel the vibrations y’know The sound of his voice fades out as Fleabag imagines she is
deaf, lipreading him. All she can see is OOoooOOOOooo which
is written on the screen next to his mouth. She looks at
another punter. He is clearly saying “When was the last time
you fucked a teenager?”, which is written on the screen. She
looks at a woman with a scarf round her head clearly saying
“and I woke up and he had just shaved my whole body.. My
eyebrows and everything. See (she points), pencilled”. She
looks back at Bus Rodent who is still talking. No sound.
OOOOOooooo written on the screen.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
Poor deaf bitch.
BUS RODENT
So, I’m just going to go for a
wazz.
He goes. Fleabag nicks a twenty pound note out of his wallet.
He reappears and picks up his wallet from the table.
BUS RODENT (CONT’D)
Same again while I’m up? Or a
little cockytail? Or a shot!?
FLEABAG
Or we could just go back to mine?

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

20.

BUS RODENT
Oh! Wow thanks, but I’ve got work
tomorrow.. another drink though?
FLEABAG
I could just come back to yours?
BUS RODENT
It’s a pretty early start though soFLEABAG
I’ll could get you a cab in the
morning.
BUS RODENT
(laughing)
That’s ridiculous!
FLEABAG
What’s your problem?
BUS RODENT
Oh. Nothing. I just... I like you.
FLEABAG
(grabbing her bag)
Ok. You’re a dick.
BUS RODENT
What’s going on? IFLEABAG
You’re pathetic.
She gives a smug look to the camera as she gets up and walks
to the door. Bus Rodent follows.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
Don’t follow me. It’s too late.
BUS RODENT
I’m not- you just- dropped this.
He hands her the twenty pounds she stole from him. She takes
it and struts off towards the door.
17

EXT. BUS STOP. NIGHT.

17

There is an incredibly drunk girl sitting on the curb.
Fleabag watches her. Drunk Girl suddenly slips off and
crashes to the floor. Her bag empties over the floor, her
boob falls out of her top. Fleabag helps her back up and puts
her boob back in. They both settle. Then the whole thing
happens again. Fleabag helps her up and then sits next to her
so the girl rests her head on Fleabag’s shoulder. After a
while she looks up.

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

You ok?

21.

FLEABAG

Drunk girl nods.
DRUNK GIRL
Are you ok?
(touches Fleabag’s face)
Sad face.
I’m fine.

FLEABAG

Long pause. Then the girl looks at her intensely before
Aw.

DRUNK GIRL

(beat)
You’re such a lovely man.
Fleabag looks at the camera. A cab passes. Fleabag hails it.
FLEABAG
Do you want to - spend the night
with me?
DRUNK GIRL
WHAT?! NO WAY! Naughty boy...!
Fleabag picks the girl up and walks her to the cab.
DRUNK GIRL (CONT’D)
Hey! Bad man! I said NO!
She puts Drunk Girl into the cab, puts the stolen twenty quid
note into her hand and closes the door. She sits at the bus
stop again. A drunk man sits too close beside her on the
curb. He looks a little leery.
Alright?

GOOD MAN

They sit in silence for a while before FLEABAG
I’m not wearing a top under here.
GOOD MAN
(so lovely)
Oh no! You need me to get you
something to wear?
FLEABAG
No I - Do you want to come home
with me?

GOOD MAN
Aw, no thanks honey. I got my girl
already. Good luck with that
though. He’d be a lucky fella.
FLEABAG

Arsehole.
GOOD MAN
Isn’t London beautiful?
(smiles at her)
‘Specially when it’s shutting up
shop.
Fleabag looks at him suddenly, thrown by the words...

Boo closing the door. The girls are drunk on wine.

Another lunch break another
abortion! Another piece of cake
another two fuck it twenty
cigarettes.
(with Fleabag)
And we’re happy, so happy, to be
modern women.
They high five. Boo pulls Fleabag’s face close to hers
BOO (CONT’D)
Let’s never ask anyone for
anything. They don’t get it.
Deal.
They shake on it.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

Fleabag is swaying down a quiet street. Drunk. We stay on her
for a while. She checks her phone. Nothing. A girl calls out.
GIRL (O.C.)
HARRY! HARRY! HARRY WAIT! HARRY!
Fleabag rolls her eyes. She looks at her phone.
Fuck it.

FLEABAG

EXT. DAD’S HOUSE. FRONT DOOR.

20

Fleabag is drunk. She is ringing relentlessly on the bell.
She hammers at the door. She yells through the letter box.
FLEABAG
HHEEELLLOOOEEELLOOOELLLOOEELLOOOO!?
(to camera)
This is totally fine.
A light goes on. Eventually the door opens. It’s an exhausted
man in his fifties.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
Alright Dad!
DAD
What’s going on?
FLEABAG
Oh I’m absolutely fine!
Ok.

DAD

FLEABAG
It’s just Yeah.

DAD

FLEABAG

morning.

No I - Oh Jesus - I ok ok ok - I

He sighs.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
Ok fuck it. I have a horrible
feeling I am a greedy, perverted,
selfish, apathetic, cynical,
depraved, mannish looking woman who
can’t even call herself a feminist.
Long beat. She looks desperately at him. She needs him now.
DAD
Well...
(pathetic, trying to make
a joke)
You get all that from your mother!
She laughs a sad laugh. He tries to laugh too.
Good one!

FLEABAG

DAD
I’m - I’m going to call you a cab,
darling.
He turns to go inside. Stops, looks back at her.
DAD (CONT’D)
Don’t go upstairs.

INT. SPARE BEDROOM/ STUDIO. CONT.

21

Fleabag climbs the stairs silently. Fleabag walks into a room
where her Godmother is stood, in bizarre overralls, painting
thick black paint onto a canvas. Fleabag watches her.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
To be fair. She’s not an evil
stepmother.
(beat)
She’s just a cunt.
ALTERNATIVE LINE:
She’s just a cock.
Hi!

(to godmother)

GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
(Really lovely)
Darling! I thought that must have
been you. Everything alright?

FLEABAG
(really nice)
Yeah! Just thought I’d swing by.
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
How lovely. Lucky us.
FLEABAG
Don’t worry. Dad has already
ordered me a taxi. What you doing?
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
I’m painting. I find the night time
very... peaceful.
(she laughs)
Usually!
Fleabag laughs too.
FLEABAG
(to camera)
Oop. She’s warming up.
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
Look. I know it’s not really my
place. But - are you ok? Everyone’s
been worried abouFleabag sees a small tin sculpture of a female legs and torso
with large breasts but no arms. She strokes it.
FLEABAG
Poor fucker.
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
Yes. She’s actually an expression
of how women are subtle warriors...
strong at heart. How we don’t have
to use brute, muscular force to get
what we want. We just need to use
our Tits.

FLEABAG

GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
Innate femininity.
FLEABAG
Yeah. Tits don’t get you anywhere
these days. Trust me.
She touches the sculpture again. God Mother tries to smile
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
Yes. That’s very valuable actually.

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

How much?
Thousands.

FLEABAG
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER

FLEABAG
Can I have it?
No.

GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
(laughs)

Fleabag points to the canvas covered in black paint.
FLEABAG
Ok. What’s that?
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
That’s my self-portrait.
Oh!
Oo.

FLEABAG
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER

(wanting her to leave)
Is your father - ?
Dad’s voice weakly from the bottom of the stairs.
DAD (O.C.)
Um... It’s uh... It’s here.
Beat
FLEABAG
(a bit too loud)
THANKS.
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER
Ah. Nice of him.
She ushers Fleabag out. They kiss on each cheek.
GODMOTHER/STEPMOTHER (CONT’D)
Take care of yourself.
(she holds Fleabag’s arm)
You really do look ghastly darling.

INT. TAXI. NIGHT.
Fleabag is in a taxi riding smoothly through London.
A cafe eh?

DRIVER

Episode 1 SHOOTING SCRIPT 02.03.15

Yup.

27.

FLEABAG

DRIVER
On your own?
Kind of.

FLEABAG

DRIVER
Kind of? Go on then!
FLEABAG
It’s kind of funny actually.
DRIVER
Good! It’ll keep me going! Shoot.
FLEABAG
I opened the cafe with my friend
Boo.
Cute name.

DRIVER

FLEABAG
Yeah. She’s dead now. She
accidentally killed herself. It
wasn’t her intention but it wasn’t
a total accident. She didn’t think
she’d actually die, she just found
out her boyfriend fucked someone
else and wanted to punish him by
ending up in hospital and not
letting him visit her for a bit.
She decided to walk into a busy
cycle lane, wanting to get tangled
in a bike, break a finger maybe.
But as it turns out bikes go fast
and flip you into the road. Three
people died.
(beat, she laughs)
She was such a dick.
He doesn’t know what to say. She laughs.
FLEABAG (CONT’D)
So yeah.. Kinda on my own.
He looks at her in the rear view mirror. She drunkenly, and
sadly smiles. He drives in on silence. Her coat falls open.
She only has her bra on underneath. She pulls out the little
tin sculpture of the woman with no arms. It sits on her lap.
Two women. One real. One not. Both with their innate
femininity out. End.
