EXT. OCEAN

1

We are panning, from high, a horizon that is water, all
water, a world of water. It is softly, warmly lit.
We are starting to hear the distant thrum of engines.
Our high sweep of the planet has brought into frame the sun,
big, red, rising, just at the horizon.
The engine noise approaches, louder, and is now
distinguishable as being many engines not one.
Our continuing pan brings into frame nine B-24’s in combat
wing assembly, speeding toward us.

Phil’s head bobs with the motion of the

The copilot: HUGH CUPPERNELL. Scanning the sky for enemy
aircraft.
The top turret gunner: STANLEY PILLSBURY.
He looks out: his view to one side, of the accompanying
planes on his wing, pans forward, over his own plane’s
cockpit and nose, to the ocean before us.
A point-of-view straight down at whitecaps racing underneath
us. The view is through the hatchmarks of a sight of some
kind.
Extremely close on a blinking eye.
Close on the bombardier, LOUIE ZAMPERINI. He raises his head
from his Norden bombsight, looks forward through the belly
bubble, squints at something dead ahead.
Above him, nose gunner ROBERT MITCHELL scans the sky.

He also reacts to something dead 3

His view: a small island in the middle of the vast ocean.
He speaks into his radio:

Cup reacts, tensing after many soporific hours of flying.

MAC, the tail gunner in firing position.
CLARENCE DOUGLAS and HARRY BROOKS, waist gunners, are ready.
HARRY
You hit this one and drinks are on

Louie: His look drops back down into the bombsight.
Through the bombsight: the point-of-view starts straight
down, then tips slowly up to bring the oncoming island into
the crosshairs.
LOUIE
I ain’t goin to a bar with you
“dame magnet”. You confuse all the
broads.
There is a landing strip on the island. Planes are parked to
the side of the landing strip. However nine zeros are
suddenly moving on the runway. Taking off one by one...
PHIL
(radio voice)
Ya got it, Louie?
Louie is squinting down into the sight.
LOUIE
Get your cameras boys, I’m gonna
light it up like Christmas!
PHIL
Pilot to bombardier, your ship.
Phil flips a switch.
LOUIE
Bombardier to pilot, roger.
The sky becomes a fury of color, sound and motion.
Louie keeps his focus below.

WITHIN MOMENTS...
BANG!

Superman is rocked by a flak explosion.

The sky fills with flak puffs and the plane rocks with shock
waves.
The CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK of holes being punched into the
fuselage.
Stanley gripping his machine guns, pivots his turret as the
plane bucks. He can see nothing except white puffs of flak
bursting close by.
Louie is being bounced around, he loses the target, he tries
to find it again, staying focused.
Dull BOOM—the bomber on his wing breaks apart in its midsection and falls away trailing smoke.
Louie’s look follows the bomber as it falters, and disappear
under Superman's wing.
At last, Lou has his aim.
Louie releasing bombs. Looking down through the bay as the
bombs fall away.
A knot of planes and structures beside a runway EXPLODE.
The Superman passes over a set of red-roofed barracks and an
antiaircraft battery, Lou's second and third target. He
lines them up and watches the bombs crunch into the buildings
and battery.
LOUIE
(quietly to himself)
There you are...
Louie takes a deep breath and takes aim. He fires. The bomb
falls clear and Lou turns the valve to close the bomb bay
doors.
LOUIE (CONT’D)
Bombs away. Bombardier to pilot,
your ship.
PHIL
Pilot to bombardier, roger.

Outside there is a pulse of white light and an orb of fire:
Lou made a perfect drop… the shack was a fuel depot which
further destroys the island's phosphate.
PHIL (CONT’D)
Just like Christmas.

Superman turns toward home. Planes behind begin to follow
suit.

INT. SUPERMAN

Louie watches as a vast cloud of smoke billows upward.
When the smoke clears-- A Zero is flying aggressively right
towards the Superman. Right toward Louie.
Mitchell (above Louie) begins to fire. The Zero fires back.
Louie reacts as bullets pierce the bombardier’s bubble. He
tenses, not sure which way to lean, in the completely exposed
space. Mitchell’s bullets hit the Zero.
Louie grabs a photo taped to the now-broken glass and jams
it in his pocket. (We will later know the importance of this
picture) He grumbles as he starts crawling out of the belly:
Louie crawls out from his position into the center of the
plane.
Mac is firing at two Zeros.
Harry is firing at another.
Stanley is firing at a couple more.
Suddenly- CRACK. A bullet hole opens in the bubble just
behind his head. He turns.
A Zero is on his other side bearing in on him at 45 degrees,
guns firing.
Much firing, inside and out.
of the plane.

Bullets chink through the metal

Stanley keeps firing.
Below him, as he’s kneeling he sees Zeros through the open
bomb bay doors. More bullets pierce the plane. Bullets fly
from the plane. We see the Belly Gunner in the suspended
bubble in a fire fight with a Zero.
Bullets pierce the bubble.

5-6
Louie grabs the medical bag and climbs across the catwalk to
get to the Belly Gunner.
More gunfire. Harry fires laterally. BOOM!— a cannon round
strikes nearby and the concussion slams his head against the
wall. His goggles shatter.
He reaches up to take off the goggles. Bullets from his
target plane stitch him up. Harry’s down. (end slow motion)
Louie races toward him, pulling him away from his station to
the opposite wall.
As he stabilizes Harry and administers morphine, Louie
notices Mac at the tail gun shooting down a Zero. He also
sees Douglass-- leg shot and bloody but he stands strong and
shoots back.
Louie straps Harry down and makes his way back to the front
of the plane.
BAM!— a very big explosion— a hole rips open in the side of
the plane.

Cockpit: Phil struggles to right the plane.
Plane: Stanley recovers his target and fires.

7
Bullets streak through the Superman from every direction.
Sea and sky are now visible throughout the plane-- gashes
everywhere. Bullets fly. Each moment the holes multiply.
Louie looks up.
Stanley, in the top bubble, looks intently out, hands tensed
on guns, ready for a target to appear. One of his legs is
shredded.
He keeps shooting, not missing a beat.
In the rectangle of exterior view a Zero enters from aft,
climbing.

8
Pillsbury bangs the high speed rotator of his turret. The
turret grunts to life, whirling Pillsbury around ninety
degrees. The Zero reaches the top of it’s arc, leveling off
and speeds directly towards Superman.
Pillsbury can see the pilot who could end his life. Pillsbury
sucks in a sharp breath and fires. He watches the tracers
skim away from his guns muzzle and punch through the cockpit
of the Zero. The windshield blows apart and the pilot pitches
forward. The Zero folds onto itself like a wounded bird.
All quiet, except for wind whistling through all the
different-sized holes punched all over our aircraft.
Suddenly, the last Zero comes up from below, the sound of gun
fire, and the Zero falters and falls. Clarence Douglas,
standing at the waist gun with his thigh, chest, and shoulder
torn open, brings it down.
Louie looks down.
Through the slit of the bay doors, not yet fully closed, the
Zero spiraling away.

through the bullet holes, cutting through the smoke.

looks up at:

He

His father, ANTHONY. He gives a reproving look and a gesture
for the boy to look forward, pay attention.
A hiss from Louie’s other side-- his mother LOUISE.
Tonio!

LOUISE

She is giving Anthony a look: don’t do that!
Anthony returns Louise’s look with one of his own: What? He
was misbehaving!
Louie looks from one to the other, then back up at the
Priest.

11
PRIEST
. . . Now these things, light and
dark, night and day, they are
separated from each other.
Louie’s eyes travel across the candles to a statue off to the
side, down to a beautiful young woman and the cross on her
neck. But below it... a hint of her cleavage. His POV then
travels down to a great pair of legs.
WHAP!—the hand re-enters to smack the boy.
His father again. An insistent gesture for the boy to look
forward, pay attention. Past his father are his two sisters,
SYLVIA and VIRGINIA, smirking at him for getting whacked— and
his older brother, PETE.
PRIEST (CONT’D)
. . . God placed them each in its
place. God did not create a battle
between them. He said, I’ve
created both of these things.
PRIEST (CONT’D)
You must live through the night,
not do battle with it, for the
night also is mine. . .
Louie looks up, his attention now held by:
The large Christ crucified, at the back of the altar.
PRIEST (CONT’D)
. . . And he sent his son Jesus—not
to do battle. Not to go to war
with the sins of man, but to
forgive them. . .
Back to Louie, now looking at the Christ with some interest.
But his head turns at the sound of the priest’s raised voice-PRIEST (CONT’D)
. . . to accept the dark, live
through the night, forgive the sin,
smile upon the sinner.
(then, softer)
“Love... thine... enemy.”
Louie stares back at the priest.

Louie is chased by Officer Collier. (Close on his legs - we

Louie running down a second alley and out the other end,
across the street, and disappearing into the bushes.
14

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS

14

Louie comes bursting out of the bushes towards the train
tracks. Past an old truck kicking up dust.
He turns the corner and looks back. He’s safe. No Officer
Collier in sight.
Louie slides into a corner near an old, defunct, small
building. His hide out. His stash. It’s very impressive.
Magazines. Jars of keys, coins, and other goods he’s
collecting. He unloads the new change from his pockets and
separates them into jars.
He closes and covers his stash.
He then takes a “milk bottle” and unwraps the rubber bands
and cloth cover and takes a drink. He digs a wooden match out
of a pocket and pulls the end of his belt out of its loop.
He bends the belt-end back to expose a striking surface stuck
to its underside, strikes the match, and lights a cigarette
with deep sucks as he tucks the belt-end back under its loop
and sits.
He looks at the billboard up near the chain link fence. (A
soap ad. A pretty blonde blue eyed American woman and son. A
sweet angel of a son.) He’s lost in thought.

12-15A

Suddenly NICKY and THE BULLIES are there.
NICKY
Look who’s here. What are you doin
wop?
LOUIE
BRUTTA BESTIA!
BULLIES
(laughs, mocking)
BRUTABRUTTABAATATATA...
NICKY
Go back to Italy. You and your
greasy wop family.
Louie swings. Nicky swerves out of the way. He punches Louie
to the ground.
Louie is defiant-- he gets up. Nicky is surprised. He punches
him again. Louie starts to get up.
NICKY (CONT’D)
Stay down you dumb dago.
Louie gets up and throws his whole body into Nicky. They
fight. The other boys jump in to pull Louie off. Louie is
swinging like mad.
Suddenly, he is pulled back. Officer Collier has caught him.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - ZAMPERINI HOME - LATE DAY

His thick hand on the back of Louie’s neck, Officer Collier
escorts Louie back home. He carries the “milk bottle”.
OFFICER COLLIER
The only reason you’re not in
reform school now is because of the
respect we have for your parents.
Everybody in town wants you put
away.

12-15B
Louise opens the door to find Louie being held by the scruff
of his neck, by a fed up Officer Collier. Pete, stands next
to her. He knows what the picture means, having seen it
before.

Sorry Louise. He was fighting
again.

waits, then continues:

Officer Collier

OFFICER COLLIER
And we found this. He...painted the
bottle. It’s liquor. God only knows
where he got it. He won’t say.
Pete translates again. Louise looks from him to Louie. She
smells the bottle. The next exchange in Italian:
LOUISE
Liquor! Toots? What did you do? Why
would you do this?
LOUIE
I don’t know.

INT. LIVING ROOM - ZAMPERINI HOME - NIGHT

Louie, as his father spanks him hard with a belt strap.
Again, Louie’s expression is stoic, taking his punishment.
ANTHONY
(In Italian)
How could you do this?! What are
you doing to this family?
What do I work for? To pay for
food, for a house! How could you do
this? (beat) They don’t want us
here anyway! And now you do this!?
You’ll kill your mother with worry.
You’ll kill her. (beat) You want
to go to jail? Do you?
Anthony stops. As an Italian father, he’s angry one second,
then he feels badly about the spanking. He loves his son but
doesn’t know how to handle him. Louie looks at him defiantly.
Louise stands in the doorway, concerned and heartbroken.

In the shadows, under the bleachers - Louie, has a hideout
here. He looks out through the planks at the track.
The school track team is out training, watched by a small
gaggle of girl fans. Pete is one of the runners.
TORRANCE GIRLS
Go, Pete! Yay, Pete! Come on!

23

19-22
Louie’s eyes follow Pete as he runs. Pete’s always the one
who gets the applause.
Louie pulls up a plank to reveal another secret stash.
Cigarettes, matches, “milk” bottles, gum. He pops open a
bottle and continues to watch the race.
And of course, no boy under bleachers doesn’t enjoy a bit of
the view up at the girls.
24

MINUTES LATER -

24

THUMP! THUMP! Boots clumping towards him. Through a gap in
the planks he sees a figure bearing down on him.
TEACHER
Someone down there? Who’s down
there?
Louie bursts out the back of the bleachers and runs like the
wind. Out onto the track, hurtling past the training team.
Pete sees him go by and lopes to a stop, astonished. He
watches Louie run out of sight.

Louie is struggling. He comes to a stop, panting.
LOUIE

PETE
What are you talkin about?
LOUIE
I can’t make a track team. I don’t
even know why you want me to...
PETE
Yes, you can.
If you can take it you can make it.

LOUIE

PETE
If you can take it you can make it.
You train and you fight harder than
those other guys. And you win. You

Louie looks at his brother. He wants to believe he can do it.
He’s scared.
LOUIE
I don’t believe.
Pete looks into his little brothers eyes.

Louie considers. He sets off running again. Pete follows
behind. Louie’s running more steadily now, finding his

Louie starts near the back of the field.
He gains, steadily.
Pete inclines his head to the man next to him, eyes still on
the race. The others pull away from Louie. He’s scowling as
he runs. Another runner just ahead of him turns and shoots
him a mocking grin.
Pete calls out.
PETE
Brutta bestia, you dumb dago!
Louie wakes up. He decides to do his thing. He starts to belt
over the course.
Pete and the Coach watch as he catches up with the rest of
the runners.
Louie piles on the pressure. He overtakes the runner who
grinned at him.
PETE (CONT’D)
Go, Louie! Go!

Louie hears him as he runs and kicks it up another gear. He
flies past the leaders. As he hits the straightaway to the
finish line, Pete and the coach straighten from the rail,
tensing, absorbed, as Louie flies toward their position at

Louie is standing in the tail of the screaming B-24. The
parachute packs are tied to the .50 cal mounts. Louie holds a

Phil sits in the sand, facing the surf, forehead pressed to
hands clasped together, his attitude devotional.
Behind him, sirens and activity from the crash-landing of one
minute ago.
Louie, wobbly, walks up and, seeing Phil’s attitude, takes a
respectful beat.
Then:
LOUIE
Now you’re praying?
A small smile:
PHIL
Busy before.
Louie drops to the sand next to him.
LOUIE
My mother does that.
PHIL
A lot of people do this.
Long beat, Louie looking at Phil, who has dropped his head
back down to his knuckles and closes his eyes. The beat of
surf.
Louie watches with interest.

Finally:

LOUIE
He say anything back?
PHIL
(good-natured, as he
starts to rise)
Uh-huh. He says my bombardier’s a
dope.

Montage: lateral, and pulling, and trailing Louie. Through
beautiful countryside. Unlike the track meets we have seen
heretofore, this run is completely peaceful. Sun through
leaves, bird calls, the regular HUFF of the runner and CLOMP
of his footfalls.

Sun strobing through the leaves.

Finally: last mile-tenth turns over. The rain forest canopy
ends at a high curve in the road, revealing an endless
expanse of sea below.
Stopwatch hit.
Cup: he slows the jeep and toots the horn to signal Louie
that the mile is up. Louie slows to a jog.
Cup looks at the stopwatch.
Louie has slowed to a panting walk. The jeep eases up to
him. Cup throws the stopwatch for Louie to read. They share a
smile.
CUP
Damn shame they cancelled the Tokyo
Olympics.
LOUIE
(smiling)
Musta heard I was commin.
Shouting off from a distance. Louie and Cup turn to see Phil,
Mac, and a jeep full of crew driving toward them. Mac
shirtless in sunglasses with a cigarette-

MAC
Wrap it up speedy. We got a
mission.
PHIL
Not a combat mission. Rescue.
. . . B-24 took off about noon
yesterday.
. . . En route to Canton, and then
Australia. Except they never made
Canton. Never heard from him after
takeoff so it’s assumed they
ditched.
CUP
That’s a lot of ocean.
PHIL
(gesturing to the men in
the back)
It is. (BEAT) They got us some new
crew.
Louie looks at the new young faces. THE ENGINEER, GLASSMAN

Bombardier’s bubble: Louie is scanning with a pair of
binoculars.
His point-of-view: like the first shot in the movie, but
rougher: panning a lot of water. The pan strobes, slows,
quickens again; becomes hypnotic.
Louie drops the binoculars, blinks his eyes, raises the
binoculars again. Into his radio:

Pilot and copilot are looking intently at gauges, adjusting.

Okay. Number one is out. Other

Louie looks out the left window.

Violent shaking.

PHIL
Gotta feather it.
CUP
Yeah, yeah. (Calling out) Hey!
Engineer. Come to the cockpit and
feather the engine.
ENGINEER appears. (We will not identify this crew member by

responsible for the crash and many deaths.)

He lifts his head, bringing us into the stadium.
Far off there’s a man speaking from a balcony-- surrounded by
guards and officers.
We are in a huge stadium.
Louie glances round, taking it all in.
The dream is realized.
The man on the balcony stands and makes a gesture ‘Sieg

Louie tries to orient himself. The impact rammed him into the
waist gun mount and wedged him under it, face down. The gun
mount pressed against his neck, and countless strands of
metal coiled around his body.
Louie sinks, fights to free himself from the tangle of wires LOUIE’S POV: As he sinks, the light of the ocean’s surface
dims. His eyes close.
Moments later they open. STILL SUBMERGED. Suddenly FOR SOME
UNKNOWN REASON, HE IS FREE OF THE WIRES THAT ENSNARED HIM.

He inflates his Mae West vest and is pulled upwards in a
stream of debris. His body ascends up to the ocean's surface.

Louie looks.

Phil, dazed, has a hold of a floating tank. He wears no Mae

above his hairline, and is washed away as water slops over

Another thunk, and the raft jostles.
Hands on gunwhales, Louie looks carefully over the edge.
Dark water. Hard to see. But a dark shape retreats just

Struck by his own stupidity, he abandons arm-waving and
scrambles to open the provision pocket on the raft. He tosses
Mac the dye and he spills it into the water below.
Phil still sleeps.
Louie comes out with the flare gun.
He fires up at the dot in the sky. Phil awakens to the sound.

Suddenly a look from Mac, reacting to:

A pilot fish dangles on the end of Louie’s line-- ten inches
of live food. Louie gets the hook out, kills the fish, takes
a bite. Then he passes it along to the others. They don’t
like it, but they need it, so they eat.
PHIL
This is how the Japs eat fish. Raw.
LOUIE
If you ask me, it’s not food til
you cook it. A little garlic. A
little oil and lemon.
When we get home, you come ‘round

PHIL
Remember the Eddie Rickenbacker
story in Life magazine? Him and his
crew ran out of fuel over the
Pacific. They were drifting in
rafts for twenty-four days.
LOUIE
And they made it, right?
PHIL
They made it. But most of them lost
their minds.

You know what you’re really going
to love? Mama’s gnocchi. Nobody
makes gnocchi like her. So light,

maybe twelve.
The others listen, absorbed by the image he conjures up.
MOVE AWAY from the raft as he speaks, his voice growing
fainter as the raft grows smaller.

The condition of the three men has drastically changed after

Their upper lips are burnt, cracked, ballooning so
dramatically that they almost obscure their nostrils. Their
bodies are slashed with open cracks, after exposure to the
elements.
The men are emaciated.

soothes their skin, washes the salt and sweat from their
pores, and slides down their throats. A sensory explosion.

62
They pull out the empty tins to collect water.
Louie and Phil: they are frantically trying to slide a pump
out of its canvas sheath.
Once the pump is clear Louie takes the sheath and rips one
seam open down most of its length.
It is now a triangular piece of canvas that dips down to its
center where the seam remains intact. It is, in effect, a
large bowl.
The men hold it open to collect rain, trying to steady
themselves and the receptacle against the tossing action of
the raft.
Phil begins to pull in the second raft.
Later - the men cleaned, hydrated and silent. Each man with
his own private thoughts.

Days later: the canvas receptacle, now dried out and two
closed water bottles knock around in it. Hard sun beats down
on it.
Moments later a small sound...and a shark appears. Louie
looks down at it.
116

EXT. RAFT, PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

Finally, the shark comes close. Louie pounces. He grabs its
tail, Phil grabs Louie and together they pull the shark out
of the water, into the raft.

63
Phil and Mac jump on it as it twists and thrashes. Louie
stabs its eye with the screwdriver until the thrashing stops.
Panting, the three men lie on the dead shark.
Moments later - Phil and Louie and Mac eat the shark’s liver.
118

EXT. RAFT, PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY - DAY #33

Burning sun. DOWN to find the rafts, the men deteriorated
further. Full beards, skeletal faces.
Louie is removing Phil’s bandage.
How is it?

PHIL

LOUIE
It stinks. But that’s the bandage,
not you.
He throws the bandage over the side.
PHIL
We beat Rickenbacker’s record. Four
days ago.
LOUIE
You keeping count?
They hear a small noise in the water and realize a shark has
been drawn to the bloody bandage.
Then, in the distance, they hear a distant plane engine. Look
up to the sky.
THEIR POV:

A moving spot in the sky.

64
Mac comes to life, seeing the plane.
Louie loads and fires a flare. Phil finds the mirror and uses
it to reflect the sun towards the plane. Louie shoots off
another flare.
The look of all three men travels straight overhead with the
plane, which makes no acknowledgment.
The plane passes, far off, and fades away.
A couple of dark shapes are rippling up. Sharks.
All three men are looking down at the shapes in the water
when we hear a change in the engine noise.
The men’s eyes rise back to the plane.
It is no longer receding: it is starting to turn. . .
banking. . . returning. . . dropping in altitude.
Louie resumes waving.
As the plane approaches it drops, lower, lower.
The men wave.
Just as we see the Red Circle, its guns start firing.
Water kicks up in a line from each gun, walking toward the
raft.
The shark-shapes wriggle, reacting.
The men bail out into the stained water.
119

EXT. UNDERWATER

Fizzing bullet-trails cut between the three men fighting to
stay submerged. The water is a confusion of murky color,
flailing limbs, the sun through the pale yellow of the raft
just above.

The bullets and firing noises stop; the muffled engine noise
is receding. Dark shapes are approaching the men in the
water.
120

EXT. RAFT, PACIFIC OCEAN

The plane flies on past.
The sharks are back, almost on the thrashing bodies of the
men. Desperately they haul themselves back into the raft.
Louie is the first to flop back onto the raft; he helps Phil
and Mac in; all panting.
They hear the plane again. It’s coming back.
Get out!
I can’t.

LOUIE
PHIL

He’s just too weak to move. Louie slides back into the water.

Louie struggles to stay under the rafts. We can see the
depression of Phil and Mac’s bodies. Neither one moves.
Bullet holes pop through the canvas, shooting beams of light
through the raft’s shadow. Bullets pierce the water
throughout the following sequence:
A shark approaching Louie is shot by a stream of bullets from
above.
Louie sees a long cord straying off the end of the raft. He
grabs it.

Louie breaching, hooking his arms over the raft. He climbs
back in just as the shark comes back for another attack.
Phil! Mac!

LOUIE

Beat. Phil speaks without moving or opening his eyes PHIL
If the Japs are this bad, we might
even win this damn war.
Mac moves. Looks round. Sees the plane has gone.
Then they hear the air hissing out of the raft. Water is
filling up the bottom. One raft left, the other is shot to
shit and already completely deflated.
Louie hunts out the patch kits. The others search out the
holes. Every time they move another hole is uncovered,
hissing out air. And all the time the sharks are circling.
Phil grabs an air pump, screws it to a valve, and starts
pumping. Bubbles push out of bullet holes. Louie works on
applying patches, using the edge of the mirror to rough up
the rubber round the hole before applying glue and patch.
Phil keeps pumping hard.
Suddenly a shark lunges up out of the water, mouth open,
right at Louie An oar sweeps past Louie’s head, striking the shark back into
the water.
It’s Mac, come back to life. He beats the sharks with fury
and power we’ve not seen in him before.
Mac goes on swinging his oar, whacking at the sharks.
Mac continues hitting the sharks away as Phil pushes the pump
against his chest, inflating the raft.
124

EXT. RAFT, PACIFIC OCEAN - LATE AFTERNOON

124

The exhausted men continue with what little energy they have
left. Mac stands ready with his oar. We can see this fight
has taken a lot out of him.

67
LOUIE
Did you see that Mac surprise
attack? Damn sharks were scared
shit. He came down on that thing
like a Goddamn dive bomber.
PHIL
Saved your skinny ass.
We see this means a great deal to Mac, though he hides it
from the other men. Louie takes over the pumping.

The sun goes down over the endless ocean. The men continue to
work into the night.

Louie is near the canvas bowl, stretched out.
Mac lies with his head on Phil’s lap, not moving. The three
are barely alive, their flesh almost transparent, their bones
visible. They speak slowly, not much energy left. Quizzing
each other to keep alive.
LOUIE

stepping away, the blindfold dangling from one hand. He goes
through the door and it is closed after him.
Louie collects himself, gets on his hands and knees, and
looks around the dim and very cramped space.

closed window in the door. Hole in the floor: latrine.
Louie squints at the dirt floor by one of his planted hands:

A small beam of morning sunlight illuminates the cell wall.
Louie lifts his face into it as if trying to escape into the

NINE MARINES BROUGHT HERE FROM MAKIN ISLAND AUGUST 18, 1942
Under it, nine names.
On Louie, looking up at it.
Footsteps approaching.
Louie’s look goes to the door.
As the footsteps pass without breaking stride, something is
tossed through the door’s window: a white, irregular shape,
the size of a baseball.
It hits the dirt floor and breaks up.
Louie quickly reaches down, gathers pieces of rice, with
panicky fingers flicks maggots away, and stuffs the food into
his mouth.

The Officer slowly, meticulously, ostentatiously, cuts his

Louie looks around to get his bearings. He is surrounded by
trees. At closer look, Japanese Soldiers in green uniforms
stare out from the jungle. No chance for escape.
The Officer says something to his plate.

Louie nods. The Officer studies him. He says something to the
Translator in Japanese. The only word Louie can understand is
“Olympic.” The men share a look. Then the Translator asks
another question.

Shouting close by: Louie braces himself as the door is flung
open and a guard screams at him, the same word, over and

Omori POW Camp sits on a man-made island in Tokyo Bay: a

slats, surrounded by six fences. Ashen and gray earth.
Louie approaches oversized wooden gates into the Omori
compound. Grim, lifeless, like the surface of the moon.
Louie and the other newly arrived POWs are lined up with the
current prisoners, emerging threadbare from their barracks,
for roll call, in front of a small office building. They
stand by a “quarantine shed” - a corrugated carport, roof
without walls, completely open to the elements. The men are
ordered to stand at attention, in Japanese, by the Guards.
A bark from a Japanese guard.
The men stiffen.

The door of the office barracks swings open.
MUTUSHIRO WATANABE aka THE BIRD: a distant figure, too far
away to distinguish his features. He is in an enlisted man’s
uniform: little cap, khaki green uniform. He steps out onto
the porch, a kendo stick clasped behind his back. He looks
slowly across the men assembled before him.
WATANABE
Good evening, old prisoners.
Welcome, new hands. This is Omori
Detention camp.
He steps slowly down off the porch.
Watanabe takes a stroll down the row of men.
Lateral tracks over him as he walks along the front row of
prisoners.
All the men are looking down, taking care not to meet
Watanabe’s eye as he passes.
Reverse lateral tracks on The Bird are from behind the
assembled men, so that his face is obscured by foreground
prisoners, or seen only in fleeting bits, as he walks along
the line.
He speaks with a strong, confident voice. He clearly is very
well educated.
THE BIRD
I am Corporal Watanabe. You are
enemies of Japan and you will be
treated accordingly.
He moves down the line to Louie.
Louie’s eyes are cast down, head lowered. But the voice and
footsteps stop, as the Bird halts, directly in front of him.
Uneasy quiet.
Louie’s point of view is of the bottom half of the man halted
before him: huge, brutish hands holding a kendo stick.
The disembodied voice:
WATANABE

Louie looks up. For the first time we get a good look at the
Bird: handsome face, cold, black stare - the cruelest eyes
Louie’s ever seen.
Close on the Bird challenging Louie. Close on Louie, not
backing down. Defiant.

head, hard, making Louie stagger. Shocked, Louie takes the
hit.
Another blow and The Bird breaks Louie’s nose.

Every prisoner goes rigid with fear. Louie looks up. The Bird
swings again, delivering another blow to Louie.

fists clenched, restraining himself from hitting back, Louie
lowers his eyes. The Bird looks triumphant. He smiles.

Louie and Tinker look on as The Scots, led by BLACKIE, unload
stolen goods from everywhere inside their clothing: long
cloth tubes down trousers and sleeves are full of sugar,
tobacco leaves, flour. They stash the plunder in secret
compartments behind wooden planks.

A British soldier, MILLER, notes Louie’s bloody bruises.

WILLIAM HARRIS a handsome young Marine, points at Louie's
face.
LOUIE (CONT’D)
Why d'you call him “the Bird”?
HARRIS

Because he listens, and if he heard
us using the names we’d like to
call him, he’d kill us.
MILLER
Apparently, he grew up wealthy,
spoiled. Wanted to be an officer.
Expected to be, too. Was denied. A
great humiliation for him, not
making the grade.

Louie sees COMMANDER FITZGERALD. He is laying down writing in
his make shift journal. A man with the confidence of the

placed beside the Running Guard.
Fitzgerald, Tinker, Harris, Miller and the POWs watch from
the side as a Guard fires his PISTOL and the race begins.
The Japanese Guard takes off. Louie runs well at first. The
POWs hopes rise. They watch as he runs. But soon he begins to
fall back.
He tries to keep up, but he is too sick, his legs too weak.
The Bird studies him. Louie falls. He fights to stand. Fists
clenched in anger.
The Japanese runner wins the race. The Guards cheer.
The Bird, eyes on Louie, doesn’t smile. He sees Louie
continue to push himself toward the finish line.
Fitzgerald, Tinker and the POWs watch in silent resignation,
almost embarrassed for Louie. The Bird sees something else.
He sees Louie’s fighting spirit. It bothers him.
Louie crosses the finish line. He lays down looking up at the
sky. Relieved. A shadow appears over him.

Later in the day. Louie and Fitzgerald are carrying two
buckets slowly across the yard. The Bird and the other Guards
are in deep discussion (in Japanese). Fitzgerald listens in
as he slowly walks past. The Bird notices. He then looks at
Louie who nods and smiles as if carrying shit is his favorite
thing in the world. The Bird just stares.

INT. BARRACKS - DAWN

Smash cut to a Japanese guard yelling.
Lead by The Bird, the Guards go through the men’s things.
They find Louie’s picture and toss it on the floor. Not what
they’re looking for. They turn over the beds and rip up the
planks.
One guard signals to The Bird. He has found something.
Harris’s maps. The Bird studies them. He glances at
Fitzgerald. His rage grows.
Harris is ripped from his bed.
GUARD
(to the POWs)
Stay where you are!
The men continue but their eyes are on Harris whose maps are
thrown down in front of him.
Louie can see the Bird approach Harris and whisper something
in his ear.

89
Then The Bird takes of his belt and pounds it into Harris.
Over and over. The floor and scattered maps stain with blood.
Louie notices KANO, a sympathetic Japanese guard, watching
with a look of concern.
Louie doesn’t know what to do. He knows to move will only

FITZGERALD

LOUIE
I don’t give a damn. Let’em shoot

FITZGERALD
That’s not how we beat the bastard.

The POWs are asleep when the GUARDS ENTER:

OMORI GUARDS

The POW’s scramble out of their bunks. Louie automatically
heads for the back of the barrack to be hidden.
The Bird enters. Everyone is at attention. He expects to see
Louie, but can’t find him. He then crosses straight down the
line until he is face to face with Louie. He stares. Louie
won’t meet his eyes.
THE BIRD
Why are you last at attention!!
I... what?

LOUIE

The Bird unbuckles and pulls off his webbed belt. The buckle
is several inches square, made of heavy brass. The Bird
grasps one end with both hands.
The Bird swings the belt backward, with the buckle on the
loose end, then whips it around himself and forward, as if
performing a hammer throw. The buckle rams into Louie's left
ear. The room spins with pain and he goes down.
Louie slowly pulls himself upright. The Bird waits for him to
steady himself. He then does something surprising and offers
him tissue paper for his wound.

91

Better?

THE BIRD

Is there compassion in this man?
THE BIRD (CONT’D)
Why do you make me hit you?
A sense of relief enters Louie’s mind just as the buckle,
whirling around from The Bird’s swinging arm, strikes his
head again, exactly where it hit before. Louie feels pain
bursting through his skull, the sound goes out and his body
going liquid. He smacks into the floor.

A blur of faces talking to him.

Slowly the images resolve. Louie is sitting in The Bird’s
office, holding onto his bruised head. The two radio men are
wearing business suits, and seem unconcerned by Louie’s
condition. The Bird sits with them, equally unconcerned.
RADIO TOKYO MAN 1 (CONT’D)
NBC Radio tell America, famous
Olympic runner Zamperini is dead.
The words sound familiar. Like the men at Kwajalien. Louie
takes in what they’re saying, but he doesn’t understand why.
He glances up at The Bird. He wants to kill him.
RADIO TOKYO MAN 2
You want to tell family you are not

The Bird sees Louie’s confusion. He wants to be helpful.

The Bird cups a hand in front of his mouth as if talking to a

At another table, a Japanese RADIO HOST in a suit and slickedback hair speaks into his own microphone. Something in his

The man at the other table now switches to English:

Louie is eating, eating like he’s never eaten before. The

Japanese people. Mostly business men but a few very elegant
beautiful professional women as well.
The Radio Tokyo Men appear, and sit down with him, all
smiles.

You were good. Very good.
They put a paper before him.

He gestures to across the room to a table of American men
sitting in the cafeteria. (It’s been a long time since we
have seen healthy Americans.) Louie can’t believe his eyes.

RADIO TOKYO MAN 1 (CONT’D)
American like you. They make
broadcasts. They live here, very
comfortable. Good food.
One of the POWs looks up and meets Louie’s eyes. He sees pure
anguish there. God knows what hell they’ve been through to
agree to this. The silent message they’re sending him is:
don’t do this.
RADIO TOKYO MAN 2
They have lovely food.
Louie feels sick.

At the thought of returning to The Bird, Louie can hardly

The Bird then addresses the prisoners.

It is necessary to have respect. No

He turns and points his stick at Louie.
THE BIRD (CONT’D)
This man must be taught respect.
All other prisoners teach him this
lesson. Each prisoner will punch
this man in his face.
Louie stares down the line: there’s 220 men out there. Then
he turns his gaze on The Bird.
FITZGERALD
Sir, we can not do that.
The Bird screams an order to the guards who hold Fitzgerald
back. The Bird screams and points. Harris is pulled out of
the line up and brought to him. The Bird raises his stick and
strikes. Fitzgerald watches in horror. Harris can’t possibly
take anymore. Fitzgerald looks at Louie.
THE BIRD
You! Punch him in the face!
Fitzgerald steps forward. Louie braces. The men understand
this is all they can do to save Harris. Fitzgerald punches
Louie.
The ENLISTED MAN comes to attention.

POW’s. Most are AUSSIES who look like stick figures. Some,
like Louie, still wear the tropical weight khakis they’d worn

Louie sees the commander and his knees buckle. Tinker must
lean against him to hold him up. Louie is at his lowest

We discover the Naoetsu Camp Commander is:

onto the icy ground.
Beside The Bird is his henchman HIROAKI KONO. Wire rim
glasses, gold teeth and a pirate smile.

The sack of coal weighs heavy on Louie. Sweat pours down his
face, streaking through the layers of soot.
The line slows.
Louie looks ahead. A POW, a few men forward is collapsing. He
drops to his knees. The weight of the coal pulls him off the

car. The ramp to the railroad car is perilous. The baskets
are heavy and make Louie top heavy, throwing off his balance.
Louie is weak, As he makes his way up the ramp, A Guard is
making his way down. As they pass each other, he pushes into
Louie, causing him to fall over the side, some five feet
down. One of Louie’s legs hits the ground before the other,
causing a tearing sensation, then scorching pain in his ankle
and knee.
Louie sees The Bird some 15 feet away looking off into the
distance. He knows these were his orders.

The sun blazes. Louie blisters in the heat, holding the
wooden beam above his head.
Tinker, Miller and the POWs watch from a distance. Helpless.
Louie is shaking. The plank is heavy.
Only hatred gives him strength.
Fitzgerald looks across at the camp clock. 3:15.
ON LOUIE - Sweating. His once athletic body now emaciated and
wounded; barely up to the task. UP TO THE BEAM - Wavering,
but not dropping.
ON THE BIRD - Smoking, smiling, watching.
POW’s are being prodded to keep working.

Minutes pass. FINALLY, SLOWLY, LOUIE LOOKS UP.
He looks at The Bird.

Fitzgerald reacts.
Close on Louie
After years under the cruel punishment of this man-- Louie
finally look directly at him. He sees him as if for the first
time. His eyes locked on the Bird’s face. The Bird meets his
stare. Defiant, Louie keeps the plank above him.
One by one the POW’s and Guards stop and stare.
218

MINUTES PASS-

218

Louie feels the sun come across his face. He feels not the
heat but the warmth. THE LIGHT. He feels his own spirit rise.
He transcends.
Louie’s face changes before our eyes. Still looking at The
Bird, he can see through the monster. The Bird can feel it.
He is taken aback. Furious. He feels exposed. Human.
We remain close on Louie and The Bird through this deep
exchange.
All the men in the camp are watching.
Close on their faces. Louie’s fight is their own. They see
his strength and their spirits rise. Even Blackie begins to
smile.
WIDE - A space round where Louie stands in the sun, the beam
above his head.
The camp clock. 3:40.
The Bird is no longer smiling. His black eyes riveted on
Louie.
LOUIE HAS BROKEN THE BIRD.
219

Minutes later- on Louie - Eyelids drooping. Shuddering.

219

Still, he holds up the plank.
Louie’s eyes go in and out of focus. He sees:
The Bird can’t take it anymore.
Angry, he jumps down off the roof and charges towards him in
a fury. The Bird reaches Louie, who is still holding up the
beam. The Bird feels beaten.

114
He rams his fist into Louie’s stomach, causing Louie to fall,
dropping the beam on top of him.
The POWs are dumbfounded.

No noise.

Long quiet.
The Bird smashes Louie with the kendo stick.
Many blows.

Louie is on the ground.

The blows continue.

Falling blows.

High shot: The Bird standing over Louie’s body, panting.
After a beat looking down at the body, The Bird seems to come
to a stop. He looks up from Louie to the crowd of Soldiers
and Guards, realizing where he is.

Prisoners to barracks. Now.
The Guards move the men.

KONO

Something is noticeably different about Kono and the Guards.
They seem shaken. Less arrogant. Anxious.
Louie, Tinker, Fitzgerald and the hundreds of POWs have been
lined up as Kono makes an announcement.
KONO (CONT’D)
Prisoners of Naoetsu. The war has
come to a point of cessation.
They POWs remain silent, suspecting a trick. A suspicious
silence hangs in the air.
KONO (CONT’D)
Today, in the spirit of a new
future for our great nations, we
invite all Prisoners to bathe in
the Hokura River.
Louie and his group see: The Armed Guards open the gates and
wait to escort the POWs to the river. The Guards use their
rifles with bayonets to usher the men along.
TINKER
(under his breath)
This is it. We’re dead.
Louie and the others believe Tinker is right. Most of the
POWs start to exit. The Guards usher Louie and his gang, who
have no choice. They are led towards the tunnel.

A few POWs hiking down to the river, break from their lines,
begin taking off their clothes and running into the water.
Louie slowly peels off his clothing, as he watches:
The Guards standing with their guns. They look menacing at
the POWs in the river. Their hands gripping their rifles.
Louie wades into the river near Tinker and Fitzgerald.
POWs scattered throughout the river are bathing as the Guards
stand on the riverbank with their rifles. But little by
little, the POWs throughout the river start to question this
“gift of the river bath”. One by one, they stop scrubbing or
bathing...touching the arm of the POW next to them, to take
notice of the Guards standing with their rifles, staring at
them in the river.
SILENCE. Louie, Fitzgerald, Tinker, Miller, Harris and the
POWs stand motionless in the river, all eyes focused on the
Guards staring at them with malevolent intent.
THEN THEY HEAR IT: Guards and POWs alike. It is the growl of
a distant aircraft engine. They all turn to the sky:
POWs see nothing at first in the overcast sky. Then, bursting
through the clouds: A TORPEDO BOMBER in the distance.
Louie stands to face the on-coming Bomber, bracing himself to
die. Tinker, Fitzgerald and Miller also brace themselves.
As the POWs and the Guards watch, the Bomber dives, levels
off, skims over the water.
Louie and the POWs can see inside the plane: the Pilot is
standing. And on each side of the fuselage, under the wings,
A BROAD WHITE STAR.
IT IS AN AMERICAN BOMBER. The plane’s red light is blinking a
message in Morse code.
Fitzgerald near Louie can read the coded message. He cries:
FITZGERALD
The war is over...It’s really over.

118
The news spreads throughout the river to every POW. Some
shout. Some break down. Some stand in disbelief.
The Japanese Guards shrink back as the POWs, lowering their
rifles and bayonets as...
Blackie and The Scots jump on each other. Wrestling into the
water.
Tinker, Fitzgerald, and Miller shout with relief and tears.
Harris is slow to completely understand what has happened. A
smile spreads across his broken face.
Louie stands, paralyzed. He doesn’t know how to react. He
sinks to his knees in the water. He covers his face. He made
it. He survived.
He lays back in the water and opens his arms just like every
finish line. Victory.

A TIME MAGAZINE is found in the care package. Its cover is

It looks as if The Bird left in a hurry. Most of his
belongings are gone but among the few items that remain is a
family photo. Giving us a clue into the monster. An image of
him as a young, innocent boy with his strong, Military-leader
father.
Along the wall is his kendo stick.
The enemy escaped. Louie allows this to all sink in.

Bursting through the crowd are Louise (still wearing Louie’s
airman’s wings pin), Anthony, Pete, Sylvia and Virginia.
Louie!

PETE

Louise bursts into tears. Louie runs directly to her and
enfolds her in his arms. Anthony wraps his arms around them
both.
Louie, Anthony and Louise with their arms around each other,
not moving, not letting go. There are tears in Louie’s eyes.

The sound of cheering voices, cars, tramping feet.
ON SCREEN IT READS - LOUIE FINALLY REALIZED HIS DREAM, AND
RAN AGAIN IN THE OLYMPICS.
The shot develops to find the road that runs past the old
camp. It's lined with people, wrapped up against the cold,
smiling and cheering.
Cars appear between the cheering people. One carries a TV
crew. And there in the road, in running gear, is 80-year-old
Lou Zamperini.
LOUIE ZAMPERINI lopes over the snow, Olympic torch held high,
beaming all over his face.
ON SCREEN:

AT AGE 80. IN JAPAN.

Smiling and cheering beautiful Japanese faces surround him.

Louie smiles and waves at the Japanese people smiling and
cheering him on. The beautiful faces of the Japanese
children.
Unity and love. The true undying spirit of the Olympics. The
true undying spirit of Louis Zamperini; running smiling,
joyful. Unbroken.
