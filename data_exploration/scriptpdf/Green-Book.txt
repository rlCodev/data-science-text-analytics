“New York City, 1962”

EXT. COPACABANA - 10 EAST 60TH ST. - NYC - NIGHT
The famous red awning with COPACABANA in white block letters
hangs over the entrance of the world-renowned nightclub. A
long line of well-dressed customers fills the sidewalk
waiting to get in.
OVER THIS - WE HEAR the opening horns of Bobby Rydell’s
version of “THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC”...
INT. COPACABANA - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The vibe is electric. SIX HUNDRED PATRONS pack the tables in
the main room. Brazilian in theme, the Copa décor is art deco
throughout, filled with palm trees illuminated by blue and
pink hues. Pure elegance.
Peppering the crowd... gorgeous COPA GIRLS, white-jacketed
WAITERS, MAITRE D’S in Black Tuxedo Jackets, CAPTAINS in Blue
Tux Jackets, and BOUNCERS in Red Tux Jackets.
On stage in front of the Orchestra, tuxedo-clad BOBBY RYDELL.
The crowd APPLAUDS.
BOBBY RYDELL
Thank you very much! Welcome to
Jules Podell’s Copacabana! I’m
Bobby Rydell and I’m happy to be
here!
(singing)
That old Black Magic has me in its
spell...
THE SONG CONTINUES THROUGH THIS ENTIRE SEQUENCE...
FRANK “TONY LIP” VALLELONGA, 40s, Copa bouncer, moves quickly
through the crowd. Lip is imposing with a charismatic
presence. You don’t mess with this guy.
Following Lip, an ATTRACTIVE COUPLE. Lip leads them to a
table near the front of the stage. The man slips Lip some
cash.
The Orchestra kicks in big, the room is jumping...
At a back booth, JULES PODELL, 60, Copa owner, a tough-asnails bulldog of a man. He taps his diamond ring on the table
to the beat of the song.

2.
INT. COPACABANA - COAT CHECK - CONTINUOUS
Lip trolls for customers who will tip him for a table. He
NOTICES...
JOEY LOSCUDO, 50s, a Mob Boss, entering the club followed by
his CREW. Loscudo walks over to the COAT-CHECK GIRL, takes
off his coat and hat, hands them to her.
LOSCUDO
Guard this hat with your life... My
mother gave it to me.
He winks.
COAT-CHECK GIRL
Yes, Mr. Loscudo...
He hands the Coat-Check Girl some money. The MAITRE D’,
CARMINE, walks over.
Joey!

CARMINE

LOSCUDO
Hey, Carmine!
Carmine slips Lip some cash.
CARMINE
That’s not necessary...
LOSCUDO
Come on. You know I saw this kid
Rydell last year in Philly. Nobody
knew who he was.
CARMINE
Well they know him now...
They hug, then Carmine escorts Loscudo and his ENTOURAGE into
the main room. Lip approaches the Coat-Check Girl.
LIP
Gimme Loscudo’s hat.
COAT-CHECK GIRL
But he said...
LIP
I know, just give it to me...
He bangs her a couple bucks, she turns the hat over to him.

3.
INT. COPACABANA - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
RYDELL’S STILL SINGING, THE JOINT’S ROCKING... A FIGHT breaks
out... FOUR GOOMBAHS pound each other. Tables flip, glass
breaks, patrons scream...
ANGLE ON Podell as he jumps up...
PODELL
TONY LIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!!!
Lip is already on the move, running to the fight...
It’s pandemonium, but Rydell doesn’t stop. He and the
Orchestra building the speed and intensity of the song...
Lip is joined by Carmine, and some BOUNCERS, all of them
grappling with the Goombahs. They quickly RUSH THEM OUT OF
THE ROOM....
EXT. COPACABANA - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Everyone comes CRASHING out the front door. Lip throws the
Goombah down the steps to the street. He jumps up.
GOOMBAH
YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME, YOU
PUNK?!
LIP
Do yourself a favor--go home with
your friends.
GOOMBAH
Don’t you tell me where to go! Do
you know who I am?! I’m goin’ back
in there!
LIP
Nah, you’re not.
The Goombah TAKES A SWING at Lip and it’s on. Lips KNOCKS HIM
ON HIS ASS, then jumps on him and starts to BASH HIS FACE IN.
CLOSE ON - Lip, brutally punching, his fists bloody, as WE
HEAR O.S. APPLAUSE and
SMASH CUT TO
INT. COPACABANA - STAGE - CONTINUOUS
The band’s swinging as Bobby Rydell delivers the big climax
to the song...

called loooooooove!
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. COPACABANA - COAT CHECK - LATER - NIGHT
A line of people wait behind mob boss Joey Loscudo as he
screams at the Coat-Check Girl. Carmine stands by.
LOSCUDO
I‘ll burn this place down! Where’s
my hat!
COAT-CHECK GIRL
I’m sorry, Mr. Loscudo, I went to
the ladies room, I was only gone a
minute...
LOSCUDO
Someone better find it!
CARMINE
It’ll turn up, I swear it’ll turn
up.
LOSCUDO
Really? You tell that fat Jew
bastard Podell that if it doesn’t
turn up, I’ll burn this place down!
You hear me? I’ll burn the Copa
down!
EXT. COPACABANA - ENTRANCE - NIGHT - LATER
Lip, Carmine, and another bouncer, DANNY, smoke cigarettes,
lean against a dinged-up ‘55 BUICK Sedan.
A poster at the Copa entrance reads: BOBBY RYDELL - SOLD OUT!
A worker pastes a banner over it: COPA CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS
NOVEMBER/DECEMBER - SEE YOU IN JANUARY WITH SAMMY DAVIS, JR.!
CARMINE
Jesus Christ. Loscudo is out of his
mind.
DANNY
We earned our money tonight.

(CONTINUED)

5.
CONTINUED:
CARMINE
Lip, I thought you were gonna kill
that guy.
LIP
Better him than me. What are you
gonna do while we’re closed?
DANNY
I don’t know. Maybe work at my
Uncle’s pizza joint.
LIP
(to Carmine)
What about you?
CARMINE
I’m gonna drink for two months.
The men straighten up as Jules Podell exits the club.
JULES PODELL
Take me home, Lip.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. JILLY’S SALOON - NIGHT
LOSCUDO’S HAT GETS PLOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A TABLE...
PULL BACK... Luscudo sits in the corner booth, holding court
with JILLY and friends.
LOSCUDO
My hat! Jesus Christ, if you had
tits, I’d kiss ya! How the hell’d
you find it?
ANGLE ON LIP standing in front of the table.
LIP
Heard it was missing, so I looked
into it.
LOSCUDO
I wanted to kill that broad.
LIP
Wasn’t her fault.
JILLY RIZZO
Who had the balls to clip it?

(CONTINUED)

6.
CONTINUED:
LIP
Don’t worry about it, I took care
of him.
LOSCUDO
I hope you gave him some beating.
Loscudo pulls out a wad of cash, peels off a C-note.
LIP
No, I can’t. It was my pleasure,
Mr. Loscudo.
Loscudo SLAMS the MONEY into Lip’s hand.
LOSCUDO
Bullshit. And from now on you don’t
have to call me Mister Loscudo, ya
hear me?
Lip smiles.
EXT. LIP’S APARTMENT - BRONX - DAWN
A six-story brick building with fire escapes framing the
windows. Parked cars fill both sides of the street. Lip’s car
pulls up and parks in front of a FIRE HYDRANT. He gets out,
grabs a garbage can, and PUTS IT OVER THE HYDRANT.
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - MORNING
Lip ENTERS the small one-bedroom apartment. He moves to the
kitchen, opens the refrigerator, chugs half a bottle of milk.
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING
Lip ENTERS. Sleeping in the bed, Lip’s wife DOLORES, late
30s, pretty. Beside her, NICK, 9, and FRANKIE, 7.
Lip takes off a ring, his watch, places them on top of the
bureau. Empties his pockets of crumpled wads of cash.
Lip strips down to a t-shirt and boxer shorts, gets in bed,
snuggles up to Dolores. She wakes, kisses him.
DOLORES
‘Morning...
‘Night...

INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
CLOSE ON - A BLACK AND WHITE TV, THE YANKEES PLAY THE SAN
FRANCISCO GIANTS, GAME 6 OF THE WORLD SERIES.
PHIL RIZUTTO (V.O.)
“Roger Maris at the plate, Pierce
checks the signs...”
PULL BACK -- On the couch watching the game, Lip’s Father,
NICOLA, 70s, brother RUDY, 30s, Dolores’ father, ANTHONY,
70s, and her two brothers JOHNNY, 40s, and LOUIE, 30s.
JOHNNY
Come on, Roger! Hit one out!
RUDY
Be quiet, you’re gonna jinx it!
Lip ENTERS still wearing his t-shirt and white boxers.
LIP
(sarcastic)
Johnny, think you can yell a little
louder?
JOHNNY
Maris is up...
LIP
Yeah, so am I now. What the hell
are you guys doing here?
Johnny discreetly nods toward the kitchen where we see TWO
BLACK WORKMEN laying down linoleum. The kids, Nick and Frank,
play with plastic Green Army soldiers in the corner.
JOHNNY
Figured we’d come up and keep
Dolores company...
BACK TO SCENE - Lip gets the point.
ANTHONY
(in Italian)
You shouldn’t be sleeping in the
middle of the day, leaving my
daughter here alone with these
sacks of coal.
NICOLA
(in Italian)
And why do you hire them to do an
Italian’s job? It’s a disgrace.
(CONTINUED)

8.
CONTINUED:
LIP
(in Italian)
I don’t know who they’re gonna
send.
ON Dolores - she pours a couple glasses of lemonade and hands
the drinks to the Black Workmen.
BLACK WORKMAN
Thank you, ma’am.
Lip watches as the Workmen drink the lemonade, then Dolores
takes the glasses and PUTS THEM IN THE SINK. As she leads the
men to the door, we go...
ON THE TV - MARIS SWINGS... CRACK!
PHIL RIZUTTO (V.O.)
“Deep to center field, holy cow he
did it! A home run for Roger Maris!
Holy cow!”
Johnny jumps up, they all CHEER...
Except Lip, whose eyes keep darting toward the GLASSES IN THE
SINK. Dolores comes back and Lip joins her in the kitchen. He
pours himself a glass of water, dips his finger in the sauce
she’s cooking. Dolores slaps his hand away.
DOLORES
Get dressed, Tony, we’re gonna eat.
She picks up a big platter of meatballs and sausage and takes
it into the dining room. Lip glances into the sink.
CLOSE ON - The Black Workmen’s two empty lemonade glasses.
Lip takes the GLASSES out of the sink, DROPS THEM INTO THE
GARBAGE.
CUT TO:
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - DINETTE - LATER
Lip’s at the table, dressed now. Wine and plates of rigatoni.
Joining them for lunch are FRAN, Johnny’s wife, and LYNN,
Louie’s wife. Dolores makes the sign of the cross.
DOLORES
Bless us our Lord, for these thy
gifts, which we are about to
receive, from thy bounty through
Christ our Lord, Amen.

(CONTINUED)

9.
CONTINUED:
They all make the sign of the cross.
Salute.

NICOLA

They start stuffing their faces.
DOLORES
If anyone hears about a job for
Tony, let us know.
LIP
(nobody’s business)
Dolores...
RUDY
What happened, you get fired?
DOLORES
No, Copa’s closing for repairs. He
needs something for just a couple
months.
JOHNNY
I’ll ask around.
NICOLA
(in Italian)
Mister big shot. Always spend,
spend, spend. No job, he gets
himself a new kitchen floor.
LIP
(in Italian)
Come on, Pop. The kids were gettin’
splinters in their feet.
FRAN
All the people he knows, he’ll find
something.
JOHNNY
He had a great job at the
sanitation department.
(to Lip)
You shouldn’t have punched out the
foreman.
LIP
He shouldn’t have woke me up.
Everyone LAUGHS.

INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY - LATER
Dolores is cleaning up. She’s scraping a plate into the
garbage can when she notices something O.S.
DOLORES’ POV - Two empty glasses in the garbage...
She SIGHS, disappointed in her husband, then picks up the
glasses from the garbage pail and puts them back into the
sink.
CUT TO:
INT. GORMAN’S HOT DOGS - DAY
Johnny, Lip, and Lip’s youngest boy, Frankie, ENTER.
JOHNNY
I’m tellin’ you, this is gonna be
the easiest fifty bucks you ever
made.
They walk over to a table where FAT PAULIE, 40s, is waiting
with the owner, GORMAN, and a couple other CUSTOMERS.
FAT PAULIE
Johnny told me you ate forty-eight
White Castle burgers in one
sitting.
FRANKIE
Cheeseburgers.
FAT PAULIE
I don’t believe you.
LIP
What do I care if you believe me?
(beat)
Gorman, who’s got the record for
hotdogs here?
GORMAN
Fat Paulie. Fifteen.
JOHNNY
Why wasn’t Lip in on that contest?
FAT PAULIE
What contest? I was hungry.
The guys CHUCKLE.

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED:
GORMAN
Bet’s simple. Half a C-note. Most
hotdogs in an hour wins. With
toppings.
Lip sizes him up.
LIP
What the hell you weigh?
Two-sixty.

FAT PAULIE

JOHNNY
Aaaaay. Your left ass weighs twosixty.
Fat Paulie raises his right hand.
FAT PAULIE
May my mother-in-law drop dead on
the spot if I’m lyin’.
They all LAUGH.
LIP
Okay, you’re on.
SMASH CUT:
INT. GORMAN’S HOT DOGS - LATER
The table filled with an assortment of hot dogs. Everyone
CHEERS, CLAPS, as Lip and Fat Paulie STUFF THEIR FACES.
JOHNNY
Come on, Lip, pick it up! The baby
elephant just hit nineteen!
Lip sweats, slows down, looks like he’s gonna puke. The crowd
cheers as Fat Paulie calmly takes a big bite of another dog.
CUT TO:
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Lip and Frankie ENTER. Frankie runs over to Nick who is doing
homework.
LIP
Nicky, you doin’ your homework?

(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED:
Yeah.

NICK

DOLORES
Where were you?
Lip plops down in a chair, exhausted.
LIP
Gorman’s. Fat Paulie bet me fifty
bucks he could eat more hot dogs
than me. He knocked off twentyeight. Guy’s an animal.
DOLORES
Are you crazy--you lost fifty
dollars?!
LIP
Dolores, please. I ate thirty.
Lip pulls out the winnings. She plucks the bills from his
hand.
DOLORES
Thank God. The gas bill came in
today.
THE PHONE RINGS. Lip answers.
Yeah?

LIP

INT. COPACABANA - DAY - SAME
Jules Podell sits at his table in the empty Copa. He sips a
cup of coffee as WORKERS clear tablecloths, flip chairs onto
tables, etc.
JULES PODELL
(into phone)
Hey, Lip, some guy called over here
-- a doctor’s lookin’ for a driver.
You interested?
INTERCUT CONVERSATION:
Yeah.

LIP

JULES PODELL
They’re interviewing guys tomorrow
afternoon. Here’s the address.

13.
EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - 881 SEVENTH AVENUE - NYC - DAY
Lip, wearing black slacks and a bowling-style shirt, stands
at the front of... CARNEGIE HALL...
He takes out a piece of paper, looks at it. This can’t be the
place...
INT. CARNEGIE HALL - CONCERT HALL - DAY
Magnificent. Lip enters, moves down the aisle. He takes in
the spectacle.
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Excuse me. We’re not open right
now...
Lip turns to face the BOX OFFICE MANAGER across the room.
BOX OFFICE MANAGER
But you’re welcome to buy tickets
to tonight’s performance.
LIP
‘There a doctor’s office ‘round
here? I think I got the wrong
address.
Lip holds up the paper.
BOX OFFICE MANAGER
You have the correct address. Dr.
Shirley lives upstairs, above the
hall.
INT. DON SHIRLEY’S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
Lip walks down the hall. Two ENGLISH BUTLER-TYPES sit in
chairs outside a door. The door opens and an ASIAN MAN, black
suit and tie, carrying a briefcase, exits.
At the door stands an Indian valet, AMIT, white Nehru shirt,
white linen pants, clipboard in hand.
LIP
I’m here for the driver job. Tony
Lip.
Amit checks the list, flips a page, can’t find it.
LIP (CONT’D)
I should be on there.

(CONTINUED)

14.
CONTINUED:
AMIT
No Tony Lip. I do have a Tony
Val...Valle...
LIP
Vallelonga. That’s me.
AMIT
Fill this out while you wait.
What?

LIP

AMIT
Fill. It. Out. While you wait.
Amit hands him a clipboard and a pen, then Lip takes a seat
next to the butlers.
INT. SHIRLEY’S APARTMENT - DAY - LATER
Amit escorts Lip in. CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS.
AMIT
Take a seat.
Lip sits in a leather chair and Amit EXITS. Lip looks around.
Never seen anything like it. Thirty-foot ceilings, giant
skylight, enormous French windows overlooking Manhattan.
It’s filled to the rafters with paintings, African art,
sculptures, Chinese lanterns, a giant gold Buddha, and two
six-foot elephant tusks. A crystal chandelier hangs above a
black Steinway Concert Grand Piano.
A THRONE... an actual King’s throne... sits on a riser, back
against the glass window.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mr. Vallelonga, sorry to keep you
waiting...
Lip turns...Standing before him is DR. DONALD SHIRLEY, late
30s, black, resplendent in a traditional African robe. He’s
bedecked in assorted chain necklaces, bracelets, watch, and
rings. Dr. Shirley speaks in a clipped, refined manner.
DR. SHIRLEY
I’m Dr. Donald Shirley.
Lip’s taken aback. Not what he expected. He stands.

(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED:
Hi. Tony.

LIP

Shirley extends his hand. They shake.
DR. SHIRLEY
Please, have a seat.
Lip sits. Shirley sits on his “throne,” looking down at Lip.
LIP
This is some place you got here.
Motioning to the Elephant Tusks.
LIP (CONT’D)
Them horns real?
DR. SHIRLEY
Elephant tusks. Yes.
Lip nods, points to the chain around Shirley’s neck.
LIP
What about that? That a molar?
A what?
A molar.

DR. SHIRLEY
LIP

Lip points to his side teeth.
LIP (CONT’D)
Like a shark tooth? Or a tiger’s?
DR. SHIRLEY
Um, no. It was a gift.
Oh.

LIP

(looks around)
I thought I was going to an office.
They said a doctor needed a driver.
DR. SHIRLEY
That’s all they told you?
Lip shrugs.

(CONTINUED)

16.
CONTINUED: (2)
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Actually, it’s a bit more
complicated than that. Have you
ever driven professionally before?
LIP
Sanitation.
(beat)
Garbage trucks.
Off Shirley’s unimpressed look.
LIP (CONT’D)
Plus I drive my boss home at night.
I can drive anything.
DR. SHIRLEY
I see. What other experience do you
have?
LIP
I worked a lot of joints. The Wagon
Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa...
DR. SHIRLEY
In what capacity?
LIP
What do you mean?
DR. SHIRLEY
What did you do there?
Lip chews on that. You can smell the wood burning...
LIP
Public relations...
Shirley nods, understanding.
DR. SHIRLEY
Well, first of all, Tony, I’m not a
medical doctor. I’m a musician.
LIP
You mean like songs?
DR. SHIRLEY
Yes. I’m about to start a concert
tour, the majority of which will be
down South.
LIP
Atlantic City?

(CONTINUED)

17.
CONTINUED: (3)
DR. SHIRLEY
The deep south. We start in the
midwest, but then we’re taking a
hard left. Kentucky, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and on down
through the Delta.
(beat)
Do you foresee any issues working
for a black man?
LIP
No, no... ’fact just yesterday me
and the wife had a couple colored
guys over the house. For drinks.
Shirley takes a BEAT.
DR. SHIRLEY
Oh, I see. You’re married.
LIP
Yup. Two kids.
DR. SHIRLEY
I don’t know if this is the proper
job for a married man.
LIP
Why, we bringing broads?
Shirley shoots him a look.
DR. SHIRLEY
My point is, you’ll be gone for
eight straight weeks--with no
breaks--right up until Christmas.
You’re quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?
LIP
Depends on what you’re paying.
DR. SHIRLEY
Ninety dollars a week, plus room
and board. But let me be crystal
clear... I’m not simply hiring a
chauffeur. I need someone who can
handle my itinerary. I need a
personal assistant. I need a valet.
I need someone who will launder my
clothes, shine my shoes...
LIP
Good luck, Doc.
(CONTINUED)

18.
CONTINUED: (4)
Lip stands, heads for the door. Shirley steps down off his
throne.
Tony...

DR. SHIRLEY

Lip turns back, faces Shirley.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
I had my record label ask around
town to find me the right man. Your
name came up more than once. You’ve
impressed a lot of people by the
way you handle... trouble. That’s
why I called and asked about your
availability.
Lip thinks about it.
LIP
Look, I got no problem being on the
road with you. But I ain’t no
butler, I ain’t ironing shirts, and
I’m not shining nobody’s shoes. You
need someone to get you from point
A to point B? You need someone to
make sure there’s no problems along
the way -- and you going through
the deep South, believe me, there’s
gonna be problems. So if you want
me, it’s gotta be a buck and a
quarter a week. Or go hire the
little Chink that just pranced out
of here and see how far you get.
Shirley stares, stone-faced.
DR. SHIRLEY
Well, Mr. Vallelonga...thank you
for coming in.
As Lip turns and walks out, we -CUT TO:
EXT. JOE & JOE RESTAURANT - BRONX - LATE AFTERNOON
A tired Lip comes walking down the sidewalk and ENTERS.
INT. JOE & JOE RESTAURANT - BAR/DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Smoky, packed, loud... Lip snakes his way to BOBBY, 40s,
CHINESE, who’s behind the bar.

(CONTINUED)

19.
CONTINUED:
LIP
Bobby, give me a Rheingold. Ice
cold.
Bobby pours a draft of Rheingold, slides it in front of him.
BOBBY
(concerned)
Mister Tony. Augie asking about
you.
Lip isn’t happy to hear this. A CUSTOMER pounds on the bar.
CUSTOMER
Come on, I’m dying of thirst over
here!
BOBBY
Shut up, I’m talking!
He turns back to Lip.
When?

LIP

BOBBY
Now. He in his box.
Lip drains the beer, leaves the bar area, weaves his way
through the crowd to an ENCLOSED, PRIVATE BOOTH with a
curtain blocking the people inside. Lip hesitates, then opens
the curtain.
HIS POV - AUGIE, rough-looking, dead eyes, sits there
stuffing his face with linguini and clam sauce. TWO
PSYCHOPATHS sit with him. The Psychos look on blankly. A
lesser man would shit his pants.
AUGIE
(intense)
Tony Lip. What the hell happened at
the Copa? I heard you split a guy’s
face open.
Lip shrugs.
AUGIE (CONT’D)
That guy you hit. He was one of
Charlie the Hand’s crew.
LIP
Then he shoulda known better.

(CONTINUED)

20.
CONTINUED: (2)
Augie mad-dogs him, never losing eye contact as he stuffs his
face. Lip doesn’t blink.
AUGIE
The Hand wanted me to look into it.
I spoke to Podell. Whole thing was
over a piece of ass, right?
Lip shrugs.
AUGIE (CONT’D)
A beef like that should never
happen in the club. They were out
of line. So we squashed it.
He wipes olive oil off his chin.
AUGIE (CONT’D)
Sit down. Have something to eat.
LIP
Thanks, but I already ate.
Augie chews away, not sure if he believes him.
AUGIE
You looking to earn some extra
scharole? I could keep you busy
while the Copa’s down.
LIP
What I gotta do?
Things...

AUGIE

Lip thinks about it.
LIP
Appreciate it, but I’m gonna spend
some time with the family.
AUGIE
Don’t be stupid. You can make a few
bucks, buy something nice for your
wife.
LIP
I’m good. I’m flush right now.

The EL TRAIN thunders above Lip as he enters a PAWN SHOP.
INT. PAWN SHOP - BRONX - EARLY EVENING
CLOSE ON Lip’s WRISTWATCH on the counter. The pawn guy,
CHARLIE, looks up at Lip, concerned. Reluctantly, he hands
Lip cash and a ticket.
PAWN GUY
Here’s fifty. Give me sixty before
Christmas, you get it back.
Lip turns to leave.
PAWN GUY (CONT’D)
Hey, Lip... everything okay?
LIP

You got beak trouble, Charlie? Mind
your business.
Lip walks out.
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Lip sits watching TV as Dolores hands him a bowl of spaghetti.
DOLORES
So what happened with the doctor
interview?
LIP
He ain’t a real doctor, he’s a
piano player.
Lip digs in, starts stuffing his face.
DOLORES
I don’t understand--why’d they say
he was a doctor?
LIP
I don’t know. I think he’s like a
doctor of piano-playing or
something.
DOLORES
You can be that?

(CONTINUED)

22.
CONTINUED:
LIP
I guess. He lives on top of
Carnegie Hall. You shoulda seen
this place, Dee--it was filled with
statues and all kinds of fancy
crap. And he was sitting on a
friggin’ throne all dressed up like
the king of the jungle bunnies.
DOLORES
He’s colored? You wouldn’t last a
week with him.
LIP
For the right money, I would.
As Lip continues eating, we go...
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
Lip and Dolores are asleep in bed, the kids asleep in another
bed across the room. THE PHONE RINGS. Lip and Dolores wake
up. Lip looks at the clock--8 a.m. He answers the phone.
LIP
(into phone)
Hello... Yeah... Really?... Why?...
Okay, hold on.
Lip puts his hand over the receiver.
DOLORES
Everything okay?
It’s him.
Who?

LIP
DOLORES

LIP
Dr. Shirley, the piano guy. He
wants to talk to you.
She sits up.

Yes, that is a long time...
Dolores looks at Lip as Shirley talks on.
DOLORES (CONT’D)
(beat)
It is...Yes, I’m sure...Thank you
for calling...Goodbye.
Dolores hangs up.
LIP
What he say?
Dolores looks stunned.
DOLORES
He wanted to know if I’d be okay
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months. He
said he’d pay you what you asked
for.
Lip looks surprised. She rolls away from him.
LIP
It’s good money, Dolores. You know
we need it. I can’t be eatin’
thirty hot dogs every day.
Dolores wells up.
DOLORES
I know...I said it was okay for you
to go.
EXT. LIP’S APARTMENT - MORNING
Dion's “RUNAROUND SUE” drifts lazily from a transistor
radio... Laundry hangs from fire escapes. OLD ITALIAN WOMEN
sit in folding chairs CHATTING while Grandpa Nicola, Grandpa
Anthony and Rudy watch Nick and Frankie play.
A 1963 CHRYSLER NEW YORKER and a 1961 CADILLAC SEDAN are
parked in front.

Lip, wearing a well-worn black suit, stands next to the
Chrysler talking to a RECORD EXEC, 40s, sharply dressed, nononsense, and his nebbishy ASSISTANT. The Record Exec hands
Lip a check.
RECORD EXEC
Here’s the first half of your pay.
You’ll get the rest when the tour’s
over.
LIP
Uh-uh, I gotta get paid every week.
RECORD EXEC
Sorry, that’s not how the record
company does it.
Lip glares at him.
RECORD EXEC (CONT’D)
We gotta have some guarantee you’ll
finish the job.
LIP
Why the hell wouldn’t I finish the
job? I took it, didn’t I?
The Record Exec glances at his assistant, then back at Lip.
RECORD EXEC
Then you’ve got nothing to worry
about.
The Exec holds out the car keys. As Lip reaches for them, the
Exec pulls them back.
RECORD EXEC (CONT’D)
Here’s the deal, Mr. Vallelonga.
It’s your job to get Don to all his
tour dates on time. If he misses
any shows, you’re not getting your
back-end.
Lip takes the keys.
LIP
He’s not gonna miss any shows.
RECORD EXEC
Good. And you’re going to need
this.
He hands Lip a small GREEN BOOK.

RECORD EXEC (CONT’D)
It’s the book I told you about.
Sometimes you’re staying in the
same hotels, and sometimes you’re
not.
As Lip glances at the book, we -ANGLE ON Lip’s brother-in-law, Johnny, exiting the building.
He carries a suitcase over to the Cadillac.
As the Record Exec and his assistant drive off in the
Chrysler, Lip walks over to Johnny.
JOHNNY
(re: Caddy)
Madonne. This the new one?
LIP
The record company rented it.
Lip opens the trunk, Johnny puts the suitcase in.
JOHNNY
So what’d my sister say about you
being gone for three weeks?
LIP
Eight weeks.
Johnny smirks.
JOHNNY
Yeah, right. Ten-to-one you slap
the moolie out and come home under
a month.
Lip smiles, shoves Johnny. Dolores approaches with the kids.
DOLORES
Come here. Say goodbye to your
father.
Nick and Frankie run to Lip, hug him. They get emotional.
LIP
Stop that. You gotta be big boys,
take care of your mother...
HE give the kids kisses, then they run away.

DOLORES
Did you go to the A-A-A for the
maps?
LIP
The record guy gave me maps and
directions with the itinerary
thing. And this.
Lip pulls out the small green book that the Record Exec gave
him.
DOLORES
(reading)
The Negro Motorist Green-Book?
LIP
Lists all the places coloreds can
stay down south. Like if you’re
traveling while black.
DOLORES
Traveling while black?
LIP
Yeah. Like if you’re black but you
gotta travel for some reason.
DOLORES
They got a special book for that?
I guess.

LIP

DOLORES
Did you pack an iron?
LIP
I ain’t lugging around no iron,
Dee.
DOLORES
How you gonna keep your pants
pressed?
LIP
I’ll put ‘em under my mattress.
Dolores takes Lip’s hand.
DOLORES
I want you to write me a letter
every chance you get.

LIP
Aw, come on, Dee, I can’t write
letters.
DOLORES
Take you five minutes. Promise me.
LIP
I can’t write, it’s embarrassing-they ain’t gonna be no good.
DOLORES
It’s a lot cheaper than callin’
long distance, Tony. Promise me
you’ll write.
Lip SIGHS.
LIP
Okay. I promise. I’ll try.
She looks at him.
Yeah.

LIP (CONT’D)

Lip hugs and kisses her. He gives her the check.
LIP (CONT’D)
Put this in the bank today.
She takes it and hands him a brown paper bag.
DOLORES
I made a couple veal-cutlet
sandwiches for you and Dr. Shirley.
Be careful. I love you.
LIP
Love you, too.
DOLORES
You better be home at Christmas or
don’t come home at all!
As they kiss, Grandpa Nicola CALLS OUT to Lip:
NICOLA
(in Italian)
He who arrives late has no bed!
Lip waves goodbye to everyone. WE STAY ON Dolores as he
drives away...

EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - 881 SEVENTH AVENUE - NYC - DAY
Lip parks Shirley’s rented Cadillac in front of an identical
Cadillac, gets out, opens the trunk. Smoking next to the
other Cadillac is OLEG MALAKHOV, 30s, Russian, wears glasses,
and GEORGE DYER, 30s.
Lip takes out a cigarette, is about to light it, then notices
Oleg smoking. He puts the cigarette back in the pack, then
walks over to Oleg and George.
LIP
Bum a smoke?
Oleg sizes Lip up, then reluctantly hands him a cigarette.
LIP (CONT’D)
I’m Tony. You the band?
OLEG
(Russian accent)
Oleg. Cello.
GEORGE
George. Bass. And we’re not a band,
we’re a trio.
Dr. Shirley exits the building, impeccably dressed in a silk
suit. He’s followed by his valet, Amit, who awkwardly carries
three large pieces of Shirley’s EXPENSIVE LUGGAGE.
Lip opens the back door of the car. Shirley gets in. Amit
drops the bags he was carrying on the sidewalk. Shirley sits
in the back seat. Amit leans in, places a RED CASHMERE
BLANKET over Shirley’s legs.
DR. SHIRLEY
Thank you, Amit.
AMIT
Have a wonderful trip, Doctor.
Amit shuts the car door. The luggage sits on the sidewalk
between Lip and Amit. Lip smokes his butt, shoots Amit an “It
ain’t my job” look. Standoff.
Amit caves, picks up the three bags, one at a time, puts them
into the trunk. Lip SLAMS the trunk shut.

EXT. ROUTE 80 WEST - NEW JERSEY - LATER - DAY
Dr. Shirley’s Cadillac drives west on Route 80, followed by
Oleg and George.
INT. CADILLAC - DAY
Lip’s driving fast, smoking faster. Shirley chokes on the
blue haze filling the car, cracks his window.
Lip reaches into the brown paper bag, pulls out a wax-paperwrapped sandwich with “Tony” written on it, peels back the
foil. Veal cutlet and peppers sandwich on a loaf of Italian
bread. Still smoking, Lip starts to eat.
DR. SHIRLEY
Tony, when we arrive in a city, the
first thing I’d like you to do is
check the piano where I’m playing.
Make sure it’s a Steinway as per my
contract.
Lip pulls out a pen, writes “STAIN WAY” on the map.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
And could you see to it that I have
a bottle of Cutty Sark in my room
every night.
LIP
Every night?
Lip smiles.
LIP (CONT’D)
Well if you ever need any help with
that...
DR. SHIRLEY
I won’t. And ten-and-two on the
wheel, please.
Tony loses the smile. Shirley slides over in his seat so that
he’s directly behind Lip.

Birmingham, yes. It’s a Christmas

LIP
Any way we could hit the road early
the next morning so we could be back
home in time for Christmas Eve?
DR. SHIRLEY
We’ll see. Could you please put the
cigarette out?
Why?

LIP

DR. SHIRLEY
Because I can’t breathe back here.
LIP
What are you talking about? Smoke’s
going into my lungs. I’m doing all
the work here.
Thank you.

DR. SHIRLEY

Lip thinks about it, defiantly takes one long last drag off
the heater, then another, then finally FLICKS IT OUTSIDE.
Lip rolls up his window, shoots a look at the second
sandwich, “Dr. Shirley” written on it. FUCK THIS GUY. He
opens it, stuffs Shirley’s sandwich in his mouth, looks
straight ahead.

Good. We’ll meet you at the hotel
in Pittsburgh.
DR. SHIRLEY
(in Russian)
Make a reservation for dinner.
We’ll rehearse immediately after.
See you there.
Oleg gives Lip the hairy eyeball, blows past him.

(to himself)
Hell’s he looking at?
Lip looks in the mirror at Shirley.
LIP (CONT’D)
You speak German, huh?
DR. SHIRLEY
That was Russian.
LIP
Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in
the army. I can pick up a little of
what you’re sayin’. Be careful,
Krauts are all sneaks. Kennedy
shoulda bombed ‘em when we had the
chance--plus now them Cuban
bastards.
Shirley rolls his eyes.

Where they going anyway? Ain’t they
supposed to be following us?

INT. DINER - DAY
Lip and Shirley sit in a booth eating lunch. Shirley picks at
a tuna salad while Lip chows down on a pot roast. Shirley
watches Lip, amazed at the ferocity with which he attacks his
meal.
DR. SHIRLEY
How is that?
Lip thinks about it.
Salty.

LIP

Lip continues to stuff his face.
DR. SHIRLEY
Have you ever thought of being a
food critic?
Lip looks up, hopeful.
LIP
Not really, but...why? Is there
money in that?
DR. SHIRLEY
I’m just saying, you have a
marvelous way with words when
describing food. Salty. So vivid.
One can almost taste it.
Lip feels the jab.
LIP
I’m saying it’s salty, and salt’s
cheatin’. Any cook can make things
salty. But to make it taste good
without the salt, with just the
other flavors, that’s the trick.
See, when you-(CONTINUED)

DR. SHIRLEY
We should be going soon if we
expect to get to Pittsburgh by
dinner.
LIP
You know, when I was in the army I
knew a guy from Pittsburgh, but he
called it Titsburgh because he said
all the girls there have big tits.
DR. SHIRLEY
That’s absurd. Why would women in
Pittsburgh have larger breasts
than, say, women in New York?
Lip shrugs.
LIP
‘The hell I know? Guess we’ll find
out, huh?
Lip goes back to his plate.
LIP (CONT’D)
By the way, when you hired me, my
wife went out bought one of your
records--’one about the orphans.
Orphans?

DR. SHIRLEY

LIP
Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire?
Shirley has to think a moment.
Orpheus.
What?

DR. SHIRLEY
LIP

DR. SHIRLEY
Orpheus in the Underworld. It’s
based on a French Opera. And those
kids on the cover? They were demons
in hell.

No shit? Must of been naughty kids.

I gotta take a leak.
Here? Now?

DR. SHIRLEY

LIP
What, you want me to piss my pants?
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The Cadillac stops on the shoulder of the road next to some
trees. Lip gets out, takes a few steps... then realizes he
forgot something...
Lip goes back, opens the driver’s side door and GRABS HIS
WALLET OFF THE DASH.
Shirley and Lip’s eyes meet for a moment. Then, wallet in
hand, Lip heads to the woods to pee.

From this perch, the courtyard is illuminated by the
reflection of the pool light. Lip steps out, fires up a
smoke, takes in the cool breeze.

grab-ass with TWO WOMEN, drinking, LAUGHING...
Lip peers across the courtyard, finds Dr. Shirley sitting on
the patio outside his room, drink in hand, a half-empty
bottle of Cutty beside him.
Lip observes a moment, goes back into his room.

INT. PENN SHERATON HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY
Lip, wearing a black suit, sits reading a paper. Shirley
wearing a tuxedo, enters, crosses to Lip. Shirley pulls a
roll of cash out of his pocket, peels off some bills, gives
them to Lip.
DR. SHIRLEY
Take this for any incidentals we
may need. If you want something for
yourself, you don’t have to ask me,
just make sure you keep the
receipts. When it runs low, let me
know.
Lip nods. They walk towards the exit.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
One more thing--we will be
attending many events before and
after the concerts, interacting
with some of the wealthiest and
most highly-educated people in the
country. It is my feeling that your
diction, as charming as it may be
in the tri-state area, could use a
bit of finessing.
LIP
Like you mean diction in what way?
DR. SHIRLEY
In the only way the word “diction”
is ever used.
LIP
(unsure)
Okay...
DR. SHIRLEY
Your intonation, inflection, choice
of words-LIP
Ayyyy, I got my own problems, I
gotta worry what other people think
about the way I talk?
DR. SHIRLEY
There are simple techniques I can
teach you that are quite effective.
I can help you.

Lip is frustrated.

I don’t need no goddamn help. If
people don’t like the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.
DR. SHIRLEY
The profanity is another issue.
LIP
A fanabla, why you breakin’ my
balls?
DR. SHIRLEY
Because you can do better. And
here’s another thing--as guest of
honor, I will be announced when I
enter these intimate events. You
will be announced as well.
Vallelonga may be difficult to
pronounce. I was thinking “Valle”
would be more appropriate. Tony
Valle. It’s short and simple.
LIP
Nuh-uh. If they got a problem with
Vallelonga, they can call me Tony
Lip.
Shirley winces.
DR. SHIRLEY
These are genteel people. That might
be a little...worldly for them.
LIP
Then it’s Tony Vallelonga. All
these high-class people that are so
much smarter than me, with all
their intelligence and speakin’
abilities, you’re telling me they
can’t pronounce my name?
DR. SHIRLEY
I’m just telling you, Valle will
make things easier.
LIP
My last name is Vallelonga and I
ain’t changing it for nobody. They
don’t like it, they can shove it up
their ass--I’ll just wait outside.

room. On stage, a Steinway piano, a Cello, and a Stand-up
Bass. A distinguished-looking WOMAN, MC, 40s, steps up to the
microphone.
MC
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we
are privileged to present a great
American artist. He gave his first
public performance at the age of
three. At age eighteen, at Arthur
Fiedler's invitation, our guest
made his concert debut with the
Boston Pops. He holds Doctorates in
Psychology, in Music, and in the
Liturgical Arts, and has performed
at the White House twice in the
last fourteen months. He is a true
virtuoso.

AUDIENCE IS MESMERIZED.
ANGLE ON Lip as he steps closer to the window.
CLOSE ON DR. SHIRLEY - His hands glide over the Steinway’s
ivories like a bird in flight. Each finger is center key,
each note plucked perfectly. HE’S A VIRTUOSO AT THE PEAK OF
HIS CRAFT.

Craps and cards, I don’t lose, Doc.

like a colored guy. He plays like
Liberace but better and I ain’t
lying. He’s like a genius I think.
When I look at him in the rear-view
mirror, I can tell he’s always
thinking and working stuff out in
his head, I guess that’s what
geniuses do. But it don’t look fun

STAGE MANAGER
You’re all set up.
LIP
This ain’t the piano, right?
The STAGE MANAGER approaches. This guy’s big, Duke Wayne with
a hammer holster.
That’s it.

STAGE MANAGER

LIP
This isn’t a Steinway...?
So what?

STAGE MANAGER

LIP
Dr. Shirley only plays on
Steinway-brand pianos. It’s in his
written contract.
STAGE MANAGER
Who’s Dr. Shirley?
LIP
Dr. Shirley--the Don Shirley Trio?
STAGE MANAGER
Does it really matter?
LIP
Yes, it does. It’s in his contract.
The Stage Manager rolls his eyes.

STAGE MANAGER
Come on, what’s the difference -these coons can play on anything.
CLOSE ON OLEG AND GEORGE as they stop what they’re doing and
take notice.
BACK ON Lip as he looks closely at the filthy piano.
LIP
But there’s garbage in this thing.
STAGE MANAGER
So, take it out.
Lip stiffens.
LIP
What’d you say?
STAGE MANAGER
You heard me.
LIP
Get a clean Steinway in here.
STAGE MANAGER
There’s no Steinway on campus.
LIP
Not my problem.
STAGE MANAGER
I bet there ain’t two Steinways in
the whole state of Indiana.
LIP
Then you better move your ass and
start lookin’.
Oleg and George exchange a glance. The Stage Manager puffs up.
STAGE MANAGER
Who you think you’re talking to,
greaseball?
Without warning, Lip LASHES OUT with a BRUTAL OPEN-HAND SLAP
to the Stage Manager’s ear. The Stage Manager STAGGERS BACK
AND SIDEWAYS. He stares at Lip, dazed.

INT. INDIANA COLLEGE CAMPUS - CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
Dr. Shirley’s fingers tinkle the ivories on a Steinway,

ritzy joints. Dr. Shirley and I are
getting along pretty good, but
sometimes I think he gets depressed
and drinks too much.”
-- CLOSE ON DR. SHIRLEY PLAYING AT A HIGH-SOCIETY PARTY...
LIP (V.O.)
“I never knew how very beautiful
this country was. Now that I’m
seeing it I know. You wouldn’t
believe how beautiful nature is--it
is as beautiful as they say. I wish
I had a camera and took some
pictures, they would be collector’s
items, I wish I knew how to
describe it to you.”
-- DR. SHIRLEY’S CAR DRIVING ON VARIOUS HIGHWAYS, WITH
AMAZING VIEWS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE... SIGNS FOR NEENAH,

Shirley takes a BEAT, reluctantly opens up.

DR. SHIRLEY
I have a brother somewhere. We used
to get together once in a
while...but it got more and more
difficult to keep in touch. That’s
the curse of being a musician-you’re always on the road, like a
carnival worker, or a criminal.
(beat)
It took a toll on my marriage as
well.
Lip glances in the rear-view mirror.
LIP
You’re married?
Was.

DR. SHIRLEY

They drive for a moment.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
June was a good person--terrible
grammar, but a kind soul.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have the
constitution to do a husband act as

he drives.
LIP
This might be the best Kentucky
Fried Chicken I ever had. But I
guess it’s fresher down here,
right?
Dr. Shirley shrugs.
DR. SHIRLEY
I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone
with your appetite.
LIP
No, I bought the bucket so you
could have some.
DR. SHIRLEY
I’ve never had fried chicken in my
life.
LIP
Who you bullshittin’? You people
love the fried chicken, the grits,
the colored greens...I love it,
too. The negro cooks used to make
it when I was in the army.
DR. SHIRLEY
You have a very narrow assessment
of me, Tony.
LIP
(pleased)
Yeah, I’m good, right?
DR. SHIRLEY
What? No. No, you’re not good,
you’re bad. I’m saying, just
because other negro people listen
to a certain kind of music doesn’t
mean I have to. Nor do we all have
to eat the same food.

Whoa, wait a minute. If you said
all guineas like pizza and

You’re missing the point. For you
to make the assumption that-LIP
Doc, you want some or not?
Lip holds up the bucket.
No.

DR. SHIRLEY

Lip takes another big, juicy bite.
LIP
Tell me that don’t smell good?
DR. SHIRLEY
It smells okay, but I don’t want to
get grease on my blanket.
LIP
Oooh, I’m gonna get grease on my
blankie--have a piece. It ain’t
gonna kill ya.
Lip takes a piece of chicken, holds it out to Shirley.
LIP (CONT’D)
Just grab it and eat it!
No.

DR. SHIRLEY

Plates?
LIP
Bah fongool! Eat it with your hands,
that’s how you’re supposed to.
DR. SHIRLEY
I can’t do that.
LIP
I swear I’m gonna throw it!
Shirley reluctantly takes the chicken.
DR. SHIRLEY
I... I really can’t do this.
LIP
Eat the goddamn thing.
Shirley takes a bite. Lip can see he’s enjoying it.
LIP (CONT’D)
What, no good?
Very good.
DR. SHIRLEY
I just... this seems so... so
unsanitary.
LIP
‘Gives a shit?! Relax and enjoy it.
My father always says, whatever you
do, do it hundred percent. When you
work, work, when you laugh, laugh,
when you eat, eat like it’s your
last meal.
Shirley is clearly enjoying the chicken.
LIP (CONT’D)
Want another piece? Have a leg!
Lip hands Shirley a leg.
DR. SHIRLEY
What do we do about the bones?
LIP
We do this.

Lip throws his bones out the window. After a BEAT, Shirley
rolls down his window and does the same. They smile at one
another for the first time. Then Lip finishes his Coke and

they drive on.
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOUISVILLE MOTEL - EARLY EVENING
The Caddy pulls up in front of a RUN-DOWN MOTEL with a “FOR
COLORED ONLY” sign. Low-end, one-level on the edge of
downtown. Nothing like the upscale hotels they’ve been
staying in.
Lip behind the wheel, READING THE GREEN BOOK; Shirley in the
backseat.
LIP
This can’t be it. Says right
here...
(points to Green Book)
...cozy as your own home... This
place looks like my ass.
DR. SHIRLEY
This is the place.
The guys get out of the car. Lip takes Shirley’s bag out of

SARK.
SHIRLEY’S POV - The families are eating, drinking, enjoying
the night. CHILDREN run around, playing games, having fun.
THREE MEN are setting up a game of HORSESHOES in the yard.
One of the MEN calls to Shirley.
MAN #1
Hey, fancy-pants, you wanna play?
DR. SHIRLEY
Um... no, thank you.
MAN #2
Come on, we short a man!
Shirley shifts in his chair, uncomfortable.
DR. SHIRLEY
I... I’d rather not.
MAN #1
What, you too high and mighty?
MAN #3
He’s just afraid of getting that
butler uniform all dusty!
The men LAUGH.

Shirley drains his scotch, stands, and WALKS INTO THE NIGHT.
INT. LIP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON BEDSIDE TABLE where we see a wallet, a pack of
smokes, and, surprisingly, the JADE ROCK that we thought Lip
had returned.
PULL BACK to reveal Lip, in boxers, sitting up in bed,
flipping through the GREEN BOOK.
He puts the book aside a moment, opens a pizza box on the bed
beside him. He takes out the ENTIRE UNCUT PIZZA, FOLDS IT IN
HALF AND TAKES A BITE.

He goes back to the book. CLOSE ON the cover - Up top it

He flips through the book. CLOSE ON A PAGE - It reads:
“Assured Protection for the Negro Traveler.” Below it there’s
an ad for “Gerald’s Restaurant in Buffalo, New York Delightful Dinners for Particular People -- open 24 hours.”
Lip turns to another page. CLOSE ON PAGE - A photo of Mrs.
Ressie Harris, the owner of Quinn’s Hotel - “The most
fabulous hotel for colored.”
There’s an URGENT KNOCK ON THE DOOR.
GEORGE (O.S.)
Tony, it’s George! Wake up!

Lip gets up, opens the door. It’s George, sweating and out of
breath.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Dr. Shirley’s in trouble.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
George and Lip hustle down the street.
GEORGE
(panicked)
I went out for a drink, I walk into
this bar, and there’s Shirley
getting bounced around! I didn’t
want to leave him, but I didn’t
know what to do!
INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
A shit-hole. Drunken REDNECKS surround an EVEN DRUNKER
Shirley. LAUGHING as they shove him, smack him around.

Get your hands off him!
The Rednecks stop their fun. Bar goes quiet. They turn toward
Lip and George.

Redneck #1 tries to read Lip’s face... impossible. Lip can
stare down an army.
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Well, I sure ain’t.
ANGLE ON - THE BARKEEP, 60s, holding a shotgun, pointing it
directly at Lip and George.
BARKEEP
And I won’t be having none of this
come to pass in my place. Let the
spook go. I want these Yanks off my
property.
After a BEAT, the Rednecks reluctantly open a path for Shirley.
Shirley staggers toward Lip and collapses against him. Lip
motions for George to exit, then Lip throws Shirley over his
shoulder and backs out the door, his eyes peeled for trouble.
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOUISVILLE MOTEL - NIGHT - LATER
An irate Lip walks an inebriated Shirley throught the parking
lot of the motel.

Shirley looks at him oddly.
DR. SHIRLEY
Does the geography really matter?
What?

DR. SHIRLEY
If I walked into a bar in your

Lip dodges the question.

From now on you don’t go nowhere

Men, women, children, bent to the waist, filling woven
baskets with sweet potatoes.
Shirley steps out of the Cadillac, walks to the front of the
car where Lip is thigh-deep under the hood.
While Shirley leans on the fender, Lip walks to the trunk,
pulls out a jug of water and a rag. He goes back to the
engine, opens the hot radiator cap, pours the water in.
Dr. Shirley wipes the sweat beads off his forehead with his
suit-pocket handkerchief, looks out onto the fields.
One by one the Pickers STAND UP and STARE BACK AT HIM from
BOTH sides of the road. They’ve never seen a black man like
him before.
Lip crawls out from under the hood, wipes his hands with a

ever done.”
Eyes glued to the page, Lip SCRIBBLES AWAY FURIOUSLY.
LIP
“Falling in love with you was the
easiest thing...”
(looks up, smiling)
This is very fucking romantic.
As Lip continues writing, we go...
INT. LIP’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dolores sits on the couch reading the letter, the kids asleep
next to her... In her head, she HEARS LIP’S VOICE.
LIP (V.O.)
Nothing matters but you. I am the
luckiest man alive, and every
moment I am without you, I realize
this.
Dolores can barely believe the poetry pouring out of her
husband.
LIP (V.O.)
I loved you the day I met you, I
love you today...
Dolores is PRACTICALLY IN TEARS and we go...
BACK ON SHIRLEY AS HE FINISHES DICTATING THE WORDS.
DR. SHIRLEY
Is it okay if I say, “P.S., kiss
the kids”?
Shirley breaks from his trance.
A P.S.?

DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)

CONTINUED:
LIP
Yeah, at the end.
DR. SHIRLEY
That’s like clanging a cowbell at
the end of Shostakovich’s 7th.
Lip nods as if he knows what Shirley’s talking about.
LIP
(hopeful)
So it’s okay?
Dr. Shirley can’t say no to the child in front of him.
DR. SHIRLEY
It’s perfect, Tony.
Lip smiles and writes...
CUT TO:
EXT. MACON, GEORGIA - DAY
Lip and Shirley walk down the street. They pass by a MEN’S
CLOTHING STORE and Shirley stops to look in the window.
ANGLE ON STORE WINDOW -- a WHITE MANNEQUIN dons a high-end
British-style suit and vest.
LIP
That guy looks just like you, Doc.
He does?

DR. SHIRLEY

LIP
(realizing)
Size-wise.
Shirley studies the suit, considering it.
LIP (CONT’D)
Go in and try it on. What, you
always gotta wear a tux on stage?
Mix it up a little.
INT. MEN’S CLOTHING STORE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
As Lip and Shirley ENTER, a couple BUSINESSMEN are trying on
suits. A TAILOR approaches Lip.
TAILOR
May I help you, sir?

(CONTINUED)

LIP
We want to try on that suit in the
window.
Of course.

TAILOR

The Tailor pulls a suit off the rack, hands it to Lip.
TAILOR (CONT’D)
Dressing room’s in the back, sir.
Lip hands Shirley the suit.
DR. SHIRLEY
Thanks. I’ll just be a moment.
LIP
Take your time. I’ll check out some
ties for ya.
The Tailor REACTS, follows Shirley toward the dressing room.
TAILOR
Uh, excuse me, you’re not allowed
to try that on.
DR. SHIRLEY
I beg your pardon?
The Tailor takes the suit from him.
TAILOR
If you would like to purchase it
first, we’ll be happy to tailor it
to your needs.
Shirley stares at him a moment, gets it, and heads for the door.
ANGLE ON Lip at the tie rack, watching all this. Frustrated,
he glares at the Tailor and follows Shirley out.

Lip’s in the BATHROOM washing his socks in the sink. WE HEAR
ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS coming from the O.S. TELEVISION.
THE PHONE RINGS O.S.
Lip goes to the bed, passing the television. WE SEE black
socks hanging on the rabbit ears antenna and some underwear
drying on the vents of the TV. Lip answers the phone.
Yeah...

LIP

EXT. MACON YMCA - NIGHT
Lip enters the YMCA.
INT. MACON YMCA - POOL AREA - MOMENTS LATER
Lip approaches POLICEMAN #1 standing beside a swimming pool.
LIP
I got a call about Dr. Shirley.
Come on...

POLICEMAN #1

Lip follows the Policeman.
INT. MACON YMCA - LOCKER ROOM/STEAM ROOM - NIGHT
Policeman #1 enters the locker room followed by Lip.
Dr. Shirley, BRUISED, is handcuffed, sitting on the floor,
naked (also seen from the side). His skin still wet from the
steam room and sweat. Next to him also naked and cuffed to
the radiator, is a WHITE MAN.
Policeman #1 walks Lip over to POLICEMAN #2, African
American.
POLICEMAN #1
This is him.
LIP
Can you give the guy a towel, for
Chrissakes?
No one moves. Lip grabs a towel off a rack and throws it to
Shirley, who covers himself as best he can.
POLICEMAN #2
You a lawyer?

No.

LIP

POLICEMAN #2
Well you should call one. We’re
taking your Auntie in.
For what?

POLICEMAN #1
Manager caught him and the other
guy...
The Cop motions to the Caucasian Man in cuffs.
Lip glances over at the dazed and humiliated Shirley.
LIP
Can’t we get the cuffs off him, let
him put his pants on?
POLICEMAN #1
Sure we can. But we ain’t.
LIP
Look, we’re out of here in the
morning, you’ll never see us again.
There’s gotta be a way to work this
out.
(scrambling)
What if, uh, you let him go, and I
give you something to thank you?
BEAT.
POLICEMAN #1
You bribing us?
LIP
No, no... a thank you.
POLICEMAN #1
What kind of thank you?
LIP
Like... a donation to the police
force. To you guys. Whatever you
want.

You like suits?

I was walking through your nice
town today, I saw a store that was
selling suits. Nice suits.

The cops glance at one another.
LIP (CONT’D)
How about, as a thank you--a
donation--I buy you guys each a
suit? You get dressed up nice, take
your wives out to dinner. Guys like
you, you deserve it.
The two Policemen glance at each other.
SMASH CUT TO
EXT. MACON YMCA - NIGHT
Shirley trails Lip as they EXIT the YMCA and walk toward the
parking lot. No one speaks. Then...
DR. SHIRLEY
(subdued)
They were wrong for the way they
treated me, and you rewarded them.
We see that Shirley’s eye is bruised, his lip slightly
swollen.
LIP
I was hired to make sure you get
from one show to the next. How I do
it shouldn’t matter to you.
DR. SHIRLEY
I just wish you hadn’t paid them
off.
LIP
I did what I had to do. You know,
if this got out it would kill your
career.
DR. SHIRLEY
Okay, Tony, quit your phony
altruism and concern for my career.
LIP
What the hell does that mean?

(CONTINUED)

75.
CONTINUED:
DR. SHIRLEY
You were only thinking about
yourself back there, because you
know if I miss a show, it comes out
of your pocket.
LIP
Of course I don’t want you to miss
a show, you ungrateful bastard! You
think I’m doing this for my
health?! Tonight I saved your ass,
so show a little appreciation.
Besides, I told you never to go
nowhere without me!
DR. SHIRLEY
(calmly)
I assumed you would want this to be
the exception.
Lip gets in the car without opening Shirley’s door. Shirley
stands alone a moment, then opens his own door.

Lip gets out of the car, opens Shirley’s door.

MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)

Lip turns to see TWO NEW YORK WISEGUYS standing out front
waiting for their car. The mouth of the group is pug-nosed
DOMINIC.
LIP
Dominic. The hell you doin’ here?
WISEGUY #1
Brooklyn sent us down to take care
of a few things.
He glances at Shirley, who’s waiting by the hotel entrance.
DOMINIC

Who’s the eggplant?
CLOSE ON - Shirley, waiting for Lip by the hotel entrance.
LIP (O.S.)

I’m working for him.
BACK TO LIP AND DOMINIC.
DOMINIC

What’d you lose a bet?
One of the wiseguys LAUGHS.
DOMINIC (CONT’D)
(in Italian)
What’s wrong with you? You need
work, you come to me! I’ll always
find work for you. Matter of fact, I
can use you this week. Gotta hit a

Lip comes out of his room, locks his door.

Lip turns to see Shirley behind him in the hallway.
LIP
Oh. Hey. Just... downstairs. For a

DR. SHIRLEY

Lip is taken aback.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
(in Italian)
Before you decide whether or not to
take him up on the job offer, I
think we should have a word.
Lip realizes that Shirley understood the earlier conversation.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
(in English)
Tony, I think you’re doing a
wonderful job.
Lip shrugs, not used to Shirley being so solicitous.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
So I would like to formally offer
you the position of my road
manager. With the title comes more
responsibility and, of course,
there will be a raise in pay.
Lip thinks about it.
LIP
No, thanks.
Shirley nods, disappointed.
LIP (CONT’D)
You and me, we agreed on a hundred
and twenty-five a week, plus
expenses. That’s our deal. I ain’t
goin’ nowhere, Doc. I’m just goin’
down to tell ‘em.
A surprised Shirley watches Lip walk to the stairway.

world.
As Lip heads downstairs, WE PUSH IN on Shirley.
CUT TO:
INT. PEABODY HOTEL - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT
Dr. Shirley and Lip sit at a table in the lobby. Shirley
pours them both a drink from a bottle of Cutty Sark.
LIP
So, how’d you learn how to play so
good, Doc?
DR. SHIRLEY
My mother. She taught me how to
play on an old spinet. Soon as I
could walk, we’d travel around the
Florida panhandle and I’d put on
little shows in parishes and halls.
A man who had seen me play arranged
for me to study at the Leningrad
Conservatory of Music.
LIP
So that’s where they taught you all
them songs you play?
DR. SHIRLEY
Actually, I was trained to play
classical music. Brahms, Franz
Liszt, Chopin--it’s all I ever
wanted to play.
(smile fades)
But I was persuaded by my record
company to pursue a career in
popular music instead. They told me
audiences would never accept a
black pianist on the classical
stage. Wanted to turn me into just
another “colored entertainer.” You
know, the guy who smokes while he’s
playing, who puts a glass of whisky
on the piano and then gets mad when
he’s not respected like Arthur
Rubinstein. Well, you don’t see
Arthur Rubenstein smoking and
putting a drink on his piano.

(CONTINUED)

80.
CONTINUED:
LIP
Personally, if you stuck to that
classic stuff I think it would’ve
been a big mistake.
DR. SHIRLEY
A mistake? Performing the music I
trained my entire life to play?
LIP
Trained? What are you, a seal?
Anyone can sound like Beethoven or
Joe Pan or them other guys you
said. But your music, what you do,
only you can do, and nobody can
train for that.
Shirley thinks about this.
DR. SHIRLEY
Thank you, Tony.
(beat)
But...not everyone can play
Chopin...not the way I can.

A car pulls up next to them. The COUPLE inside, 30s, start to

Shirley keeps walking. Lip catches up, grabs his arm. Shirley
turns, his face drenched...

DR. SHIRLEY
Yes, I live in a castle! Alone. And
rich white folks let me play piano
for them, because it makes them
feel cultured. But when I walk off
that stage I go right back to being
another nigger to them--because
that is their true culture. And I
suffer that slight alone, because
I’m not accepted by my own people,
because I’m not like them either!
So if I’m not black enough, and I’m
not white enough, and I’m not man
enough, what am I?!
Tony doesn’t know what to say. They stand in the rain while
Shirley tries to compose himself. Lip awkwardly touches
Shirley’s shoulder. Shirley turns and walks back to the car,
leaving Tony standing alone in the downpour.
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT - LATER
Back on the road, both of them disheveled and wiped out from
the evening. Nobody speaks for a while.
DR. SHIRLEY
I need sleep.
LIP
Okay, I’ll pull over at the next
place we see and I’ll sneak you
into my room.
DR. SHIRLEY
No. No. I refuse to stay at an
establishment that doesn’t want me.
Okay.

Lip picks up the Negro Moterist Green book from the seat next

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
Lip lays in a sunken twin bed in his t-shirt and underwear
WRITING A LETTER. Shirley, in silk pajamas, folds his clothes
and places them into his suitcase.
DR. SHIRLEY
You realize you’re going to be home
before that letter gets there?
LIP
Yeah, I was gonna just bring it
with me. Save on stamps.
Shirley rolls his eyes.
DR. SHIRLEY
Give it here, I’ll fix it.
Shirley reaches for the letter, but Lip pulls it away.
LIP
No offense, Doc, but I think I got
the hang of it.
For a moment, Shirley’s offended. Then he SNATCHES THE LETTER
out of Lip’s hand.
DR. SHIRLEY
(reading)
“Dear Dolores, sometimes you remind
me of a house.”
Shirley glances at Lip... what the hell?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
(reading)
”A house with beautiful lights on
it where everyone inside is happy.”
Shirley hands the letter back to Lip.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Yeah, you got it.
Shirley gets in bed, tries to sleep. We hear O.S. cars;
occasionally a dog barks in the distance.
Doc...
Yes?

LIP
DR. SHIRLEY

LIP
Thanks for helping me with the
letters--you’re really good at
writin’ ‘em.
(beat)
Maybe when you get home you should
write one to your brother?
DR. SHIRLEY
He knows where I am if he wants to
reconnect.
Lip nods. He puts his letter down, turns out the light.
LIP
Don’t wait for him, Doc. This I
know...the world’s full of lonely
people afraid to make the first
move.
Shirley thinks about this, then rolls over.
LIP (CONT’D)
You know, something’s been eating
at me the whole trip.
Hmmm?

DR. SHIRLEY

LIP
That Tittsburgh was a real
disappointment. I didn’t notice any
difference at all.
DR. SHIRLEY
Good night, Tony.

THE CADDY PULLS UP FRONT AND PARKS.
Lip and Shirley get out. Waiting for them is GRAHAM KINDELL,
40s, blue blazer, pressed slacks, friendly as hell.
GRAHAM KINDELL
(deep southern accent)
Welcome, Mr. Shirley! Graham
Kindell, I’m the general manager.
So nice to meet y’all!
DR. SHIRLEY
Thank you, Mr. Kindell. This is
Tony Vallelonga.
GRAHAM KINDELL
Pleasure, Tony. Right this way.
INT. BIRMINGHAM HOTEL - KITCHEN/DRESSING ROOM - EVENING
Lip and Shirley (carrying his tux) follow the affable Kindell
through the large working kitchen. COOKS, BUSBOYS,
DISHWASHERS, ALL BLACK. They continue down several busy
hallways to a backstage dressing room.
GRAHAM KINDELL
If you need anything--anything
t’all--you let me know.
Thank you.

DR. SHIRLEY

INT. BIRMINGHAM HOTEL - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kindell leads Shirley and Lip into the modest room. A small
table, one chair, a mirror.
GRAHAM KINDELL

LIP
Where’s the restaurant?
GRAHAM KINDELL
Continue down the hall, Tony, to
the right, across the lobby.

Kindell EXITS.
LIP
We’ve got an hour. I’m starving.
DR. SHIRLEY
Go ahead. I’ll meet you there.
INT. BIRMINGHAM HOTEL - DINING ROOM / CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
A cavernous DINING ROOM/HALL. Ornately decorated in red and
green ribbons and wreaths. A twenty-foot Christmas Tree
towers behind the Trio’s instruments onstage. Filling in fast
with well-dressed WHITE CUSTOMERS.
Lip ENTERS, sits at a table.
HIS POV - Across the room, Oleg and George eat dinner, drink
wine. George CALLS OUT:
Tony!

GEORGE

George waves him over. Lip joins them.
LIP
Shirley’ll be here in a minute.
A WAITER approaches.
BIRMINGHAM WAITER
Cocktails, gentlemen?
OLEG
Three shots vodka.
Tony looks at Oleg.
OLEG (CONT’D)
Last show. Cold war over. Time for
truce.
Lip nods, smiles. The Waiter leaves to get the drinks.
GEORGE
Is Shirley in his dressing room?
LIP
More like a broom closet. I don’t
understand why he puts up with this
shit.
Oleg takes a sip of wine, glances at George.

OLEG
Six years ago, 1956, Nat King Cole
was invited to perform at Municipal
Auditorium right here in
Birmingham. Mr. Cole was very first
negro asked to play at a white
establishment in this city.
Lip butters a roll, takes a bite.
OLEG (CONT’D)
Soon as Mr. Cole started playing, a
group of men attacked him for
playing white people’s music.
Pulled him off stage and beat him
badly.
Lip stops chewing.
OLEG (CONT’D)
You asked once why Dr. Shirley does
this? I tell you. Because there is
no genius without courage.
The Waiter returns with the drinks. They CLINK glasses, down
the shots.
Lip NOTICES Shirley (now in his tux) and the MAITRE D’ having
a conversation at the entrance. Lip walks over.
LIP
What’s the problem?
DR. SHIRLEY
This gentleman’s saying I can’t
dine here.
LIP
(to Maitre D’)
No, you don’t understand, this
guy’s playing here tonight--he’s
the main event.
MAITRE D’
I’m sorry. It’s the policy of the
restaurant.
Graham Kindell, the congenial GM, joins them.
GRAHAM KINDELL
Everything all right?

LIP
No, it’s not all right. Dr.
Shirley’s being told he can’t eat
here.
GRAHAM KINDELL
(to Shirley)
I apologize, but these are... longstanding traditions. I’m sure you
understand.
DR. SHIRLEY
No. I don’t. In 45 minutes I’ll be
entertaining your guests up on that
stage, but I can’t eat here?
Graham Kindell shifts uncomfortably.
LIP
Wait a minute. You’re tellin’ me
the bozos in his band, and the
shlubs that came to see him play
can eat here, but the star can’t?
Customers take notice. It’s getting embarrassing.
GRAHAM KINDELL
I’m afraid not.
Lip looks to the stoic Shirley, then back to Kindell,
searching for a compromise.
LIP
Well he’s gotta eat. Can you at
least bring him food from the
restaurant to his dressing room?
GRAHAM KINDELL
Of course. We’ll be happy to send
him anything he would like.
(to Maitre D’)
John, show him a menu.
DR. SHIRLEY
No. I’m not eating in a dressing
room.
There’s a brief standoff.

GRAHAM KINDELL
Okay... if you’d prefer, there’s a
very popular establishment right
down the road--the Orange Bird-they’ll be happy to feed you.
Lip turns to Shirley.
LIP
Food’s probably better there anyway
--the dinner rolls here are like
rocks. Come on, we can be back in
45 minutes.
When Shirley doesn’t respond, Lip pulls him aside.
LIP (CONT’D)
Doc, it’s the last show. Let’s just
get through this and we can go home
and get away from all these
assholes.
Dr. Shirley thinks about it.
DR. SHIRLEY
No. Not this time. I’m eating in
this room or I’m not playing.
Kindell’s frustration grows.
GRAHAM KINDELL
(to Lip)
May I have a word with you?
Lip follows Kindell through a door, into a side parlor.
INT. BIRMINGHAM HOTEL - RESTAURANT - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
Kindell tries to pour on the Southern charm.
GRAHAM KINDELL
Mr. Villanueva, you have to talk
sense to Mr. Shirley. Please
explain that we’re not insulting
him personally, this is just the
way things are done down here.
LIP
Yeah, well he ain’t from down here.

GRAHAM KINDELL
Just ask him to be reasonable. I
have 400 guests out there who
expect to be entertained tonight.
LIP
And Dr. Shirley expects to eat
tonight. Why can’t you just make an
exception this one time?
Kindell SIGHS.
GRAHAM KINDELL
Lemme tell you a story. You ever
hear of the Boston Celtics
basketball club? Those boys came
through here a couple years ago on
a barnstorming tour. Now, seeing as
they were World Champions of the
league and all, we was tickled to
have ‘em eat here and we rolled out
the welcome wagon. So you know what
table their big coon ate at that
night?
No.

LIP

GRAHAM KINDELL
I don’t either. But it wasn’t one
of ours.
Kindell drops the genteel demeanor.
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D)
Now let’s cut the bullshit. Tell me
what it’s gonn’ take.
Kindell takes out his wallet.
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D)
Say one hundred dollars and you get
your boy to play?
The veins on Lip’s neck rise.
LIP
You think you can buy me?
GRAHAM KINDELL
All do respect, sir, but you
wouldn’t be doing a job like this
if you couldn’t be bought.

Lip GRABS Kindell by the collar, raises a fist.
Stop!

DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.)

They turn to see Shirley in the doorway. Graham Kindell pulls
away from Lip, fixes his collar.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
It’s all right, Tony. I’ll play...
if you want me to.
Graham Kindell SIGHS, clearly relieved. Lip is relieved, too.
But only for a moment. Something comes over him. He glances
at Kindell, then back at Shirley. Lip finally sees the big
picture, and realizes that, for him and Shirley, this is the
moment of truth. Then...
LIP
Nah, let’s get the fuck outta here.

Lip escorts Shirley through the crowded ballroom toward the

surprised and bewildered crowd.
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D)
We have a contract, and I know
you’re the kind of man that honors

ANGLE ON the BLACK SERVERS watching their boss grovel. They
maintain deadpan expressions, but we can see the APPROVAL IN
THEIR EYES.

Scattered BOOS and CATCALLS from the diners as the FURIOUS
Graham Kindell follows them out the front door...

This is a Blues Bar/Restaurant. Lip and Shirley ENTER. A
small BAND in the corner--piano, drums and guitar--plays the
BLUES. Lip’s the only white guy in here and he doesn’t go
unnoticed, especially standing next to Shirley in a tuxedo.
They make their way to the bar, sit. A female BARTENDER gives
Lip the once-over.
You a cop?

ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER

LIP
I look Irish?
She smirks.
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
What you want, baby?
DR. SHIRLEY
Two Cutty’s, neat.
Shirley takes out a BIG WAD OF CASH. A couple DRUNKS at the
bar take notice.
Comin’ up.

ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER

She grabs a bottle of Cutty, pours the drinks.
DR. SHIRLEY
Whatever your specialty is, we’ll
take it.
She CALLS back toward the kitchen:
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
Two orange birds!

SAME SCENE - LATER
Lip and Shirley are devouring two barbecue chickens, their
hands and faces covered in orange sauce.
LIP
I like what you did back there,
Doc. You stood up for yourself.
It’s like your friend the President
says -- “Don’t ask what your
country can do for you, ask what
you can do for yourself.”
Shirley smiles. The Bartender approaches.
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
(to Shirley)
So, darlin’, what you do, all
dressed up like that?
He shrugs.
DR. SHIRLEY
Nothing important.
LIP
He’s only the greatest piano player
in the world.
She smiles.
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
That right? You good?
LIP
Don’t be shy, Doc. Tell her who you
are.
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER
Don’t tell me nothin’--show me.
Shirley thinks a moment, glances at the BEAT-UP PIANO. He
gets up, walks to the stage, sits at the piano. He notices a
drink on the top of the piano. Shirley takes the drink, puts
it on the floor.
SHIRLEY PLACES HIS HANDS ON THE KEYS, TAKES A MOMENT...
And then... Shirley starts to play. This isn’t a catchy jazz
solo or a Christmas ditty. It is, instead, an explosion of
sound, the eye-popping machinations of Chopin’s Etude Op. 25
No. 11, one of the most difficult piano solos ever written.
The crowd lower their forks and gaze up in disbelief.

Black kitchen workers stop what they’re doing to watch. A
COOK steps out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on his apron.
BACK ON SHIRLEY as he negotiates the eight-finger chord
combinations with the mastery of the maestro that he is.
He builds and builds and builds until his fingers become JUST
A BLUR ON THE KEYS.
Shirley FINISHES, the room is quiet.
Then the place ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE!
CLOSE ON Lip. He’s as blown away as the audience.
Shirley looks toward a stunned Lip and winks.
The GUITAR PLAYER, DRUMMER, and SAX join Shirley on the
stage. They start a cool up tempo rockin’ blues number.
Shirley effortlessly joins in, taking the music to another
level. The entire room begins to PULSATE. The crowd eats it
up.
Shirley plays as if Little Richard had taken over his body.
Obviously this man can play anything. A true musical genius.
ANGLE ON Lip as he looks on, really getting into it.
BACK ON SHIRLEY, the happiest we’ve seen him.

Dr. Shirley thinks, then SNAPS his fingers.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Why don’t you put your lucky rock
up on the dash, Tony?
Lip stares at him in the mirror for a LONG BEAT. Finally, he
reaches in his pocket, pulls out the JADE STONE THAT WE
THOUGHT HE HAD RETURNED, places it on the dash.

Frank “Tony Lip” Vallelonga went back to his job at the
Copacabana, eventually becoming Maitre’ D, until its closing
in 1973.
It was at the Copa where he met Francis Ford Coppola, who
cast him in a small role in The Godfather. This led to an
impressive acting career, including roles in Raging Bull, The
Pope Of Greenwich Village, Donnie Brasco, and Goodfellas.
Lip is best known for his portrayal of New York crime boss
Carmine Lupertazzi in the HBO series The Sopranos.
Tony Lip and Dr. Shirley would remain lifelong friends until
their deaths within months of each other in 2013.
