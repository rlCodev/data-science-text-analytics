EXT. RIVERBOAT CASINO PARKING LOT - IOWA - NIGHT

1

Outrageous flashing lights sparkle in the reflection of the
windshield of a 2003 Subaru station wagon. Slumped behind the
wheel is GERRY KARTWELL (early-40s, mustached). He listens to
Joe Navarro’s audio book of “200 Poker Tells” on CD.
JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE
Ninety-eight. Furrowing of Forehead.
Furrowing of the forehead is a good
indicator that something is amiss or
the person is insecure. It is also
seen when people are concentrating or
trying to make sense of something.
CLOSE ON Gerry, glassy-eyed, perhaps fighting back tears.
JOE NAVARRO’S VOICE (CONT’D)
It is usually associated with doubt,
weakness, or concern.
Gerry looks in his rearview mirror, contorts and relaxes his
face in a tension-releasing exercise. He does this several
times, until he’s ready.

Hey Chuck.

Gerry nods and Chuck slides over a stack of chips.
Also seated at the table are-- CLIFFORD HOUSTON (40s, wearing a
visor and goatee, with a permanent cranky scowl).

CLIFFORD
Yeah, well, it’s just poker, baby.
How’s that? You like that one?
We ZOOM past Gerry at the table to reveal the bearded drifter
approaching in the background.
This man is CURTIS VONN (30s, handsome with a devil-may-care
attitude). We reverse ZOOM back to Gerry at the table, where
the conversation continues...

Let’s play

Chuck dishes out the next hand; everyone peeks at their cards.
CURTIS (CONT’D)
Aces are good, right?
Curtis smiles, bets a stack of chips. Most players fold. Not
Gerry. He raises. Without missing a beat, Curtis meets Gerry’s
raise.
When the flop comes down with an Ace, the one other remaining
player folds. But Gerry looks quietly at the still-smiling
Curtis and calls bullshit, raising him once again.
Curtis looks Gerry over, zeroing in on a MISSING BUTTON ON
GERRY’S SHIRT. (It’s an odd detail to focus on in a moment like
this, but that’s the kind of guy Curtis is.) He mucks his
cards, and Gerry reels in the pot.
Aces, huh?

CLIFFORD

CURTIS
Why would I fold Aces?
MINUTES LATER.

A waitress comes by.

him when he was up in Detroit.
LARRY

The bet comes around to Curtis, who nonchalantly bets a large
stack of chips. The next two players fold.

Roundtree up in Detroit.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
He loved to play poker, but he kept
dodging my invitations to play in the
casinos. Story goes like this...
ON GERRY scrutinizing Curtis for a tell...
CLOSE ON CURTIS’ details as he continues with the story: hand
gestures, smile, hazel eyes... he shows no signs of stress.
Gerry folds his hand, and Curtis rakes in the pot.
CURTIS (CONT’D)
Apparently Tony had a little bit of a
gambling problem before I met him. You
guys know about the disassociated
persons list? Not sure you have it in
Iowa. But some states you can put
yourself on this list if you’re trying
to quit gambling. Which means you are
legally banned from all casinos in the
state.
For life.

CLIFFORD

CURTIS
For life. So you know what I’m talking
about. It makes sense, right? Well,
not to Tony. He put himself on the
list to show his girlfriend he was
serious about changing his ways. Of
course, a few months go by and she
dumps him for a guitar player.
KATE
It’s always a guitar player.
CURTIS
It is always a guitar player, isn’t it?
LARRY
Why is that?
Nice hands.

KATE

CURTIS
So he’s lonely and depressed and gets
the itch to play poker again. Walks to
the MGM-- “Sorry buddy.” Greektown-“no can do, amigo.” Motor City-- “no
dice, pal.” So what does he do?
Disguise.

poker room, and he’s in heaven. What a

back in action, and-The waitress returns with a tray of drinks.

Curtis transitions back into story mode.
CURTIS
He’s at the table for a couple hours,
playing the best poker of his life. Up
four, five thousand, when some guy’s
straight flush beats another guy’s four
cowboys.

Everyone at the table knows what this means and laughs.
Jackpot!

LARRY

CURTIS
Hundred fifty thousand dollar bad beat
jackpot. To be split between all five
players at the table.
CLIFFORD
Thirty grand a piece.
CURTIS
Thirty grand a piece. Unless you
happen to be a disassociated person who
is breaking the law by just being in
the room. So while everyone else is
high-fiving and back-slapping, Tony
jumps up, leaves his chips on the
table, and makes a bee-line for the
nearest exit... And he hasn’t stepped
foot inside a casino since.
Curtis sips his bourbon.

also knew that he didn’t know he had me
beat by the way he was betting. I had
four or five already on the line, so I
figure, what the hell, and I push the
rest of my chips in. He sits there for
five minutes. Just staring at me. So
I say “Tell ya what. For fifty bucks,

Archie owed every poker player in town
at least a few hundred bucks. Got to
the point where he was asking his
little nephews for the change in their
piggy banks. One day he’s in the poker
room at Harrah’s. I walk over to say
hello, notice he’s got a handsome pile
of chips, over five grand. Archie
starts bragging that he started the
night with just sixty bucks-- sixty
bucks he borrowed from some new chump,
by the way. So I pull him aside, tell
him he should cash out now. He’s got
enough there to pay back everyone he
owes and still get a slab at Oklahoma
Joe’s. “You’re right, you’re right,” he
tells me. “I’ll stop as soon as the
blind comes around.” I smile, walk
over to my table thinking I’d done a
good deed... Next thing I hear is
Archie’s high-pitched voice saying...
“I’m all in!”
GERRY
And then he lost it all.
CURTIS
Of course he lost it all. But you know
what he says to me? “Don’t worry. It
was only sixty bucks.”
GERRY
Some guys are just born to lose.

Gerry, holding two spades (the King and Four) has a pair of
