INT. UNCLE WONG’S CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

1

LANEY BROOKS(mid-30’s) is having a drink at the bar while she
fiddles with a pair of chopsticks. She’s pretty, but not in
the way that inspires envy; she’s pretty in a way that makes
you want to be her friend. Two large bags of takeout are on
the counter.
Laney leans over the bar looking for something but comes up
short. She pulls the elastic hair tie out of her pony tail
and ties up the chopsticks with a folded piece of paper in
the middle. She stands, drains her drink and glances over to
a MOM and DAD arguing. Their young SON has a chopstick in
each hand. He’s trying to eat his noodles but they keep
sliding off the chopsticks. The Mom and Dad don’t seem to
notice.
Laney grabs the takeout bags and starts heading for the door
but stops short at the boy’s table. She puts down her bags
and we see what she’s been making: a set of trainer
chopsticks.
LANEY
Here you go Buddy.
She quickly shows the little boy how to work them. The Mom
and Dad stop arguing and look at her. Laney’s friendly.
LANEY (CONT’D)
I still use these.
Laney heads to the door. But she doesn’t leave. Instead she
waits until the little boy captures a mess of noodles and
brings it to his mouth. Success! He looks up, locks eyes
with Laney and smiles at her. Laney smiles back, then exits.

A perfect winter day, not a cloud in the sky. DONNY (mid30s), tan and good looking is leaning against his Maserati
and smoking a joint. Laney approaches, take-out bags in
hand.
LANEY
Sorry that took so long.

No sweat.

Laney attempts to put the bags in the back seat but Donny
wraps his arm around her waist from behind, spins her around
and pins her against the side of the car, kisses her neck.

LANEY
Quick: three reasons you love me.
Donny takes another hit off the joint and passes it to her.
One--

DONNY

Laney makes a game show buzzer sound.
LANEY
--Too slow.
DONNY
--Because you’re beautiful.
He exhales.

She takes a hit off the joint.

Two- fun.

DONNY (CONT’D)

LANEY
Really fun.
DONNY
Three- smart.
Laney laughs. Donny reclaims the joint and takes another hit.
He leans in for another kiss but she dodges him.
LANEY
We’ve got hungry kids.

Come on.

Donny takes one last hit before putting the joint out with
his shoe.

EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - DAY - SAME

Tall trees line the road. Stables. Painted fences. Donny
turns by the clock tower and then comes to a stop sign on the
corner. Laney is sucking on a Red Charms Lollipop. This is
something she does throughout the movie.

EXT. LANEY BROOKS’ DRIVEWAY - DAY - SAME

Donny pulls slightly erratically into the driveway, swerving
to avoid hitting a bicycle carelessly left laying on its
side. The home is a modest center hall colonial, black
shutters, red door.

LANEY
I’ve told Eli a hundred times not
to leave his bike in the middle of
the driveway.
Donny pushes the gears into neutral, pulls on the emergency
break. Laney gets out of the car and grabs a bag of take-out
from the back seat. She’s still working on her lollipop.
LANEY (CONT’D)
The kids must be starving.
She walks toward the front door, turns around and tosses her
hair over her shoulder, tucks a piece behind her ear. She’s
undeniably sexy. She motions for Donny to get moving but he
doesn’t. Instead he sinks back into his seat, cocks his head
to the side lustily and grins at her. Laney walks back to
the car, grabs the second bag of take-out.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Come on Donny. Everyone’s waiting
for us.
He turns off the engine.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Do I look high?
Laney fumbles around in her purse. She finds the Visine and
puts a couple of drops in each eye. She’s a pro.
DONNY
You look beautiful.
Donny tries to pin Laney against the wall next to the front
door to kiss her but she wiggles out of it. Flashes a smile.
Tosses what’s left of the lollipop into the bushes.

LANEY
We’re back! Who’s hungry?
Through the french doors we see BRUCE and SUSAN (both mid30’s). Three kids, ELI (8), JANEY (6) and HENRY (8) are
playing happily on the trampoline. Donny starts removing food
from the bags. Laney heads outside.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Bruce and Susan are bundled up and watching the KIDS play.
Hearing the door open, Bruce turns around to see Laney. He
has a vaguely suspicious look on his face - is that always
there?
BRUCE
What took you so long?
Laney wraps her arms around Bruce’s neck and gives him a
kiss.
LANEY
They forgot the Moo-Shu Pork and I
know it’s your favorite.
She is well versed in identifying a suspicious look. Even
more so in knowing how to dismiss it with a kiss.
BRUCE
Food’s here! Everybody inside!
Susan, you hungry?

INT. KITCHEN TABLE - DAY - SAME

8

Bruce, Laney, Donny and Susan are sitting around the kitchen
table eating. There are open boxes of Chinese food and a few
open beer bottles on the table. The KIDS are milling around
the kitchen. Eli, in head-to-toe Nike sweats looks like a
mini version of his father. He’s dribbling a basketball.
Susan passes Donny a manuscript.
SUSAN
Bruce’s book.
Donny rests his chopsticks on his plate and takes a look at
the book.
DONNY
“Life Insurance: Hedging Your Bet
Against God”, by Bruce Brooks!
That’s a great fucking title.
SUSAN
And he just won a big insurance
award. Right Bruce?
BRUCE (TO ELI)
Not in the house E.
I know.

ELI

Eli dribbles it one last time then hugs it with one arm,
grabs a plate.
BRUCE
Man Of The Year. Highest producer
in the company.
Bruce’s tone is playful.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
They’re honoring me at the annual
convention. An all expenses paid
weekend in... Lake George. (a beat)
In March.
Everyone laughs.
DONNY (FOOD IN MOUTH)
So what’s the book about?
BRUCE
The way I see it, there’s a bible
for the afterlife. I wrote the
bible for the here and now.
More laughs.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
I’m not kidding. People can say
what they want about insurance and
guys like me but you know what? At
the end of the day, having good
insurance is the most important
thing you can do while you’re
alive. And every time you up it
you’re just hedging your bet
against God. Am I right?
Laney, bored, brings her plate into the kitchen, dumps it,
grabs a lollipop.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
(mouthful of food)
What are you doing?
LANEY
Just cleaning up, kids have school
tomorrow. I have to do laundry,
make their lunches.
BRUCE
Sit back down Laney. Everyone here
is enjoying the food.

Pink (03/02/2014)

LANEY
The ribs are sour.
BRUCE
You don’t eat.
DONNY
Come on Lane. Sit back down.
Bruce’s vaguely suspicious looks returns when Donny calls her
“Lane”. Janey enters the kitchen holding BINGO, the cutest
little dog in the entire world. Janey is Laney’s clone.
Brown hair, chocolate eyes, big smile.
JANEY
Daddy, Bingo was crying.
LANEY
Janey where did you get that dog?
JANEY
We rescued him from the pound!
BRUCE
Janey, Bingo was supposed to be a
surprise for Mommy.
JANEY
But he was crying. I think he needs
you Mommy.
Janey passes Bingo into Laney’s arms.
LANEY
Bruce, I thought we talked about
this.
BRUCE
Janey, go tell everyone to come see
Bingo.
Janey hesitates, then runs out of the room. Bruce turns to
Laney.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
No YOU talked about this. WE didn’t
talk about anything. Come on Lanethis dog is gonna make you happy.
Let's just give it a try. Can you
just trust me on this?
LANEY
Fuck you Bruce.

Pink (03/02/2014)

She shoves the dog into Bruce’s arms and exits leaving Bruce,
Donny and Susan in an awkward silence.

INT. LANEY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME

9

A naked Laney is examining herself in the bathroom mirror.
She traces her left breast with her finger. Up and around,
down. She stops, glances at herself and then lifts her right
breast. Up and around, down.
She moves closer, and begins inspecting her face. The
wrinkles by her eyes. The smile lines around her mouth.
Next to her a jar of rubbing alcohol rests on a lavender hand
towel. She opens the jar, dips the tweezers into the liquid
and then removes it.
She locates a hair hiding in the crease of her upper thigh
and pushes her thumbs together to loosen it. She takes the
tweezers, turns the sharp point in the direction of her skin
and digs. She wipes the hair onto the hand towel and
continues. Her movements are slow and deliberate. The
outcome seems to satisfy her.
Laney walks over to the sink. She rummages through the
cabinet beneath it, takes out a box of Tampax. Laney grabs a
small white envelope from inside. This is obviously where she
keeps her stash. She empties the contents onto the back of
her iPhone but not before glancing at a picture of her kids.
She sniffs a line, throws her head back and breathes deep.
Laney snorts the remaining line. She turns on the bath water,
tests it with her toes. Then she walks over to the window.

EXT. BASKETBALL HOOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Bruce is playing basketball in the driveway. Sweat drips down
his cheek, beads up on his forehead. He’s got some nice moves
- no stranger to a good pickup game in the park. Eli and
Janey are also on the court. Bruce teaches Eli how to shoot
free throws. Janey is riding a pink bicycle with training
wheels.

Eli gets into bed. His movements are slow. Deliberate. Once
in bed he focuses on the Styrofoam solar system that hangs on
the ceiling above him. Laney knocks. She cracks the door
open. She’s in her robe and holding Bingo.
HeyHey-

LANEY
ELI

She puts Bingo on his bed.
ELI (CONT’D)
Hey, Bingo.
Sleepy?

LANEY

ELI
Not really.
Eli is focused on his ceiling. Laney lays down next to him.
Bingo is between them. Laney’s sniffling, fidgety.
LANEY
Whatchya thinkin’ about?
ELI
Why do you hate Bingo?
LANEY
(irritated)
I don’t hate Bingo.
ELI
Can we keep him then?
LANEY
I don’t know E. It’s just, you
know. It’s one more thing to worry
about.
ELI
(pause)
Do you worry about me?
Laney is too amped up to finish the conversation and misses
Eli’s ultimate question.
LANEY
Okay, time to close your eyes.

Pink (03/02/2014)

She gives Eli a kiss on his forehead, grabs Bingo and heads
to the door.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Tell me when to stop...
She slowly closes the door.
Now?

LANEY (CONT’D)

ELI
A little more..
Now?

LANEY

ELI
Are we going to keep Bingo, Mom?
Maybe.

LANEY

She closes the door a little bit more.
Now?

LANEY (CONT’D)

ELI
Maybe yes or maybe no?
LANEY
Maybe as in it’s time to go to
sleep.
Laney closes the door a tiny bit more. Bingo is licking her
cheek.
ELI
So that means yes right?
going to keep Bingo?

We are

The smile on Eli’s face is hard to resist.
LANEY
It’s a definite maybe.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Laney opens her eyes, lifts her head lazily and glances at
Bruce's empty side of the bed and the clock on his night
stand. 6:55am.

Head back on the pillow, she stretches and enjoys her last
moments in the warm womb of her blankets. The bathroom door
opens.
BRUCE
Thought I was gonna have to wake
you up.
He adjusts his tie and collar, grabs his jacket.
LANEY
I don't want to get up. Get back in
bed with me.
Laney pats the pillow and smiles. Bruce gives her a kiss on
the forehead.
I wish.

BRUCE

Bruce leaves, Laney rolls over and glances at the framed
family picture on her night stand. Bruce with a younger Eli
on his shoulders, his arm around Laney who's holding an
infant Janey in her arms.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Laney is brushing her teeth. She looks up at her reflection,
then opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a prescription
bottle. As she spits out the toothpaste, she hears Bruce's
car pull out of the driveway. She looks at the prescription
and then returns it to the shelf.
14

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
Laney pulls into the school parking lot and is immediately
met by a school GUARD who is directing traffic.
GUARD
Only school buses allowed in here
lady.
LANEY
Since when?
GUARD
You must not read your emails.
ELI

LANEY
Don’t worry E.
(To guard, flirting)
Is Frank here? He always lets me
double park.
The guard has already heard this 10 times this morning, but
Laney’s charm seems to be working.
GUARD
If I could do it for anyone I’d do
it for you but the Board of Ed has
new security procedures. Recent
tragedies and all.
He hands her a sheet of paper titled “Ridgemont Elementary
School’s New Security Policy”. In smaller font it says, “In
light of recent events...”
ELI
What’s it say Mom?
LANEY
Says we have to park.
Laney pulls her SUV back out into the sea of anonymous SUVs.
She’s just another broad in suburbia.

Laney, Eli and Janey run toward the school building. They
don’t want to be late. Eli’s backpack is twice his size.
Janey’s is pink with a princess on it.
16

INT. SCHOOL OFFICE -DAY - CONTINUOUS

16

Laney, Eli and Janey are waiting in a shallow line in the
office. Laney spots Susan and her son HENRY. Susan is proudly
wearing an official looking laminate around her neck.
LANEY
Hey Susan. What’s this?
SUSAN
It’s the parent ID.

Pink (03/02/2014)

12.

Laney doesn’t register what Susan is talking about, Susan
sees this.
SUSAN (CONT’D)
They sent them in the mail? Part of
this whole new security thing.
I, uh...

LANEY

SUSAN
Don’t worry, I’ll vouch for you.
Laney fidgets, looks around, everyone is wearing a badge
around their neck. Everyone but Laney. This appears to
bother her much more than it should. She steps to the front
of the line where she is met by MRS. KOSINSKI (late 50’s) the
school principal.
ID?

MRS. KOSINSKI

LANEY
I forgot it today, busy morning.
I’ll bring it tomorrow.
MRS. KOSINSKI
Parent IDs are mandatory now. We
mailed them out last week. And
sent an email.
SUSAN
I’ll vouch for her.
Ma?

ELI

LANEY
It’s okay E, just a sec.
(to Mrs. Kosinski)
I’ve been walking them to class
every morning for two years. Can’t
you make an exception?
MRS. KOSINSKI
If I make an exception for you Mrs.
Brooks, then I have to make one for
everyone. Is that how you want to
teach our children?
Laney looks at her, stunned.

Pink (03/02/2014)

13.

MRS. KOSINSKI (CONT’D)
I wouldn’t think so. At this point
in the year Eli’s quite familiar
with how to get to his class.
He’ll be fine. And I’ll personally
escort Miss Janey to her classroom.
ELI
I’m okay Mom.
Laney feels nothing but shame. She is inferior.
JANEY
Me too, Mommy.
You sure?

LANEY

Janey nods her head yes - she is eager to get going.
I’m sure.

JANEY

Mrs. Kosinski reaches out her hand, Janey takes it.
LANEY
Wait, honey.
Laney kneels down.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Give me a kiss.
Janey gives Laney a kiss and goes.
It’s not as easy for Eli. He takes a deep breath, hoists his
backpack a little higher and begins the harrowing journey
down the crowded hall. Just outside the classroom he stops,
turns to look at Laney. Laney is fighting back tears. She
blows Eli a kiss. He catches it, puts it into his pocket and
disappears into the classroom.

An angry Laney heads to her car parked on the outskirts of

purse. She pulls out a cigarette just as she reaches her car.
She gets in and slams the door.

Laney fumbles through her purse for a lighter, assesses the
parking lot, looks in her rearview mirror.
LANEY
Fucking bitch.
She lights it in spite of her shaking hands.
LANEY (CONT’D)
(mocking)
“Is that how you want to teach our
children?...”
She reaches for the secret vial in her purse, unscrews the
lid, takes a deep breath, helps herself to a quick bump. She
looks around again, another bump. Laney takes a drag off her
cigarette as if it were her last and leans her head back on
the seat. A deep breath. And then, Bing! She picks up her
phone to read the text.
TEXT: DONNY

She turns on the engine and goes.

INT. REGENCY HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Laney is on her knees on the bed, ass in the air, holding
onto the top of the headboard. Laney and Donny are, how do
you say... fucking each other’s brains out. But in Laney’s
eyes is a look of detachment. She is somewhere else.
Laney and Donny lay in bed. She’s sucking on a lollipop.
LANEY
I gotta take a shower.
DONNY
It’s still early. Stay with me.
LANEY
Can’t, gotta pick up the kids.
DONNY
I love you.

Pink (03/02/2014)

15.

LANEY
No you don’t.
DONNY
Why do you say that?
LANEY
Because you’re married. And because
no man can love a girl whose ass he
just fucked.
DONNY
Christ Laney. You’re crazy, you
know that? I told you I’ll leave
Susan. I love you.
Laney laughs.
LANEY
That’s the funny thing... It
doesn’t matter.
Laney gets out of bed and is pulling on her panties.
LANEY (CONT’D)
I could love you and you could love
me, and nothing. It still means
nothing. Nine years of marriage,
two kids, three thousand marinated
chicken breasts - and nothing. And
then you die.
Donny pulls a pillow over his head, rolls over.
DONNY
Go take your shower.
20 MINUTES LATER: Laney, freshly showered, walks out of the
bathroom. She glances at Donny... out like a light. She takes
the cash out of his wallet and the last of the cocaine
sitting next to it. She grabs her things and leaves, the selfclosing door slams behind her.
The door wakes Donny. He looks up, looks around, no trace of
Laney. He stretches, sits up, puts on his underwear, walks
into the bathroom.
Donny is standing in the doorway looking at the bathroom
mirror. In red lipstick he reads: “DON’T LEAVE SUSAN”.

Laney is speeding down the turnpike. She’s amped up and
emotional, seemingly reckless. She mistakenly passes her
exit.
Fuck.

LANEY

She is angrier than she should be, she’s in a spiral. She
turns off at the next exit. The Fed-Ex truck she's been
stuck behind turns left. The traffic light at the
intersection up ahead is changing from green to yellow to Laney closes her eyes, presses her foot deeper into the gas,
hands up, letting go. She drives straight through the red.
Cars screech to a halt, one swerves into another lane to
avoid her. Horns are honking. She miraculously arrives
across the street unharmed. A couple of cars pass. Honk. One
person curses her. More honks.
Laney pulls to the side of the street and puts her car in
park, takes a deep breath, exhales. She is visibly rattled.
She pulls the last smoke out of her pack and lights it with
shaky hands. Tears trickle down the sides of her face as
turns up the radio, puts her car in drive and goes.

SUSAN

There’s my son-Laney sees the kids filing out of the school into the front
entrance. Eli, holding Janey’s hand, sees her and waves.
Laney motions for him to walk to the car.
Eli gets into the car, quiet. Janey is eager to talk. Laney

Janey opens her arms as wide as she can to demonstrate her
love.

twisted behavior by Laney.

The whole family sits around the dinner table. They have
typical fare on their plates; spaghetti, peas, breaded
chicken - nothing Laney went out of her way to cook, but
homemade nevertheless. Laney’s plate is empty. She sucks on a
lollipop and sips a glass of wine.
Bruce observes her behavior for a moment.
BRUCE
Why aren’t you eating?
LANEY
Not hungry.

Laney opens the refrigerator- blocking her view of the table.
She downs her glass of wine behind the door.
BRUCE (O.S.)
All that sugar isn’t good for you.
Laney sets her empty glass on the top shelf, uncorks a bottle
of wine and refills her glass.
BRUCE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Empty calories. Right guys? Not
energy food.
Laney returns to the table with butter and sits. She grabs a
piece of corn on the cob, wipes it with butter and puts it in
her mouth. They all watch her and smile- like this is the
first time they've ever seen her eat. She smiles back.
ELI
Did you know the Pilgrims stole
America from the Native Americans?
They had the Native Americans teach
them how to grow corn and stuff and
then they stole their land.

LANEY’S POV: Through the window she can see them in the 24A
driveway. Bruce loosens his tie. Eli dribbles the ball, aims
for the basket, nearly makes it. Bruce kneels, positions Eli:
plants Eli’s feet, adjusts his arms. Eli shoots and MAKES IT!
Janey runs after the ball and brings it to Bruce. He lifts
her up so she’s able to dunk the ball. Through the kitchen
window we see Laney taking it all in. She puts her face in
her hands, it’s all too much.

Eli hurries with the soap. He signals that he’s done and
Laney holds a towel open. When Eli gets out of the tub she
wraps her arms tightly around him.
ELI
Mom? I can’t breathe.
Laney is still holding tight, too tight. Eli manages to break
away.

INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Eli has positioned himself in front of the television. Laney
stands at the edge of his doorway, takes in his broadening
frame. His shoulders, his back. There is a portable
keyboard against the window, a basketball hoop on the door
and a Jeter fathead on the wall. Laney nods, acknowledging
Jeter.
Hey--

LANEY

Eli glances at his mother.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Put on your T-shirt.
Laney tosses him the T-shirt.

Eli throws it over his head.

LANEY (CONT’D)
And dry your balls.

He turns and looks at her like she’s crazy.
Mom!

Eli rolls his eyes.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME

Bruce, just out of the shower, has a towel wrapped around his
waste. He’s clipping his toenails into a trash can. Laney
watches him from the bedroom door.
What’s up?

BRUCE

LANEY
I was just thinking...
About?

BRUCE

LANEY
About your balls.
BRUCE
(laughs)
What?
LANEY
About your balls. Do you worry
about drying your balls?
BRUCE
Do I worry?
LANEY
Yeah, like when you were a little
boy, did your mother teach you to
dry your balls or did you like...
just know how to do it
instinctively? Should I teach Eli
or Bruce examines his Q-tip, puts it in the other ear, continues
with his toenails.
BRUCE
You dry them like any other part of
your body.

Pink (03/02/2014)

Oh.

23.

LANEY

(pause)
But what happens if you don’t dry
them? Do you get a rash?
Bruce stops what he’s doing and looks at her- this
conversation is starting to get his attention.
BRUCE
I guess you could-- but whatever
you don’t get will just dry in your
underwear. What’s going on Laney?
LANEY
Your underwear! Why didn’t I think
of that?
Bruce leaves his grooming duties, picks Laney up and deposits
her on the bed.
INT: MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
BRUCE
All this talk about balls...
Bruce starts kissing Laney’s neck, unbuttoning her blouse.
She unfastens his belt buckle, giggles, but it’s clear she’s
going through the motions. Laney disassociates when she’s
having sex.
Uhh..

BRUCE (CONT’D)

He’s kissing her, getting close...
BRUCE (CONT’D)
You’re so beautiful Lane... Uhh...
Bruce finishes and collapses on top of her.
LANEY
I think my dad dried and powdered.
BRUCE
Christ Laney, can we change the
subject?
A beat.
LANEY
We gotta get rid of Bingo.

A pause.

Pink (03/02/2014)

24.

Bruce doesn’t respond.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Bruce, I’m serious we can’t keep
him.
BRUCE
It’s just a puppy Laney. All kids
get a puppy. Why can’t our kids
have a God damn puppy? Why does it
have to be such a big deal? Why
does everything have to be such a
big deal.
LANEY
Because puppies turn into dogs and
dogs get old and die. What’s a dog
live, ten years?
BRUCE
Yes. Ten enjoyable fucking years
that the kids can grow up with a
dog. Only you could manage to turn
getting a puppy into a negative.
LANEY
I’m trying to spare them a
negative, don’t you understand? The
dog will die and they will be
heartbroken!
BRUCE
That’s life Laney. That’s how it
works. Puppies die and Bingo will
die too. The kids will handle it.
LANEY
But I can’t handle it.
BRUCE
Then why bother loving anything?
Why bother loving me?
Laney doesn’t respond. Bruce softens. He sits down on the
bed, puts his arm around her.
LANEY
I just don’t understand why anyone
bothers to love anything at all. I
mean by the time you’re three
you’ve pretty much figured out that
everything you love is going to be
taken away. Every three year old
should run into traffic.

Pink (03/02/2014)

25.

BRUCE
Come on, Lane. You don’t mean
that.
LANEY
I do mean it. Might as well cut
their losses.
Bruce hugs her for a moment trying his best to comfort her,
then tries to lighten the mood.
BRUCE
That could be a new market for
me.... Insurance for three year
olds.
Laney pulls away.
LANEY
Bruce I’m serious!
BRUCE
So what do you suggest?
LANEY
To not fall in love. To not get
married and have kids. To not
pretend that it’s all going to be
okay when nothing is going to be
okay.
BRUCE
Well, thankfully most of us like to
fool ourselves.
Bruce quietly observes her for a moment, narrows his eyes
slightly while something occurs to him. He treads lightly,
masking the real question with concern.
You okay?

BRUCE (CONT’D)

LANEY
Yeah. Of course I’m okay. Why
wouldn’t I be okay.
Bruce brushes his fingers through her hair.
BRUCE
I just worry about you that’s all.
LANEY
I’m fine. I’m going to check on the
kids.

Laney jostles Eli.
LANEY
E, wake up. You’re having a
nightmare.
Eli opens his eyes, tears streaming down his cheeks.
LANEY (CONT’D)
What’s the matter E? Another bad
dream?
Laney instinctively puts her hand on his forehead to check
for a fever.
ELI
We were walking down the street to
go see dad and you were wearing
headphones Eli is still crying, little boy fresh out of a nightmare.
LANEY
Take a deep breath, it’s okay...
tell me...
ELI
I was trying to warn you but you
wouldn’t listen to me- you couldn’t
hear me because you were listening
to your headphones.
Laney brings a tissue to his nose.

Laney holds him tight.
LANEY
That will never happen Eli.
ELI
How do you know?
LANEY
Because I don’t have an iPod.
ELI
It’s not funny mom!
LANEY
It can’t happen because I won’t let
it happen.
Laney tucks Eli back in bed. She begins rubbing his head.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Go to sleep. Mommy’s here.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME

Laney lets Bingo out of the crate. She opens a cabinet and
takes out two brown lunch bags and a box of crayons. She
takes a loaf of bread and two small bags of organic chips
from a drawer. She’s about to make the kids’ their school
lunches but changes her mind. She opens another cabinet,
takes out a secret bottle of vodka and pours herself a nice
tall glass. She goes over to the phone, flips through the
school directory, searches for a name, picks up the phone and
dials. She looks down the hall to make sure nobody can hear
her.
LANEY
Is this Diane?
(pause)
LANEY (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry I know it’s late. This
is Laney Brooks, I’m Eli’s mom.
(pause) I’m fine. Actually no, I’m
not fine. I’m calling because Eli
came home today with a bunch of
stories about how the Pilgrims were
thieves and Thanksgiving is a lie.

LANEY (CONT’D)
He said that John told him. It’s
none of my business what you teach
your kids but I was really hoping
that you could - (pause) Sure I
understand that but um, well I’m
trying to teach my son to be
grateful for what he has which is
hard and Thanksgiving is - (pause)
but that’s a really important (pause) but that’s your opinion (pause) Look - I’m not calling to
have some kind of debate with you I
just want to - (pause)
Laney is fuming mad.
LANEY (CONT’D)
I have a great idea- why don’t you
leave the teaching to the teachers(pause)
LANEY (CONT’D)
That’s fine, and you can go fuck
yourself. And tell your little brat
to stay the fuck away from my kid.
Laney slams down the phone, searches through her bag and
locates her coke stash. She taps some coke onto the table,
rolls up a 20 dollar bill, snorts a line. She sits down at
the kitchen table and begins to flip through a magazine. She
gulps some vodka. She flips through the magazine again,
another gulp of vodka. Laney is clearly trying to drown out
the demons - fast. She gets up, leaves the kitchen.

Laney sits at the foot of his bed and watches him sleep for a

INT. JANEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Laney peeks her head in, the little girl is fast asleep.
Laney eyes her childhood teddy bear sitting on the shelf near
Janey’s bed - battered, one eye missing. She takes it from
the shelf, lies down on the floor.

Pink (03/02/2014)

29.

Face to face with the bear, Laney kisses it. She looks at it
again before she places it between her legs, eases onto it,
her crotch against the bear’s nose. She focuses on the family
picture next to Janey’s bed. She starts rocking back and
forth, eyes closed. This is a disturbing scene although Laney
masturbating is actually less troubling than her desperation
for connection.
The quivering stops, Laney pulls the bear from under her,
rolls onto her back. Glow-in-the-dark plastic stars glitter
on the ceiling. A combination of emotion and drugs overtakes
her.

She stumbles into the night stand and sits on the floor at
the edge of the bed. She pulls on the bedspread.
Help.

LANEY (CONT’D)

Bruce doesn’t hear her. She pulls on the bedspread and says
it again. A bit louder this time.
Help.

LANEY (CONT’D)

Bruce sits up, flips on the light, adjusts his eyes, looks
for Laney. The camera freezes on Laney’s face. Her hair is a
mess. Mascara runs down her cheeks. She looks like a
junkie. She is a junkie.

LANEY
I don’t hate you Bruce.
BRUCE
Then why did you stop taking the

LANEY
They make me fat.

Bruce’s anger rises.
BRUCE
That’s bullshit.

So you’d rather be insane?
LANEY
That’s a little melodramatic don’t

BRUCE
I think it’s pretty accurate.
Whatever.

gets it.
LANEY
That’s true Bruce. That’s what I’m
gonna work on while I’m gone. If I
de-cunt myself will you let me come
back?
BRUCE
I see what you’re trying to do.
You’re trying to make me look like
the asshole. Like I’m kicking you
out of the house instead of trying
to get you help.
Bruce calms himself down.

BRUCE (CONT’D)
And you know that’s not true. But
for some reason, for some fucked-up
reason, no matter how many times

Bruce looks at her, incredulous, but they can’t help but
laugh. It’s a nice moment.

EXT. BLUE HILL HOSPITAL - DAY - SAME

Bruce’s car pulls into the circular drive of BLUE HILL
HOSPITAL. Front and center is a sign that says “BLUE HILL
HOSPITAL Managing Mental Health Since 1954”. A no nonsense
NURSE PAULINE (early 50’s) is waiting for Laney by the
hospital entrance. It suddenly dawns on Laney that she’s
entering rehab. Bruce pulls up to the sign that says “new
patients”. Laney looks at the hospital, at Pauline and
finally at Bruce.
LANEY
I don’t think I can do this.
Bruce has tears in his eyes.

This is very hard for him.

NURSE PAULINE
Empty your bag please.
Nurse Pauline isn’t mean, in fact she’s pleasant. Laney dumps
her belongings onto the mattress. Clothes and personal
items, red lollipops scattered among it all. Nurse Pauline
takes her make-up bag, her phone, her blow dryer, two belts,
she inspects a winter scarf before she takes it, takes her
shoelaces out of her sneakers. She opens a pocket inside
Laney’s bag and pulls out two bottles of prescriptions and a
pack of cigarettes. She tosses the cigarettes back down on
the bed.
NURSE PAULINE (CONT’D)
You can keep these, you’ll get the
rest back when you leave.
LANEY
But I need my medication.
Nurse Pauline checks Laney’s prescription.
NURSE PAULINE
The Ambien has to go. And the
Xanax. Sorry, Honey. For now you
just get to sit back and enjoy the
ride.
Nurse Pauline turns Laney’s bag inside and out to make sure
she doesn’t miss any secret hiding spots.
NURSE PAULINE (CONT’D)
I’ll need your bra too Honey.

The nurse puts Laney’s bag on her shoulder.
NURSE PAULINE
Another nurse will be in soon to

You can spend as much time as you
like in here or you can go to the

I suggest you try to sleep and
drink as much water as you can.

Laney tries to watch TV, takes in her surroundings. A HEAVY

emotion. A YOUNG WOMAN flips through a magazine though she
doesn’t seem to really pay attention to its contents. Laney
eyes both of them, back and forth, paying close attention to
their disconnection and lifelessness. Laney doesn’t belong
here, or does she? She paces, looks out the window,
vacillates between frantic and resigned. She makes a run for

NURSE PAULINE
Take it easy. Why don’t you go back
to your room and get some rest.
This is the hard part hon. You’ll
feel better soon.
Laney is shaking, fidgeting, pissed off, sweating. She takes
a deep breath, the nurse puts her arm around Laney’s shoulder
to escort her back to her room. Laney throws her arm off.

the tears, Laney takes the bar of soap in her hand and begins
angrily stabbing at the wall with it. This is her release.
She gets out of the shower, wraps herself in a towel and
walks over to the sink. She stares at herself in the mirror,

A psychiatrist’s office. DR. PAGE (mid-50s) is sitting behind
a formidable wooden desk. Laney is facing him. Legs crossed.
Hands folded.
DR. PAGE
Since you aren’t talking I’ll
assume this is accurate unless I
hear otherwise.

He glances at a piece of paper on his desk.
DR. PAGE (CONT’D)
Your blood work shows that you had
cocaine, amphetamine, Ambien and
marijuana in your system. But no
trace of Lithium. I assume you
stopped taking it. Do you want to
tell me why you stopped taking it?
Laney doesn’t respond. Dr. Page has reached the height of his
patience with Laney’s silence though he remains calm.
DR. PAGE (CONT’D)
Nurse Pauline told me that you’re
desperate to go home. That you
don’t think you belong here.
I don’t.

LANEY

DR. PAGE
Then why are you staying?
Laney looks at him with total surprise.
DR. PAGE (CONT’D)
You’re an adult. You don’t have to
be here. Go home.
He picks up the phone and hands her the receiver.
Go ahead.

DR. PAGE (CONT’D)

LANEY
I have a family.
So?

DR. PAGE

LANEY
So-- so I can’t just go home and do
this all over again.
He hangs up the phone. Somehow he’s made this her idea.
DR. PAGE
Where would you like to start?
LANEY
Are we really gonna do this?

Pink (03/02/2014)

We are.

DR. PAGE

LANEY
What’s more interesting to you, the
drugs or the daddy issues?
DR. PAGE
(with humor)
I like to start with the daddy
issues because it makes for a very
organic segue into the drugs.
LANEY
Mine will bore you. He left when I
was nine. He kissed me good night
one night and I never saw him
again. Shall we move on to the
drugs now?
DR. PAGE
We’ll get there. Why is it that
you never spoke to your father
again?
LANEY
Because he never called me.
DR. PAGE
Did you ever call him?
LANEY
I didn’t know where he was.
And now?

DR. PAGE

LANEY
He’s upstate. My brother told me
that.
DR. PAGE
So your brother talks to him?
LANEY
He does. Or he did. I don’t know.
We don’t talk about my Dad anymore.
It always ends in a fight. My
mother was devastated when my dad
left. I guess I’ve held on to that.
My brother didn’t.
DR. PAGE
Did she remarry?

LANEY
A few years later.
DR. PAGE
Why didn’t you call him then?
LANEY
He was the adult. Why didn’t he
call me?
DR. PAGE
Why do you think he didn’t call
you?
She takes a moment.
LANEY
Maybe having a family isn’t for
everyone. Maybe you think that’s
the answer, that that’s what you’re
supposed to do because that’s what
you’ve been programmed to do since
you were a kid. But maybe that’s
not right. I mean, you shouldn’t be
allowed to just make babies and
fuck up other people’s lives
because you think you’re supposed
to adhere to this idea that
everyone tells you is right. Maybe
he thought he was doing me a favor
by leaving.
A beat. Dr. Page is silent while Laney contemplates what
she’s just said.
LANEY (CONT’D)

An emotionally exhausted Laney exits the building, cigarette

cigarette.
ZACK
It gets easier.

Zack walks over to Laney, hands her a cigarette and lights it

strong penchant for sarcasm. Laney takes a deep drag, eyes
Zack skeptically, exhales.
When?

LANEY

ZACK
Heh, I don’t know yet. That’s just
what they tell me. You just check
in?
LANEY
Couple days ago. But I really
shouldn’t be here. No offense, this
just isn’t the kind of place I
should be in.
ZACK
Oh yeah? What kind of place should
you be in?
Laney takes a drag off her cigarette, searches her
surroundings for an answer but comes up short.
LANEY
I don’t know. Not this place. It’s
depressing.
ZACK
Yeah. I feel you. Last week was
good though. Whole staff was all
freakin out. They fired one of the
nurses. Exciting.
LANEY
For what? Smiling?
Zack laughs, he likes her.
ZACK
No. She got caught having sex with
a patient in a broom closet.
LANEY
No way. What happened to the

Zack drops his cigarette on the ground and puts it out with
his shoe.

Zack leaves but looks back at Laney over his shoulder with a

BRUCE (V.O.)
Yeah, I know Lane but you’re not

LANEY
No, it’s just I should have been

Laney fights back tears. A NURSE approaches her with a small
tray in his hand, a handful of small paper cups with names on
them, and equal amount of cups of water. He hands her the
“Laney” cup, she turns her back to him. He taps her shoulder
and she turns around and takes the meds without argument.
BRUCE (V.O.)
It’s only been a week Lane. Just
focus on getting better. The kids

It’s cold out but Laney doesn’t seem to mind it. She sits
alone on the porch and contemplates the starlit sky. Zack
joins her.
ZACK
I understand if you have a death
wish but it sucks when you only get
pneumonia and can’t take the good
meds.
Zack takes his jacket off and wraps it around Laney’s
shoulders. He sits down next to her, hands her a cigarette,
lights it. Lights his own.
Thanks.

LANEY

They sit for a moment staring at the sky until Laney,
fighting tears, breaks the silence. Laney bites a cuticle.
Zack sees her wedding band.
ZACK
How long have you been married?
Forever.
Lucky guy.

LANEY
ZACK

Laney is flattered but restrains herself.
LANEY
Not sure he’d agree with that. But
thanks. (pause) How fucking great
would a shot of tequila be right
now?

ZACK
With a little lime.
And salt.

LANEY

Zack holds out his cigarette to hers, they bump them
together.
Cheers.
Cheers.

INT. BLUE HILL CAFETERIA - DAY

50

It’s visiting day. The room is filled with VISITORS. Zack
sits close to a beautiful, wholesome, blond. He tucks a lock
of hair behind her ear. Laney watches the exchange.
Janey and Eli are in line for dessert. Bruce and Laney are
sitting at a table. Some time has passed. Laney looks much
better, clear eyed. Bruce pushes his food around with his
fork.
BRUCE
You look great. You feeling better?
I am.

LANEY

BRUCE
Do you feel like you’re making
progress?
LANEY
Why don’t you just say what you’re
thinking?
BRUCE
Why are you so angry?
LANEY
I’m not angry.
Laney glances at Eli and Janey at the dessert table.
LANEY (CONT’D)
I’m not. I’m not angry. I’m scared
Bruce. I’m scared of everything.

Pink (03/02/2014)
BRUCE
Like what? What are you scared of?
LANEY
Everything. I know you think that
if I just take my medication that
everything will go back to the way
it was but it’s bigger than that.
Laney glances back at Eli.
LANEY (CONT’D)
What’s Eli doing with his eyes?
We see Eli twitch.
LANEY (CONT’D)
When did he start doing that?
Bruce doesn’t say anything.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Is he doing that in school?
BRUCE
I don’t know. No one’s called me
about it.
LANEY
You can’t wait for someone to call
you. What if kids are making fun of
him? You have to call his teacher
and find out what’s happening.
The both watch Eli for a moment, still twitching.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Promise me you’ll call his teacher.
Bruce puts his hand on top of hers.
BRUCE
I promise Lane. I’ll make sure
he’s okay.
Laney takes a breath and pulls her hands away.
LANEY
I need to tell you something Bruce.
I need to tell you some things,
some really fucking terrible things
I did when I wasn’t thinking
clearly but I need you to know so
I... so we can start fresh.

44.

Pink (03/02/2014)

45.

BRUCE
Don’t do this now Laney. You’ve got
a lot on your mind.
LANEY
No this is important. I need to do
this-Bruce looks over at the kids piling their plates high with
brownies.
BRUCE
Come on guys, that’s enough. Come
sit down.
The kids return, all smiles.
JANEY
They have chocolate cake and
brownies daddy! I like it here!
Bruce pulls Janey onto his lap, a human shield. Laney fights
the tears and musters a fake smile for Janey. Bruce meets
Laney’s eyes, but he has to look away.
EXT. BLUE HILL PARKING LOT - DAY - SAME
Laney is holding Eli’s hand as they walk down a path toward
the parking lot. (Eli has his huge knapsack on his back.)
Bruce and Janey are walking ahead of them.
ELI
I brought you something.
As he looks at her he rolls his eyes back in his head,
twitches them, squeezes them open and shut, rolls them again.
He doesn’t seem to notice that a ferocious tick has taken
over his eyeballs. Bruce and Laney look at each other, there
are no words. Bruce shakes his head and shrugs, unlocks the
door.
Eli drops his knapsack to the ground, opens it and begins
digging.
ELI (CONT’D)
I made this for you.
He hands her a hard object wrapped in newspaper. It says
“MOM” in purple crayon. Laney unwraps the gift. It is
perhaps the most beautiful thing she has ever seen.
LANEY
You made me a dream catcher?

Pink (03/02/2014)

46.

Eli, still eye twitching.
Yep.

ELI
No more bad dreams.

LANEY
It’s beautiful E. Thank you.
The kids get in the car. She helps buckle them in. Gives
them each a kiss goodbye. Bruce comes around to her side of
the car to say goodbye. Laney has tears in her eyes.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Promise me you’ll call the school
psychologist or Eli’s teacher first
thing in the morning.
Bruce puts his hands on her shoulders.
BRUCE
Focus on getting better Lane. So
you can come home. We need you.
He kisses her.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
I need you.
They get in the car. Laney stands in the parking lot and
waves as she watches them drive away. In the background we
see a WOMAN (60’s) hugging two YOUNG MEN goodbye.
As both cars are pulling out of the parking lot we see Laney
and the woman both standing alone, 20 feet away from each
other, Laney with the dream catcher in her hand. They are the
same. No words are exchanged. Yet there is an implicit
understanding between them: if only they could be in those
cars. If only it was as simple as driving away.
52

EXT. HOSPITAL PATH - DAY
Laney is jogging along the path. Zack runs up beside her.
Hey!
Hey.

ZACK
LANEY

ZACK
You’ve been avoiding me for a while
now and I’m starting to take it
personally.

47.

ZACK (CONT'D)
Though it’s hard to imagine I could
ever do anything wrong.
LANEY
I’m not avoiding you.
Laney doesn’t look at Zack.
LANEY (CONT’D)
I took up reading.
ZACK
Reading is good.
(Pause)
Are you pissed at me or something?
LANEY
Why would I be pissed at you?
Laney keeps running, Zack stops, out of breath.
ZACK
Can you just stop for a minute?
Laney stops, turns around. They’re both breathing heavily.
ZACK (CONT’D)
I don’t know you just seem pissed.
Everything okay? Kids okay?
LANEY
Everything’s fine. Good actually.
I’ve been working really hard in
therapy. Finally getting somewhere.
What about you? How’s your
girlfriend?
ZACK
My girlfriend?
LANEY
The girl who comes on visiting day.
The blond.
ZACK
Sienna? Sienna is good.
LANEY
That’s great. Happy to hear that.
Zack looks at her with grave curiosity. A charming smile
spreads across his face.

Pink (03/02/2014)

48.

ZACK
You’re jealous? That’s what this is
about?
Laney is embarrassed. For the first time we see her
vulnerable.
ZACK (CONT’D)
I don’t mean to be the messenger of
irony or anything but you’re
married. So unless you’re not
telling me something...
LANEY
I know, you’re right. Maybe I am
jealous.
Zack kisses her, she gives in for a moment before she pushes
him away.
ZACK
Whoa. I’m kinda getting mixed
signals here.
LANEY
I’m sorry. God. I’m really sorry.
Zack looks away, uncomfortable. Laney places a hand on his
cheek and forces him to look at her.
This is Laney. Vulnerable. Sweet. Spoiled. Lovely.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Zack- listen to me. I’ve made some
really stupid decisions in my life.
And as much as I’d love to be with
you it would just be one more bad
choice. I need to remember how to
be a friend. You know? I want to be
a friend to you. A good friend. And
I need to remember how to be a good
wife and mother. How to just- be a
real person. I’ve spent so much
time running away from my problems
because I didn’t want to feel any
pain and I’ve fucked up everything
in my life. Good things.
ZACK
I hear that. And you are a real
person Laney. A great person.

Pink (03/02/2014)

49.

LANEY
Thank you. I’m working on it. I’ve
gotta try. I deserve to try. My
kids deserve that.
Zack takes in his feelings for a moment before he masks them
with his trademark humor.
ZACK
So I guess I won’t be getting you
in the broom closet then?
They laugh and Laney looks at Zack with pure endearment and
gratitude. They hug each other, long and honest.
LANEY
I have to go. See you at movie
night?
ZACK
Yeah. Popcorn’s on me.
As she walks towards the camera, Zack calls from behind her
in the distance.
ZACK (CONT’D)
By the way- Sienna is my sister!
Laney stops for a moment of surprise. She smiles to herself,
and keeps walking.
53

INT. DR. PAGE’S OFFICE - DAY - SAME

53

Laney sits on her familiar chair, Dr. Page sits in his chair
behind the desk. They are observing each other in silence.
LANEY
You know the night before I came
here, even with everything I did
that night, I went into Eli’s room
to check on him. I sat down on the
edge of his bed. I just wanted to
watch him breathe. And I thought to
myself, he'll never know. Neither
of them will ever know how hard I
tried not to hurt them.
A beat.
LANEY (CONT’D)
Am I gonna fuck this up? I really
don’t want to fuck this up.

Pink (03/02/2014)

50.

DR. PAGE
Have some faith in yourself Laney.
You’ve made unbelievable progress
since you got here. Don’t you see
that?
LANEY
I do. Thank you for making me stay.
DR. PAGE
I didn’t make you stay. That was
your choice. And it was a good one.
Laney smiles at Dr. Page. He has empowered her.
54

INT. BLUE HILL LOBBY - DAY

54

Laney says goodbye to Nurse Pauline and gives her a heartfelt
hug. Zack walks over.
ZACK
Tell me you weren’t going to leave
without saying goodbye.
Laney smiles.
LANEY
I suck at good-byes.
ZACK
I’m going to miss you.
Laney glances through the window and sees Bruce drive up.
LANEY
I’m gonna miss you too Zack. Will
you call me when you’re out?
ZACK
Yep. I think I’m gonna hang here
for a couple more weeks though.
Nothing for me to rush home to.
LANEY
I think that’s a great idea.
Laney gives Zack a big hug.
LANEY (CONT’D)
My ride is here.
Zack looks out the doors and sees Bruce waiting against the
car.

Pink (03/02/2014)

51.

ZACK
That’s the guy you blew me off for?
I could totally take that guy.
They laugh like two old friends with an inside joke.
ZACK (CONT’D)
Go on. Get outta here and don’t
come back.
He smiles. Laney grabs her bag and walks out the door.
55

EXT. BLUE HILL HOSPITAL - DAY- CONTINUOUS

55

Bruce is leaning against the side of the running car. Laney
walks out the door, looks at her husband. He smiles at her
and to her surprise, without trying, she smiles back.
56

EXT. BROOK’S HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME

56

A handmade “Welcome Home Mommy” sign is hanging (half on/
half off) the front door. Laney’s SUV is parked in the
driveway. Lights are glowing from inside the home
57

INT. KITCHEN

- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

57

Laney and Janey are icing a cake. There is a fire in the
fireplace. It’s a lovely and traditional scene. Janey is
wearing a nightgown. Eli is wearing a Knicks Jersey. Bingo is
trying to jump up, looking for attention.
LANEY
Eli, want to ice the cake with us?
No thanks.

ELI

Janey starts whining that she can’t get it perfect.
JANEY
It’s not the way I pictured it.
It’s not perfect.
Janey is getting really upset. Laney bends down, wraps her
arms around her.
LANEY
It is perfect. It’s beautiful.
JANEY
No it’s not.

Pink (03/02/2014)

52.

Janey begins sobbing. Laney tries to calm her down. Eli walks
over, puts his arm around his sister’s shoulder. Laney looks
at him unsure, desperate almost.
LANEY
I don’t understand why you’re
crying. It’s a beautiful cake.
Isn’t it Eli?
I like it.

ELI

Bruce comes up the stairs.
BRUCE
Basement’s dry.
Bruce sees Janey crying.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
What’s going on?
LANEY
She doesn’t like her cake.
BRUCE
But that’s a great cake Janey. It’s
the best cake I’ve ever seen.
Really?

JANEY

BRUCE
Really. Can I smell it? Does it
smell as good as it looks?
Okay.

JANEY

Bruce leans over the cake and purposely puts his nose in the
frosting. Janey starts giggling.
BRUCE
Yep, it smells as good as it looks!
Daddy!
What?
Your nose!

JANEY
BRUCE
JANEY

Pink (03/02/2014)

53.

BRUCE
What’s wrong with my nose?
Bruce pretends like he doesn’t know there is frosting on his
nose. He feels all around his face, everywhere but the
frosting on his nose. Janey is now laughing.
JANEY
I want to smell it!
Janey sticks her nose in the frosting. Bruce motions to her
nose.
BRUCE
Oh, you’ve got a little something.
Pretending she doesn’t know.
What?

JANEY

BRUCE
Just a little....
What?

JANEY

Laney comes over, aware of the fun.
LANEY
Can I smell?
JANEY
Yes! Smell it mommy! It smells
great!
Laney leans over to smell the cake, Bruce pushes her head
into it a little further, teasingly. Laney has frosting
covering her nose and a bit of her face.
LANEY
That is the best smelling cake. It
really is.
Eli watches the happy moment, for now he’s an outsider as
Bruce, Laney and Janey play with the cake and laugh.
BRUCE
Hey E, come smell the cake!
Eli shrugs his shoulders. He’s not buying into the happy
family yet. Laney understands. In the midst of the fun, the
power goes out. It’s pitch black.

Pink (03/02/2014)

Mommy!

54.

JANEY

LANEY
It’s okay Muffin, the power just
went out. It’ll be back soon. Bruce
can you find some candles?
Bruce retrieves a handful of candles from a kitchen drawer.
He lights one, we can see a little. Laney helps him to light
more. Janey is quietly crying. In a matter of seconds the
kitchen is lit up, candles all around. Candlelight and noses
full of frosting.
BRUCE
(to Janey)
See? Look at that!
LANEY
(to Janey)
Better?
Sort of.

JANEY

BRUCE
Here, here’s one just for you.
Bruce puts a candle in the cake right next to Janey who is
still lightly sobbing.
You ready?
Yes.

BRUCE (CONT’D)
JANEY

Bruce lights the candle, which lights up Janey’s face. Her
crying fades.
BRUCE
(begins to sing softly)
This little light of mine, I’m
gonna let it shine. This little
light of mine I’m gonna let it
shine.
Laney cautiously joins in.
LANEY AND BRUCE
This little light of mine, I’m
gonna let it shine, let it shine
let it shine let it shine.

Pink (03/02/2014)

55.

Bruce takes Laney’s hand, this is a very happy and romantic
scene. He begins to dance with her, both with frosted noses
and somewhat cautious. Eli can’t help but watch, hints of a
smile on his face. Janey is smiling ear to ear. She joins in
singing.
BRUCE, LANEY AND JANEY
Down in my heart, I’m gonna let it
shine. Down in my heart, I’m gonna
let it shine.
Bruce takes Janey’s hand and pulls her off the bar stool. He
starts to dance with her. She smiles.
Laney turns to Eli, waves him over. He resists, hands in
pockets. She waves him over again. This time he comes.
BRUCE, LANEY AND JANEY (CONT’D)
Down in my heart, I’m gonna let it
shine, let it shine, let it shine
let it shine.
Now they are all dancing in the kitchen by candlelight. Laney
takes a swipe of icing off her nose and puts it on Eli’s.
They are all laughing. Bruce puts his arm around Laney, licks
her nose playfully, they continue to dance.
PULL BACK: The camera begins to pull back revealing the
glowing kitchen, the family is dancing, their voices fade.
58

EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

58

Laney is standing in the hallway just outside the elementary
school guidance councilor’s office. She is wearing her parent
badge around her neck, Janey next to her is wearing her
tiara. Eli and Bruce are playing with his iPhone. A mom is
passing through the hallway.
LANEY
Hey Jessica!
Jessica gives Laney a dismissive smile and wave, carries on
down the hall. Laney is slightly dejected, Bruce sees the
exchange.
Ignore it.

BRUCE

MR. ODESKY, the guidance councilor, open’s his office door.
MR. ODESKY
Come on in.

Okay.
59

ELI AND JANEY

INT. MR. ODESKY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

59

Mr. Odesky motions for Laney and Bruce to sit.
MR. ODESKY
Nice to meet you both.
Mr. Odesky takes his chair behind his desk and motions to the
empty chairs across from him.
MR. ODESKY (CONT’D)
Please, take a seat.
Mr. Odesky has a file on his desk which he seems to be
familiar with.
MR. ODESKY (CONT’D)
How’s the re-entry going?
BRUCE
A little choppy.
LANEY
He hates me.
BRUCE
He doesn’t hate you.
LANEY
He hasn’t forgiven me yet.
MR. ODESKY
You need to give him time. Build
back his trust. He’s scared you’re
going to leave again. That’s a
rational fear.
A beat.
MR. ODESKY (CONT’D)
I’m glad you called me Mr. Brooks.
I think we need to be proactive in
this situation. Mrs. Zeldis is
concerned about Eli’s recent
behavior in class.
(MORE)

Pink (03/02/2014)
MR. ODESKY (CONT’D)
One of the issue’s is that he’s
being disruptive.
How so?

BRUCE

MR. ODESKY
He interrupts Mrs. Zeldis in the
middle of her lessons- asks
questions he knows the answers to.
It’s a way to get attention. She’s
working on that. But what concerns
me more are his rituals. The eye
blinking, the constant pencil
sharpening. Recently he’s started a
pattern with tapping his feet.
Bruce and Laney look at each other.
MR. ODESKY (CONT’D)
These behaviors suggest anxiety;
the rituals are a way for Eli to
stay in control.
Laney looks uncomfortable.
MR. ODESKY (CONT’D)
It’s not unusual but it becomes a
problem when the rituals get in the
way of functioning. When they
become all consuming.
BRUCE
So what do we do?
MR. ODESKY
In my opinion Eli needs to see a
specialist. Perhaps start with
Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Or
perhaps he can even benefit from
medication.
BRUCE
Medication?
LANEY
(to Bruce)
This is my fault. He has my genes.
Stop it.

Laney and Bruce exit office and are met with
A relief.

BRUCE
Anyone here in the mood for some
ice cream!?

Laney smiles.

ELI AND JANEY
She takes Eli’s hand, Bruce and Janey follow.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

61

Bruce, Laney, Eli and Janey are walking to the car. Laney and
Eli still holding hands.
ELI
Did you go to rehab because you’re
a drug addict?
Laney looks to Bruce. Bruce shakes his head. He’s irritated.
LANEY
No. Of course not. Where did you
get that idea?
ELI
John Frye said you’re a drug addict
and that’s why you went to rehab.
JANEY
Drugs are bad mommy.
BRUCE
That’s not why she was there Eli.
John Frye is just trying to get
your goat.

Pink (03/02/2014)

59.

JANEY
Eli doesn’t have a goat.
ELI
Then why were you there?
Laney stops walking and turns to Eli. She bends down on her
knee and puts her hand on his back, bringing him closer to
her. His eyes start twitching.
LANEY
I was having some troubles in my
mind. And because of those troubles
I started doing some things that I
shouldn’t have been doing.
ELI
Then why did you do them?
LANEY
Well, it’s complicated.
Laney cups her hands gently around his eyes as if to calm
them and stop the twitching.
LANEY (CONT’D)
But I saw a doctor who was very
smart and he helped me make sense
of my troubles. And now I feel a
lot better.
ELI
Did Mr. Odesky tell you to send me
to rehab too?
Laney hugs him tight. Bruce looks away.
62

INT. ICE CREAM PARLOUR - DAY - SAME
All four are looking in the window at the flavors of ice
cream.

I don’t know yet.
There is a pimply teenager behind the counter.
TEENAGER

60.

JANEY
I want the pink one please.
LANEY
And I’ll have a small scoop of
chocolate. Kid size.
TEENAGER
We don’t do kid size for adults.
Laney’s instinct is to get irritated. She calms herself.
LANEY
I’ll pay for a regular scoop - just
make it in a kid cup.
TEENAGER
I can’t do that either. I’d have
to charge you for the cup size I
give you.
LANEY
(deep breath)
Fine. I’ll have a small.
BRUCE
I’ll have a scoop of vanilla on a
sugar cone.
The teenager gives them their orders.
TEENAGER
And the little man?
Laney waits for Eli to make his choice but Eli doesn’t say
anything. His eyes start contorting furiously.
BRUCE
What do you want Eli? Rocky Road?
No answer.
LANEY
Which one Eli? E? What are you
doing?
ELI
The lines. Look at the ice cream
mom. See how the edges of the
containers don’t connect to each
other? And the floor is crooked? If
I do this with my eyes -

Pink (03/02/2014)

61.

Eli rolls his eyes up into his head, holds them there, blinks
hard.
ELI (CONT’D)
It makes them all straight and I
can figure everything out.
Laney takes a deep breath. She looks to Bruce for help. Bruce
gets down on his knees.
BRUCE
You know Buddy, straightening out
all the uneven lines in the world
is a big job. Let’s just pick a
good flavor for now.
62A

INT. LANEY’S BATHROOM - MORNING

62A

Laney finishes brushing her teeth, spits, rinses her
toothbrush. She opens the medicine cabinet, puts her
toothbrush away and takes out a bottle of medication. She
unscrews the cap and taps a pill into the palm of her hand,
puts it in her mouth and draws some water out of the faucet
to wash it down. Laney closes the medicine cabinet, glances
at herself in the mirror. She fixes her hair, tilts her head.
She is content with what she sees.
63

INT. TOY STORE - DAY

63

Laney and Eli are perusing the super-hero aisle of a toy
store. Eli holds a plastic baggy filled with crumpled bills
and coins.
ELI
Mom! Look at this one! It’s so
cool.
LANEY
Really cool.
Just then Donny and Henry come around the corner. Donny has
that split second where one decides if they pretend not to
see you, or face the music. In that same second, Henry spots
Eli. Decision made.
Laney and Donny are both taken off guard.
Eli!
Hey Henry!

HENRY
ELI

Pink (03/02/2014)
DONNY
Look who’s here!
LANEY
Hey Donny. Hey Henry.
Donny and Laney give each other a weak hug.
DONNY
Good to see you back.
LANEY
Thanks. Good to be back.
Henry and Eli try to solve the superhero dilemma.
HENRY
Which one are you getting?
ELI
I have to see what I can afford. I
have fourteen dollars and eightytwo cents.
HENRY
Wow. That’s a lot.
ELI
I guess so.
DONNY
I’d pick a superhero if I were you
Eli. Personally, I always wanted to
be the kind of superhero that
swoops down, rescues the woman from
the burning building and flies her
to safety.
This is clearly for Laney’s benefit.
HENRY
So you can’t be Batman cuz he
doesn’t fly.
ELI
And Spiderman doesn’t really fly,
he swings.
DONNY
What do you guys think? What kind
of superhero should I be? Maybe
Superman? I’d be a good Superman,
heh?

62.

Pink (03/02/2014)

63.

Behind Donny, Susan comes walking down the aisle carrying an
infant seat. She’s very noticeably pregnant. Laney can’t
believe her eyes.
LANEY
Looks like you’re already a
superhero Donny.
Susan approaches Laney with a warm smile and a hug.
SUSAN
Laney! So good to see you! I’ve
missed you!
LANEY
I had no idea you were pregnant!
You’re glowing!
SUSAN
Oh bullshit. I look like shit and I
feel like shit. But I’m almost
halfway through, thankfully.
Donny is uncomfortable, Laney does some math in her head.
LANEY
That’s great. Really great you two.
Congratulations.
SUSAN
Hey- did you get my message? About
my birthday party?
LANEY
Yes! I’m so sorry. I did, I’ve just
been so busy trying to catch up on
things-SUSAN
It’s fine! I just wanted to make
sure you know it’s no pressure.
Really. I totally understand if
you’d rather skip it.
LANEY
No, we’re looking forward to it.
Eli interrupts, thrilled with his choice.
ELI
Can I get this one mom?
Sure.

LANEY

INT. JANEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It’s bedtime. Janey’s wearing an adorable nightgown. Janey
snuggles beneath the covers.
JANEY
I have a wish.
LANEY
What’s your wish?
JANEY
I can’t tell it to you.
Why?

LANEY

JANEY
Because it won’t come true.
LANEY
Who told you that?
JANEY
I don’t remember.
LANEY
Well, whoever told you that must
not know about the ‘Mommy Clause.’
JANEY
The ‘Mommy Clause?’
LANEY
You can always tell your mommy a
wish.
Good.

Janey throws her arms around Laney’s shoulders.
JANEY (CONT’D)
I wish you would love me forever.
LANEY
You never have to worry about that,
baby. I’ll always love you.
Forever?

JANEY

LANEY
Forever. Now close you’re eyes,
it’s bedtime.
JANEY
Are you going somewhere?
LANEY
I told you Honey- Mommy and Daddy
are going to a birthday party.
JANEY
No! Don’t go! I don’t want you to
leave!
Janey goes from 0 to 60 in a second. A full blown tantrum
ensues.
LANEY
Janey we’re just going for a few
hours! I’ll be here when you wake
up in the morning!
JANEY
No! No! Don’t leave me! Mommy! Stay
here!
Bruce has obviously heard the screaming and he appears in the
doorway wearing a suit. Janey throws her arms around Laney as
if she can stop her- all the while screaming and crying.
Laney looks to Bruce for help, Bruce let’s out a deep sigh of
frustration.
JANEY (CONT’D)
You can’t leave me mommy!

Laney just shakes her head, she’s seems overwhelmed with
sadness. A tear streams down her cheek.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
It’s just separation anxiety Lane.
All kids do that.

Laney puts the cigarette in her mouth.

I didn’t mean it like that. I just

harder that I don't know what I'm

Laney’s amused.
LANEY (CONT’D)
You were there and willing, and I

Don't worry. You didn't drive me

Donny is perversely disappointed.

Yeah. Thanks.
Donny opens the door to return to the party, stops a beat and
then...
DONNY
I mean. Not my house. Call my
office. You need anything you talk
to Janine. Okay? Anything.
Laney smirks, acutely aware of his audacity. Donny digs his
cigarette into the concrete with his shoe and makes his way
back into the restaurant. Laney dials a number on her cell
phone and holds it against her ear.
Hello?

LANEY
It’s mommy. How are you?

INT. PRIVATE PARTY - NIGHT - SAME

Bruce and Laney are sitting at a table near the dance floor
with DAVID BLACKMAN (mid-fifties) and his trophy wife KATRINA
(mid-twenties). David is a slick looking garmento, Katrina
has quite the jewelry wardrobe. The table is rife with
alcohol.
BRUCE
I cover all of that in the book but
to answer your question, there
really is no such thing as having
too much life insurance. Especially
if you’re planning on having more
kids.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
And no offense David because you
look like you’re in great shape,
but I’m guessing Katrina is going
to outlive you.
Bruce is playfully ribbing him while expertly navigating the
waters of business and personal. David laughs, he obviously
finds Bruce charming.
DAVID
That’s my plan. Plucked this one
straight out of high school.
Katrina elbows him and smiles.
KATRINA
I was almost out of college.
BRUCE
Well, the book covers lots of
unique scenarios. I see it like
this David. There’s a bible for the
afterlife. I wrote the bible for
the here and now.
DAVID
Well it sounds brilliant. The whole
notion of hedging your bet against
God.
A WAITER arrives with a tray of cocktails. Laney pulls a
lollipop out of her purse and starts sucking on it.
KATRINA
You know, I’ve always dreamed of
writing a book. How did you do it,
Bruce? Did you just sit down and
type what you were thinking into a
computer or did you pay someone to
help you?
BRUCE
It's sentence by sentence. Anyone
can do it. Call me anytime. I'd be
happy to help you.
Bruce takes his business card out of his wallet, passes it
across the table. He is a professional.
LANEY
What do you want to write a book
about?

KATRINA
Like, maybe a children’s book or
something. I’m not sure yet.
Laney feigns interest in her.
LANEY
You know Katrina, I'm thinking of
writing a book too.
KATRINA
Really, on what?
LANEY
On prostitution.
BRUCE
(embarrassed)
Prostitution? Honey what do you
know about prostitution?
LANEY
Well I’ve been thinking about it.
Prostitution is the perfect example
of hypocrisy. It's illegal to sell
your body. But when you're rich
it's perfectly acceptable. We just
call it being a wife.
Bruce looks at her with hardened eyes. Laney smiles, returns
the stare.
LANEY (CONT’D)
What do you think Katrina?
Katrina doesn’t know how to respond. Across the room Donny
taps a spoon against a champagne glass. The guests quiet.
DONNY
I’d like to make a toast to my
beautiful wife.
Susan's right up next to him, beaming.
DONNY (CONT’D)
I know you guys are here to dance
and have fun so I'm going to make
this short. Suze, I just want you
to know, when I drive away to work

Laney is stretched out on the bed. She watches Bruce as he
undoes his tie, unbuttons his shirt.
LANEY
When are you gonna to talk to me?
BRUCE
Why would you do that? Say you're
going to check on the kids and then
you come back babbling about
prostitution? I was this close to
getting David Blackman as a client.
I know.

LANEY

BRUCE
Do you? Do you have any idea how
hard I work to keep it all going?
Because you act like it's all some
big joke. Like what I do for a

him sweetly. He smiles at her, understanding.
LANEY (CONT’D)
I really am sorry. It was out of
line. She was just such a-BRUCE
Prostitute?
They laugh, real and true. Finally a joke not at their own
expense. A silent moment passes while Bruce changes his tune.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
Come with me to the conference this
weekend.
LANEY
I don’t know Bruce. You know how
those things are. Everybody’s shitfaced for three straight days.
BRUCE
Not us. Nothing stronger than water

Get a massage.
LANEY
What about the kids?
BRUCE
They can stay with my sister.
LANEY
They’re having a hard enough time

They’ll be fine. Happy parents make

Laney glances up at the ceiling. She rolls over to face him.
His eyes are earnest. Warm.

Bruce is saddened by this.

He turns off the lamp, fluffs his pillow and rolls onto his
side. Laney stares at the ceiling. A moment passes.
LANEY
I’ll go with you.
ON: Bruce. A softness coming to his face.
He reaches around her waist and pulls her close into spooning
position, kisses the back of her head and closes his eyes.
Thank you.

Oh no.

able to give me a ring like this?
Bruce kisses her forehead.

Oh yeah, different story. Once upon
a time there was this incredibly
awkward kid from Teaneck. He used
to make a couple bucks racking
magazines at a store around the
corner from his house. He was
usually bored out of his skull but
one day this knockout comes in.
Long black hair. Long thin legs.
And she even had nice...
Bruce holds his hands out in front of his chest, mimicking
giant boobs.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
And there was something about her.
Her eyes, they seemed...sweet.

Just let me tell the story. So he
started dressing up a little for
work-LANEY
Bullshit. He wore T-shirts
BRUCE
If you knew how carefully he
selected them for fit and color-Laney laughs.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
Point is, everyday, all he could
think about was the next time she’d
come back.

When he turned around, she boosted
a candy bar and stuck it down her
pants, paid for her cigarettes and
walked out. But before she left she
turned around and gave the kid this
big huge smile. Blew his mind. He
thought-- ”this chick is hot and
crazy.” So he followed her out of
the store thinking he was gonna get
the nerve to talk to her. But
then... then she did the thing that
just owned him. She went around the
corner and gave the candy bar to
the homeless guy who lived in the
alley. Kid was done. From that
moment she owned him. He wanted to
marry that girl.
LANEY
And did he?
BRUCE
Yes he did.
LANEY
Even though she told him not to?
BRUCE
Yep. Even though you told me not
to.

Sweetheart you have to ask who it

Laney stares at Daisy for a moment before she turns her gaze
to Roger who is walking toward the door. Awkward silence. It
takes him second but then he realizes - takes a breath and
instinctively puts a protective arm around Daisy's shoulderthe way one would do when confronted by a stranger.

Roger is silent, staring in amazement. Daisy looks up to him
in confusion.
Hi.

DAISY

were little?
LANEY
I sure did.
DAISY
What color?

Yellow with blue shutters.
Laney looks at her father. A moment is had between them.
Laney collects the wooden family members. One by one she
brings them into the living room, seats them on the couch.
The mother in her checkered apron, the father, daughter

ROGER
She loves that bike. Got it for her
eighth birthday. (pause) I was
right about her age when I hit my
first home run. I was so excited I
ran all the way home from school.
Completely out of my mind. P-O-P.
Brought in three runs.
Roger never takes his eyes off Daisy.
ROGER (CONT’D)
Daisy! Slow down around the corners
honey. You’re gonna fall.
Daisy slows down.
ROGER (CONT’D)
I took the stairs two at a time,
'Ma!' I shouted, 'Ma!' I couldn't
wait to tell her. I didn't even
knock; I just busted right into her
bedroom. And there she was,
unconscious. Face down on the floor
in a pool of her own vomit.
LANEY
You never told me that.
ROGER
You were too young. Drank herself
to death. I don’t even think your
mother knows that. Took me until I
was fifty to stop being angry.
Something about the way Roger communicates this, his tone,
the way he looks at Laney and the concern in his eyes, gives
it away.
LANEY
Who told you?
ROGER
Your brother.
Laney takes a minute to process.
LANEY
I’m not angry, Dad.
ROGER
Of course you are.
They watch Daisy pedal along the driveway.

Laney’s gown still hangs from the door, perfectly pressed.
Bruce pulls his suit out of the closet, places it in the
garment bag and zips it up. He is packing with some urgency.
Or is it anger? There is a suitcase on the bed, a small mess
of clothes waiting to be folded and packed. The hotel room
door opens quietly as Laney tries to slip in without being
heard. Her plan is foiled right away when she sees Bruce. He
hears her but doesn't bother to turn around. Laney gathers
her courage.
LANEY
I’m so sorry Bruce. I fell asleep
by the lake.
Bruce is silent.
LANEY (CONT’D)
By the time I woke up I already
missed the ceremony. And then I was
too nervous to come back. I didn’t

doesn't.

purse. I know I shouldn’t have
taken any butBruce grabs Laney’s face in his hand like he’s going to snap
her neck off.
BRUCE

He squeezes tighter, then lets go.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
Why is it so easy for you to look
me in the eyes and lie to me?
He stares at her. Small pools of tears have settled in the
corners of Bruce’s eyes.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
Do you even love me Laney?
LANEY
Of course I do.
BRUCE
Just not enough I guess.
He looks at Laney with a mixture of love and regret.

When are you coming back? What
about Eli’s piano recital?
This is almost comical. He shakes his head. Laney, mother of
the year.

BRUCE
I’ll be back in time. They’ll stay
with my sister until I get home.
LANEY
What? You don’t trust me?
BRUCE
No. I don’t.
He walks toward the door, bag in hand, turns back to Laney.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
This is my fault. I shouldn’t have
brought you. It was too soon.
LANEY
So you’re just leaving? You’re just
leaving me here alone?
BRUCE
Yeah. You always seem to find your
way home eventually.
He opens the door.
BRUCE (CONT’D)
I just don’t know if I want to be
there next time you do.

Laney unlocks her front door and pulls her suitcase in behind
her.

INT. BROOKS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

80B

Laney parks her bag next to her, looks around and feels the
emptiness. Janey’s ballet outfit it on the bench, Eli’s
backpack. Laney walks into the family room. Slow but
deliberate.

INT./EXT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

80C

Laney turns on a table lamp and gazes at a few photographs of
her family on the table next to it. She walks over to the
window, looks at the basketball court. It’s empty but for a
ball and Janey’s pink bike.

INT. PIANO RECITAL - DAY

88.
81

Modest suburban living-room, upright piano, folding chairs.
Eli is wearing a navy sports coat over a Knicks jersey. Janey
plays with her Barbie doll. Laney glances out the window and
then back to Eli who is doing his eye ritual, blinking hard.
He seems to have added a new step - he twists his mouth,
holds his lips in a tight squeeze, waits a beat, releases and
then again. A young girl SABRINA (age 10) finishes her
recital piece. The AUDIENCE claps. MRS. MATTINGLY (30’s),
Eli’s piano teacher, steps to the front of the room. She
gives Sabrina a hug.
MRS. MATTINGLY
Let’s give Sabrina another round of
applause.
Laney hears a car door slam. She looks out the window and
sees Bruce, still with rolling bag, just in time. He walks
in, scans the room. There is an empty seat next to Laney but
he chooses to take a seat in the back. Janey sees him and
leaps down the aisle.
Daddy!

JANEY

She grabs his hand in an effort to lead him to their seats
but he doesn’t follow. Instead he scoops her up onto his lap.
Ostensibly he doesn’t want to interrupt Mrs. Mattingly but in
truth he doesn’t want to be near his wife. Mrs. Mattingly
sees him politely sitting in the back.
MRS. MATTINGLY
It’s okay Bruce. This isn’t
Carnegie Hall. Go sit with your
family.
As Bruce makes his way down the aisle we see Laney and Eli
slide over to make room for him. Bruce sits down next to
Eli, Janey on his lap. He puts his arm around his son’s
shoulder. Eli is twitching away. Laney and Bruce barely make
eye contact.
MRS. MATTINGLY (CONT’D)
So much has been written about
Beethoven’s deafness but my
favorite story is this one. After
the first performance of The Ninth,
Beethoven stared blankly at his
orchestra. A thoughtful musician,
realizing he couldn’t hear the
clapping, turned Beethoven around
to face the audience.

MRS. MATTINGLY (CONT’D)
It was Beethoven’s eyes, not his
ears that conveyed the symphony’s
triumph. Now let’s use our eyes and
ears while we welcome Eli Brooks to
the stage. Eli will be performing
the final movement of the Ninth.
The Ode to Joy.
Eli, all three-foot nine walks up on stage as the audience
politely claps. He takes a seat at the piano. He composes
his hands properly but doesn’t begin. This is gut wrenching.
His eyes start twitching, his mouth is turning. Laney holds
her breath, eyes wide in anticipation.
BRUCE
(under his breath)
Come on Buddy....
Eli goes through another short series of eye twitches and
mouth contortions. This moment is taking forever, the room is
silent in anticipation. A PARENT subtly turns around to look
at Laney for her reaction. Laney sits up straighter, stoic,
masking her nerves. And then amazingly, without any twitching
of the neck, contorting of the mouth, blinking of the eyes,
Eli begins to play - fingers on keys, wrists raised.
This, the sound of her son, is, perhaps, the most beautiful
Laney's ever heard.
She secretly exhales and then because
she’s overcome with emotion, her eyes fill with tears. She
can feel Bruce watching her, she turns her head slowly. When
their eyes meet there is no malice. Instead a flicker of
hope, the mutual acknowledgement of their little boy’s
triumph. At that moment, as Eli takes his bow and the room
cheers, all is forgiven.

Bruce unlocks the front door and lets everyone into the
house. Bingo, wagging his tail, is there to greet them.
BRUCE
Don’t forget to take off your
shoes.
The kids smile. Leave their shoes on the mat. Put their
coats on the bench. All the while Laney is trying to compose
herself.

JANEY
Why are you crying Mommy?
LANEY
These are happy tears.
Laney walks over to Eli.

Kneels.

LANEY (CONT’D)
E-you were extraordinary today.
Breathtaking. I don’t think I’ve
ever heard anything more beautiful.
Laney puts her hands on Eli’s shoulders.
Her beautiful boy.

She takes him in.

LANEY (CONT’D)
I don’t deserve to be your mother.
Bruce is getting anxious about where this conversation may
lead.
BRUCE
Who wants a snack?
JANEY
Hot chocolate?
Sure.

BRUCE

JANEY
With marshmallows.
Bruce glances at Laney.

Her smile belies her anxiety.

LANEY
I have to run to the bathroom.
I’ll meet you there in a minute.
84

INT. BATHROOM - DAY - SAME

84

Laney closes the bathroom door, removes the tampon box from
the top shelf and pulls out the familiar white envelope. She
empties the contents of the envelope onto the floor. She
cuts lines, sniffs coke, glances at herself in the mirror.
Bingo scratches at the bathroom door, he wants to come in.
Laney ignores him.
There is a crash of some sort in the next room. The kids are
calling her name. Laney does one more line and starts
cleaning up in a hurry. She realizes she doesn’t have much
time.

Pink (03/02/2014)

Mom.

JANEY AND ELI
Moooooooom!

JANEY AND ELI

Eli enters the bathroom first, followed by Janey and Bingo.
Laney pretends to be looking for something.
LANEY
I lost my contact. Damn this floor
makes -it’s impossible to findLaney looks up. The three of them are staring at her. She
wipes her nose with her sleeve. There is blood on it. The
kids are visibly frightened as Bruce leads them out of the
bathroom by their shoulders.
JANEY
Mommy! What’s wrong with mommy?

INT. DONNY’S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

87

Walls covered with advertisements. Directly behind Donny is
a mock up of the spring ad campaign. A life-sized poster, a
caricature of Donny's father sitting on top of a cow.
Arms
in the air, cowboy hat, two lassoed yogurt pops. “The Dairy
King Rides Again.” Donny is taken aback by the site of
Laney: mascara running down her face, crusted blood on her
nose. She’s shaking.
LANEY
I need something to calm down.
Donny hands her a tissue, then guides her into a chair.
DONNY
What happened?

Pink (03/02/2014)

92.

LANEY
I don’t want to talk about it.
Laney wipes her nose, glances at the tissue. There’s blood
on it. She crumples the tissue into her hand.
DONNY
I can’t give you anything, Lane.
What kind of person would that make
me?
LANEY
Please Donny. Now isn’t the time
for moralizing.
DONNY
But you were just in rehab LANEY
Well now I’m not. Please!
Donny's office phone rings but he ignores it. Instead he
wets his thumb, wipes the dry blood from Laney's nose, tucks
a piece of Laney's hair behind her ear. A tear runs down her
cheek.
DONNY
It’s all going to be okay.
LANEY
Not for me. But it is for you you’re about to have a baby!
DONNY
We’ll figure it out.
Donny kisses the back of Laney’s neck. Then her mouth. He
slips his hand into her blouse. His cell phone rings. He
pulls it out of his pocket and looks at the Caller ID.
DONNY (CONT’D)
Hey Suze, what’s up?
Donny looks concerned.
DONNY (CONT’D)
Jesus! Are you at the emergency
room? Okay, take a deep breath.
What did the doctor say? Is he in
pain? I'm on my way. Everything's
gonna be okay.
Donny hangs up the phone.

LANEY
How many people you going to make
everything okay for?
Donny shoots Laney a look of disgust.
DONNY
This is my son.
He grabs his jacket and leaves. Laney opens Donny’s locked
desk drawer with a letter opener and rifles through the
prescription containers inside. She swallows some pills,
stuffs the prescriptions into her purse and leaves.

Laney takes a seat, eyes the BARTENDER for a drink.

A guy in a QUAKER STATE walks over to the bar.
QUAKER STATE
No Springsteen on the jute box?
This is Jersey.
He glances at Laney.
LANEY
Springsteen fan?
QUAKER STATE
How could you tell?
Laney smirks, unimpressed.
QUAKER STATE (CONT’D)
Best musician on the planet. Put
Jersey on the map.
Laney lifts the bottle to her mouth. She recognizes the
pathetic pick-up attempt but she’s willing to play ball.

QUAKER STATE

Quaker State moves closer.
QUAKER STATE (CONT’D)
What did you want to be?
Me?

Laney tries to make out the tattoo on his arm.
QUAKER STATE
You see me talking to anyone else?
LANEY
All I wanted was to get married,
have kids and live happily ever
after.
So?
So what?

QUAKER STATE
LANEY

QUAKER STATE

The pills have kicked in, Laney has that all too familiar
glaze.
LANEY
Who said I’m a nice girl?

Laney’s cheek is pressed up against a brick wall. There’s
trash all around: garbage cans overflowing with debris.

LANEY

QUAKER STATE
Lick what baby?
My ass.
Your ass?

LANEY
QUAKER STATE

As he bends down to lick her ass, Laney shoves him in an
effort to provoke him. She’s looking for trouble.
LANEY
No more fucker.
QUAKER STATE
I’ll tell you when it’s no more.
Laney has succeeded in instigating Quaker State. He draws
back her head and smashes her face against the brick. As she
reaches for the wound he pulls her arm back. Laney chuckles,
inviting more pain.
Fuck.

LANEY

He likes this.
That hurt?

QUAKER STATE

LANEY
Barely felt it. Is that all you
got?
Quaker State smashes her face into the wall one more time
which turns him on even more. He finishes and buttons up his
pants. She sinks to the pavement and watches as he dumps the
contents of her purse on the ground. He picks up the cash and
the two bottles of pills. He stashes the cash and one of the
bottles in his pocket, takes the lid off the other bottle and
pours the pills on Laney.
Want?

QUAKER STATE

Laney can't move her lips. The gash on her cheek is throbbing
but she looks remarkably at peace. She got what she wanted,
what she’s certain she deserved.

Pink (03/02/2014)

Laney gives a feeble smirk before she falls into a fog, in
and out of consciousness. She tries to get up, falls down
again. Did someone try to help her up? Did she hear voices?
She loses consciousness again.
FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. ALLEY - DAWN

As the sun begins to rise, Laney opens her eyes and takes a
second to place herself. She touches her cheek, feels around
for her bag. You can practically smell the alley- the piss on
the ground, the trash starting to defrost from the nighttime
cold. She sits up, reaches for her purse and all of her
belongings strewn around her.
92

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

Laney stumbles to her car. She looks for her keys but can’t
find them. She reaches for her iPhone. Her screen saver is
an adorable photo of Eli and Janey. We see Laney’s
reflection on the screen. Tears rolling down her cheeks. She
presses the button in her contacts that says, “Valley Cab”.
93

EXT. LANEY’S STREET - DAWN

93

Laney’s in the back seat of a taxi cab, her face black and
blue, dried blood. She’s a mess. We pass the same tall trees,
painted fences that we passed in the opening scene. The taxi
slows to a stop in front of her house. It’s early morning.
All the lights are off. Laney opens the taxi door.
LANEY
Can you wait?
The taxi driver nods his head.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY - SAME

Laney opens a cabinet and grabs two brown lunch bags. She
reaches into a drawer and grabs two bags of organic chips and
a loaf of bread.

Pink (03/02/2014)

97.

She opens the fridge, takes out two slices of American
cheese, two apples, two juice boxes... Her gestures are
steady and precise. Laney is on a mission: she is going to
make her children lunch.
She makes the sandwiches, cuts off the crusts, slices them
into fours, wraps them in tinfoil. Tears roll down her
cheeks. She peels the apples, cuts them into bites, rubs them
with lemon so they won’t brown and places them in a Ziplock.
She takes out a box of crayons and writes “JANEY” in bubbly
letters on one lunch bag and “ELI” on the other. She
decorates Janey’s bag with hearts and flowers and Eli’s bag
with basketballs and stars. The scene is tense and
heartbreaking.
Laney looks around the kitchen. There it is -- her life in
full. Toys, photographs, school pictures pasted to the
refrigerator, schedules and children’s artwork tacked to the
cork board.
It’s time to go. Laney walks towards the front door, Bingo
follows. But before she leaves she gets down on her knees and
kisses him. When she stands up she sees Bruce leaning against
the banister. He looks at Laney with sadness and resignation.
Daddy?

JANEY (O.S.)

Bruce hangs his head down, as if Laney’s battered face is a
slap to his own.
Daddy?

JANEY (CONT’D)

Laney looks up the stairs, then to Bruce.
LANEY
(Whispers)
I’m sorry.
Bruce watches as Laney makes the long short walk to the taxi.

EXT. BROOKS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The driver turns on the engine. As Laney steps in she
notices the light in Eli’s room come on. She closes the
door, presses her hand against the taxi window. Bingo,
wagging his tail, is standing with Bruce by the front door.
LANEY
(to taxi driver)
We can go.
