Thirty-Six

According to Wikipedia, “the average human being shares
his or her birthday with roughly 18 million other human
beings in the world.”
This obviously is not an exact figure nor science, and
assumes there is equal probability of the average person
being born on any day of the year (not counting February
29th).
There is no evidence that sharing the same birthday
creates any type of personality or behavioral link
between the 18 million people who share the same date of
birth.
If there is... Wikipedia hasn’t discovered it yet.

2.
EXT. HOUSE - EVENING
A quaint, 70’s style house in suburban Pittsburgh.
A sign indicates that the house has recently been “sold.”
INT. BEDROOM - EVENING (PITTSBURGH)
We take in the bedroom first. It doesn’t take long.
Four white walls. New carpet. A few MOVING BOXES.
A bare mattress rests on the floor, dead center.
WOMAN (O.S.)
You promise you like your gift?
The towel?

MAN (O.S.)
It’s absolutely terrible.

The man’s skinny, bare legs enter frame.

Suit’s on?
Yes, Ma’am.

He sits on the

WOMAN (O.S.)
MAN (O.S.)

WOMAN (O.S.)
(confirming)
Your birthday suit?
MAN (O.S.)
Only one I’ve got.
REVEAL a buck naked man named JACK (36), sitting on the
mattress. His man-parts are covered by a small TOWEL.
It’s a vintage, dish-towel sized, PITTSBURGH STEELERS
TERRIBLE TOWEL, an iconic piece of football memorabilia.
In steps his lovely wife, REBECCA (30’s).
outrageously pregnant.

She’s

She wears a BRA on the outside of her outdated maternity
gear, and carries a CUPCAKE with LIT CANDLE.
REBECCA
I had to put the lingerie on top of my
clothes.
I see that.

JACK

3.
REBECCA
It wasn’t a great moment for me.
JACK
Tradition is tradition.
She nods.
REBECCA
I’m gonna spare us both the seductive
birthday dance this year.
JACK
Sorry, Baby, but it’s my birthday and I’d
very much like to see the dance.
She SHRUGS.
REBECCA
Your funeral.
She starts walking to him seductively, but she can barely
move, so it’s just kind of slow and sad. Jack starts to
laugh...
REBECCA (CONT’D)
I will gag you dead with that towel.
He stifles the laugh.

She arrives at the bed.

REBECCA (CONT’D)
Your suit still fits, I see.
JACK
Getting a little tight in the middle.
REBECCA
I’ll have it taken in.
Jack smiles. She hands him the cupcake and falls onto
the bed, exhausted. From lying position she musters a
sad:
REBECCA (CONT’D)
Happy 36th Birthday to you/Happy 36th
Birthday to you/I have triplets inside of
me/I am Shamu.
Jack blows out the candle and lies back, face to face.
JACK
(adoring)
Do you know how much I love you?

4.
REBECCA
(smile)
You’ve made it pretty clear.
Jack leans to her stomach, talks to his unborn children:
JACK
Hey, Fearsome Threesome! Do you three
know how much I love your mother!? Do
you even have any idea!?
Rebecca responds with bad ventriloquy as “the babies.”
REBECCA
(baby voice)
We know, now shut up and let your fatass
wife go to sleep.
JACK
Oh no. Birthday tradition is birthday
tradition.
(still to babies)
Close your eyes in there, Kids. Daddy is
about to do some terrible things to Mommy.
REBECCA
Oh, there is no way in hell.
Jack, determined, tries kissing her neck.
REBECCA (CONT’D)
(amused)
How the hell can you possibly want me
right now?
JACK
In any state, my wife, you arouse me.
He kisses her neck more.
REBECCA
I bet I can make that go away.
JACK
Nothing you can say can-REBECCA
My water just broke.
Jack freezes.
Yep.

A beat, then...
JACK

5.
He jumps and starts scrambling about like a crazy person.
CUT TO:
EXT. DUPLEX - MEANWHILE (LOS ANGELES)
One of those cute LA Duplex’s that cost a fortune because
you can walk to the Grove (though you never do).
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
A refrigerator opens.

It is filled with junk food.

Dead center sits a SHEET BIRTHDAY CAKE.
the cake reads:
“36 is just a number.

The writing on

Happy Birthday, Kate!”

On the front of the box hangs a POST-IT NOTE.

It reads:

“Do not fucking dare eat this cake before your party,
Kate. Love, Kate.”
REVEAL a pretty but very overweight WOMAN staring into
the fridge.
This is KATE (36).
Kate stares longingly at the cake. We see that she’s
placed POST-IT’S over all the other food in the fridge.
Notes say things like:
“Throw this crap out” and “250 calories per spoon-full.”
She removes the cake post-it, only to reveal another:
“Seriously, what is wrong with you?”
Kate SIGHS, closes the fridge.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kate stares at a SCALE on her bathroom floor.
She takes off her shoes.

Her outer clothing.

She takes off her UNDERWEAR.

Her WATCH.

She thinks.

A NECKLACE.

FROM BEHIND we see an overweight woman, naked.

6.
Kate places the tip of one foot on the very bottom edge
of the scale. She presses down gently. Carefully.
The scale reads 34 lbs.
This makes Kate happy.

She considers leaving it at that.

No, she can’t.
She adds the second foot to the very, very bottom of the
scale... trying to weigh as little as possible.
The unevenly distributed weight on the bottom edge of the
scale causes it to upend.
Kate screams and goes flying.
CUT TO:
INT. OFFICE - MEANWHILE (NEW YORK CITY)
A trim, sharply dressed black man - RANDALL (36) - works
at a standing desk. The desk has a treadmill built in.
The window behind him has unending views of NYC.
PHOTOS of his young family adorn his desk - a pretty
WOMAN and two YOUNG GIRLS (6 and 8).
ON HIS COMPUTER: there’s an EMAIL open:
The subject reads “GOOD NEWS.”
The text reads, simply, “FOUND HIM.”
Randall stops the treadmill. Leans in close.
on AN ATTACHMENT. It opens, revealing:

He clicks

A PHOTOGRAPH of a 70-ish year old BLACK MAN, with STATS:
Name: WILLIAM HILL
Age: 73
Home address: 2644 Lincoln Dr., Apt 4C, Philadelphia, PA
Randall is frozen, staring at the photo.
VOICE (O.S.)
Got a sec, Boss?
Randall quickly starts shutting down the email.

7.
RANDALL
Yeah, just, hold on, I’m...
(then)
What’s up?
His office has filled with CO-WORKERS.
bearing a giant “36” candle.

There’s a cake

RANDALL (CONT’D)
Oh, no, please don-They start SINGING.
Randall contemplates jumping out the 45th story window.
CUT TO:
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS BACHELOR PAD - MEANWHILE
The kind of glass-walled house you admire and judge
disdainfully all at the same time.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
We OPEN on a framed POSTER, advertising a TV show called
“THE MAN-NY.” The poster shows a ridiculously handsome
and chiseled MAN-NY (36), shirtless and holding a BABY.
It reads: “Mondays: Where Handsome Happens.”
We PAN DOWN, revealing the same shirtless “Man-ny”
sitting against the headboard of his bed. This is KEVIN.
He’s drinking and bored.

Which is weird because...

In front of Kevin stand two scantily dressed BOMBSHELL
MODELS. We hear a party going on in the background.
They take in his massive bedroom, suitably impressed.
MODEL #1
We love your show.
Thank you.

KEVIN

MODEL #2
I binge-watch with my mom whenever I
visit her.
KEVIN
That’s incredibly revealing, thank you.

8.
MODEL #1
The baby in the show is super cute.
KEVIN
They’re actually triplets.
They look at him, confused.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
(explaining)
The baby. You can’t shoot with a baby
for a lot of hours, so we use triplets.
MODEL #1
That’s so awesome.
Thanks.

KEVIN

MODEL #2
Do you want to dance?
No.

KEVIN
You guys go ahead.

He sits there, drinking, as the girls turn on the most
obvious song ever - “Blurred Lines.” They dance
provocatively. Kevin barely pays attention.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
(almost to himself)
It’s my birthday today.
MODEL #1
(dancing)
That’s what the party’s for, right?
KEVIN
This is the pre-party.
at my sister’s.
(then)
I’m thirty-six today.

The real party is

MODEL #1
You don’t look thirty-six.
KEVIN
Yeah, thanks. How old are you-- no,
don’t answer that.
A beat.

9.
MODEL #2
(stripping, provocative)
And what do you want for your birthday,
Kevin?
Kevin thinks.
KEVIN
I don’t know. It’s a fair question. I’d
like to get off the show, I guess. I
hate those babies. I mean, one of them’s
cool. The other two kind of suck. You
know when you can tell a baby’s gonna
just turn out to be a douche. That’s how
I feel about those two babies. Not the
first one, that one’s okay. I wish that
baby was allowed to work more.
The girls stop dancing for a beat, trying to figure out
what he’s talking about. They give up, resume dancing.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
Thirty-six. Wow. I wanted to change the
world. Now, I’m the Man-ny.
(then)
You know when it all went bad for me?
Second grade. 1986, they were sending
the Challenger into space, do you
remember The Challenger - don’t answer
that. Christa McAuliffe. She was a
teacher. She was going to be the first
teacher in space. It was a huge deal.
First teacher in space. She was going to
change the world - don’t know how, but
you felt that. At least in second grade,
you felt that. Middle of the day in
school, they bring a TV into class, we’re
all watching the launch. Whole class of
eight-year-olds just watching. Then
BOOM! Thing just explodes. Little
pieces of sweet Christa McAuliffe are
raining all over Florida. Our teacher
shut that TV off like it was on fire, she
literally wheeled it out of the room.
Kids were hysterical. It was awful.
(then)
I wonder if that was the moment I decided
that changing the world just leads to you
blowing up into pieces all over Florida.
Maybe that’s how I wound up as the Man-ny.
He shakes his head, snaps out of it.

10.
The girls are just standing there, confused. “Blurred
Lines” continues in the backdrop, now even more awkward.
Sorry, I--

KEVIN (CONT’D)

He stops short, as if sensing something’s wrong.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
Did you just feel that?
They look at him.

A beat, then the PHONE RINGS.

KEVIN (CONT’D)
(knowing)
Guys, I’m sorry, that’s my sister,
something’s wrong. Give me a second?
He answers the phone.
Kate?

KEVIN (CONT’D)

INT. KATE’S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER
Kate (our overweight scale-faller) lies on the bathroom
floor, covered by a bathrobe.
Kevin ENTERS, lays a TUB of ICE CREAM against her ankle.
KEVIN
You didn’t have ice.
KATE
Well this is a low point.
If you haven’t figured it out yet, Kevin and Kate are
twins.
Kevin opens the ice cream. Hands Kate a spoon, takes one
himself. They ice her ankle with the tub as they
simultaneously eat from it.
KATE (CONT’D)
Do you think it’s broken?
Nah.
A beat.

KEVIN
You just banged it up pretty good.

They eat in silence.

11.
KATE
We’re thirty-six.
thirties.

Officially late

KEVIN

I know.

KATE
How did I get here?
get here?

How the hell did I

KEVIN
Do you remember third grade, the
Challenger explo-KATE
You’ve gotta stop with the Challenger
explosion.
KEVIN

Yeah.
Another beat.

KATE
You’re the only good thing in my life,
Kev.
KEVIN
I’m not that great.
I know.
Kevin nods.

KATE
That makes it worse.

They eat.

Kate looks at him.

KATE (CONT’D)
Say something to make me feel better.
Kevin thinks, then:
KEVIN
You have a good job?
KATE
I’m your personal assistant. I am my
twin brother’s personal assistant.
KEVIN
I couldn’t do what I do if it wasn’t for
you.

12.
KATE
You’re the star of the worst show in the
history of television, Kevin.
KEVIN
Yeah, but the day-to-day stuff-KATE
You nail models and rotate personal
chefs.
KEVIN
Yeah, but... wow, this is a depressing
conversation.
Kate continues eating ice cream.
KATE
I had this whole dream life I envisioned
for myself. I wanted a real career. I
wanted to marry a man like Dad. I wanted
to be a mom like Mom. Look at me, Kevin.
I ate my dream life away.
KEVIN
What are you looking for here, Sis? Give
me the magic phrase that will make you
feel better and I’ll say it.
KATE
Tell me to stop feeling sorry for myself.
Tell me to wake the hell up. Tell me to
lose the fucking weight.
KEVIN
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
the hell up.
(beat)
What was the last one?

Wake

KATE
Lose the fucking weight.
Kevin nods.

He looks at her, serious.

KEVIN
Now say it again.
Kate nods, realizes:
KATE
I’m going to lose this fucking weight.
Kevin smiles.

Kate looks at her brother, fondly.

13.
KATE (CONT’D)
You are so much smarter than you look.
KEVIN
Bane of my existence.
(then)
Want me to cancel the party?
KATE
Can we still eat the cake?
I guess.

KEVIN

KATE
Okay, but after that, I’m losing the
fucking weight.
CUT TO:
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAYS LATER
We’re back with Jack and Rebecca, our pregnant couple
from Pittsburgh.
They’re in a hospital room now, the type of “delivery’
room that has looked exactly the same for what feels like
centuries.
Rebecca lies on a bed. She’s in the very, very early
stages of labor. Things are relatively calm and - for
the moment - they are alone.
Jack wanders around the small delivery room, snooping.
JACK
You realize the kids and I will have the
same birthday?
I know.

REBECCA

JACK
Six weeks early is pretty early.
I know.
This hangs there.

REBECCA
Jack picks up a METAL TOOL.

JACK
Seriously, what on Earth could this thing
possibly be for?

14.
VOICE (O.S.)
It’s for rectal examinations.
one’s from the dirty pile.

And that

Before them stands an OLD DOCTOR (70’s).
DOCTOR
Just kidding. We don’t keep dirty piles
of things around here, I’m not a line
cook. But it is for rectal exams. Happy
to demonstrate later on you, Sir. But
for now, please put it down.
He closes the door.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Okay, I’m Dr. Katowski, but you can call
me Doc or Doctor K which is what most
people choose to do because it’s folksy.
Rebecca smiles.

She likes him.

REBECCA
Do you work with Dr. Schneider?
Doctor K sits down next to Rebecca.
DOCTOR K
Take a breath for me, Dear? A deep
breath. There you go. Are you relaxed?
Now repeat after me: “No matter what this
old man says...”
REBECCA
(hesitant)
No matter what this old man says.
DOCTOR K
“I am going to remain calm, collected,
and composed.”
REBECCA
(more hesitant)
“I am going to remain calm, collected,
and composed.”
Doctor K smiles.
DOCTOR K
Fantastic!
(then)
Dr. Schneider’s appendix burst an hour
ago. He just went into surgery. Stay
with me, deep breath.
(MORE)

15.
DOCTOR K (CONT'D)
In between screams of agony, Schneider
filled me in on everything involving your
case. I know about the triplets, I know
it’s a high-risk pregnancy.
JACK
This is a bad joke, right?
DOCTOR K
It’s not, unfortunately. I’ll get right
to your first concern - I’m seventy-three
years old. I don’t run wind sprints as
fast as I used to, but my faculties are
otherwise completely in tact. There are
days I wish they weren’t, because then I
would retire and spend the rest of my
days doing something more glamorous than
pulling eight pound objects from women’s
vaginas. But until then, I keep coming
here every day.
(then)
I am aware that I am a complete stranger
and this is the biggest moment of your
life. But I am the best of the best and
I swear on the life of my own children
and grandchildren that I am up for the
task.
He stops, smiles.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
Now, which one of you is pregnant?
They stare at him in silence.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
Now that was a bad joke.
(then)
Would you lie back for me, Dear?
Rebecca and Jack share a concerned look.
With no other choice, Rebecca lies back.
INT. SOUND STAGE - DAY
A MULTI-CAMERA sitcom sound stage, the AUDIENCE is full.
KEVIN (our sitcom star) is handed a baby by a gruff
FEMALE STAGE MANAGER.
Here you go.

STAGE MANAGER

16.
KEVIN
(re: baby)
Which one?
STAGE MANAGER

Baby 2.
Dammit.

KEVIN
We can’t use Baby 3 for this?

STAGE MANAGER
Baby 3 is on break. You want Baby 1?
KEVIN
No, Baby 1 is the worst.

Yeah.

STAGE MANAGER
(nod)
Baby 1 is a douche.

Kevin takes the baby.
to the audience.

Out in front, a WARM-UP GUY talks

WARM-UP GUY
Now, remember where we left off, Guys!
Our favorite Man-ny is babysitting, and
the baby has been crying steadily for
three hours. And remember, when
something tickles that funny bone what do
you do?
A HUGE GUFFAW!!!!

Kevin watches, disgusted.

WARM-UP GUY (CONT’D)
I think we’re ready. Director John, you
handsome bastard, take it away.
DIRECTOR JOHN (not handsome) calls out:
DIRECTOR JOHN
Dim the lights. Cue the baby crying.
Speakers BLARE in a clearly fake BABY CRYING.
DIRECTOR JOHN (CONT’D)
And... action.
ON STAGE
Kevin tries comforting/rocking the “crying” baby.
KEVIN
Okay, come on, Kid, you think you might
stop crying sometime this century?

17.
An EXPLOSION OF AUDIENCE LAUGHTER rocks the stage.
is momentarily confused. Was that even a joke?

Kevin

He tries to stay in the scene.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
(to baby)
How can I help? What would Mommy do?
Would she breast-feed? Would that make
you stop crying? You want to breast-feed?
Holding the baby with one arm, Kevin removes his T-shirt.
The audience begins HOOTING and WHISTLING.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
(to baby)
C’mon, kid, work with me. Take my boob
and shut up.
Kevin presses the baby to his chest. The audience is
ROLLING. Kevin can’t take it, breaks character.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, can we cut for a second?
The warm-up guy steps back in front of the audience.
WARM-UP GUY
Little technical difficulty gang, who
wants a T-shirt!?
The crowd goes ape-shit.
BACK ON STAGE
A SHOWRUNNER named CASEY (40’s), approaches Kevin. Casey
is wearing a ball-cap and ill-fitting jeans. In any
other universe, he’d be a schlub. Here he’s the boss.
And a zillionaire.
CASEY
(already annoyed)
What’s up?
KEVIN
I know we talked about this, and I know
I’m being a pain in the ass, but now that
you see it... don’t you think this a
little ridiculous, taking my shirt off to
breast-feed?
I agree.

CASEY

18.

You do?

KEVIN

CASEY
That you’re being a pain in the ass.
we please shoot?

Can

Kevin smiles politely, tries again.
KEVIN
I’m just trying to understand... does my
character actually think the baby will
breast-feed from a man? Are we saying
the Man-ny is mentally retarded, because
if so I’ll start doing a voice.
CASEY
He’s being funny.
KEVIN
For who? He’s alone in a house with a
crying baby.
CASEY
They laughed at the joke, Kevin.
KEVIN
They laugh at anything!
instructed to laugh.

They’ve been

He steps out to the audience, COMMANDS:
KEVIN (CONT’D)
Everyone laugh on “Hitler!”
(then)
Hitler!
He cues the crowd, and they EXPLODE in laughter.
CASEY
Kevin, I know you care.
about this character.
Thank yo--

I know you care

KEVIN

CASEY
I also know you’re a thirty-something
actor who’s biggest previous role was a
three episode arc on “Nashville.” You’re
making thirty thousand dollars an
episode. Say the line, or find another
job.
(MORE)

19.
CASEY (CONT'D)
Because trust me when I tell you that I
will have you replaced with Ryan
Phillippe, or Ryan Gosling, or Ryan
Reynolds, or any handsome Ryan by the
time you get to your car. And believe
me: my ratings will go up.
Casey walks off.
KEVIN
(calling after)
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.
CASEY
(calling back)
No, he wouldn’t, Kevin.

Remember that.

Kevin thinks, SIGHS, turns to the stage manager:
KEVIN
Give me the baby.
STAGE MANAGER
They pulled Baby 2. It’s Baby 1 now.
Kevin looks down at the baby.
Baby 1 makes a face at him.
EXT. SUBURBAN SOCCER FIELD - DAY (NEW JERSEY)
Randall (our slick treadmill-desk NYC guy) wears a
BASEBALL CAP and TRACK GEAR.
In front of him, a group of SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRLS run up and
down a soccer field, en masse, chasing the ball.
Randall focuses on one little GIRL (ANNIE, 6), currently
sitting in the middle of the field braiding another
GIRL’S HAIR.
RANDALL
C’mon, Annie! Go get the ball, Hon!
Annie turns, beaming, WAVES at her father.
Hi Daddy!

ANNIE

The flock of girls run right past her.
with the task at hand.

She continues

20.
A sophisticated BLACK WOMAN (30’s), stands back to back
with Randall. This is Randall’s wife, BETH.
BETH
(not looking)
How’s she doing?
RANDALL
I think she’s saving it for the second
half.
(then)
How’s about her?
Beth is simultaneously watching 8-YEAR-OLD BOYS play on
the adjacent field.
On that field, a TOMBOY GIRL (8) is dominating.
ELBOWS A BOY in a stomach, dribbles past him.

She

BETH
Four boys crying and counting.
RANDALL
That’s our little bull dyke.
She smiles.
Switch?
Switch.

RANDALL (CONT’D)
BETH

The rotate, still back to back, now watching the other
game.
BETH (CONT’D)

Is that--?
RANDALL
A French braid, yes.
Beth nods.
BETH
(re: French braid)
Over, under, back through, Baby!
focused.

Stay

Randall LAUGHS. They sit in contented silence, watching
their two very different little girls play soccer.
Beth reaches back, takes Randall’s hand.

21.
This is a solid couple.
I love this.

A rock solid family.
BETH (CONT’D)

RANDALL
Can we freeze them like this? Just
freeze time, freeze everything?
BETH
I feel like that guy who invented the
Tesla has to be able to figure it out.
RANDALL

Yeah.
A long beat, then:
I found him.
Beth whips around.

RANDALL (CONT’D)
My father.

They’re finally face to face.
BETH

When?
Last week.
Last week!?

RANDALL
BETH
And you didn’t tell me?

RANDALL
Don’t be mad.
I’m mad.

RANDALL

Damn.
Yeah.
A beat.

BETH

Damn.

BETH

Randall confesses.
RANDALL
I hired a guy. It cost about $1500. I
paid for it on the Amex, you’re going to
see it. The personal Amex, not the
business Amex-BETH
I don’t care about the Amex.

22.

I know.

RANDALL

A beat.
So...
Elon Musk.
Huh?

BETH
RANDALL
BETH

RANDALL
I couldn’t think of the guy’s name who
invented the Tesla. It was driving me
crazy.
Randall.

BETH

Randall SIGHS.
RANDALL
I was turning thirty-six and I just
figured that if I didn’t do it now...
(then)
He’s seventy-two years old and lives in
Philadelphia. I got his picture and an
address.
BETH
So are you going to-No.
Why not?

RANDALL
BETH

RANDALL
She was a crack addict who died during
childbirth. He was the guy who left me
at a fire station a few weeks later,
probably because he couldn’t think of
anything more cliche.
(then)
I already have parents. Good ones.
BETH
So why did you find him?

23.
RANDALL
I don’t know, Beth. I really don’t know.
That hangs there.
On the BOYS FIELD, Tess is standing over a fallen
goalkeeper, war-dancing over him like she’s Ray Lewis.
Randall watches her, thinks.
EXT. LOS ANGELES DUPLEX - EVENING
Kate (heavyset twin) EXITS, carrying a LOAD of junk food.
She heads to a curbside GARBAGE CAN and dumps it.
She looks into the garbage can.
KATE’S POV
A bin full of chips, carbs, and trans-fats. It looks
relatively untouched and, to Kate, still appetizing.
BACK TO KATE
Contemplating.
She turns, spots a woman SCOOPING her dog’s recent shit
into a bag. Kate approaches her.
You mind?

KATE

She takes the bag of dogshit from the woman and empties
it into the garbage, on top of the junk food.
Mission accomplished, she gets in her car and drives off.
INT. MEETING ROOM - EVENING
A standard looking SUPPORT GROUP MEETING.
case... a WEIGHT WATCHERS MEETING.

In this

Most of the people in the semi-circle range from slightly
overweight to obese.
Kate falls somewhere in the middle.
A heavy and slightly messianic GROUP LEADER named TANYA
runs the meeting:

24.
TANYA
...and so, when I lost the weight, I said
to myself: “Tanya, you have done what you
set out to do. Now you have to help lead
others, so they can get skinny like you.”
The room CLAPS.
Kate tilts her head, looks at Tanya’s chubby CANKLES.
She ain’t exactly skinny.
Kate’s eye catches that of a HEAVYSET MAN across from her
(TOBY, 40’s).
He raises an amused brow at Kate.
TANYA (CONT’D)
Now who wants to share?
We meet the rest of the group in quick SNAPSHOTS:
- We meet a FAT COUPLE - MARSHA AND PAUL:
MARSHA
Every time I’m going on a diet, he
sabotages me.
PAUL
(exhausted)
I don’t sabotage you, Marsha.
MARSHA
Than why’d you order the creme brulee the
other night, huh?
PAUL
I wanted dessert!
A beat.
MARSHA
YOU’RE A BALD ASSHOLE, PAUL!
PAUL
Jesus, Marsha!
Kate and Toby share a look of bemused horror.

This is

- Next we meet the NOT-REALLY-FAT RICH GIRL:
NOT-REALLY-FAT RICH GIRL
Look, I know I don’t have the same issues
as everyone here. I recognize that.

NOT-REALLY-FAT RICH GIRL
But you guys don’t know what it’s like
looking like me and carrying around that
extra seven pounds in my midsection.
Toby mimes BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT.

Kate smiles.

- A HEAVY WOMAN rattles on and on:
HEAVY WOMAN
...and then there was my mom, who never
let us eat pizza. So now, of course, if
I see pizza, I just have to eat the whole
pizza. I don’t know, if this doesn’t
work I might just get the surgery.
Staple my stomach and-A LAUGH accidentally escapes from Toby.

Everyone turns.

TOBY
I’m so sorry.
(then)
I was just picturing that stapler.
Everyone stares at him.
TOBY (CONT’D)
Totally inappropriate, so sorry.
(then, to woman)
I’m way fatter than you if it means
anything.
(then)
My therapist says I use humor to deflect.
Tanya turns her focus on Toby.
TANYA
And what is your issue with food, Sir?
TOBY
Well, mainly that I eat too much of it.
TANYA
And why do you think that is?
TOBY
Um, I’m not sure. It’s like... sometimes
I think, “I’m hungry.” That happens a
lot. Then I eat. Then I feel less
hungry?
(then)
Does anyone else have that?
Everyone just stares at him.

26.
But Kate smiles. If it’s possible to fall in love at
first sarcasm, it’s just happened.
INT. MEETING ROOM - LATER
The support group has lined up in front of a SCALE.

Hi.

TOBY (O.S.)

She turns.
TOBY (CONT’D)
They hate me.
KATE
You kind of crossed the line.
You smiled.

TOBY

KATE
I live across the line.
He smiles.
Toby.
Kate.

TOBY
KATE

TOBY
Want to be fat friends?
Sure.

KATE

(then)
But I’m going to lose the weight.
TOBY
I’m probably not.
Okay.

KATE

(then)
But I can’t fall for a fat person right
now.

Kate

27.

Okay.

TOBY

(then)
I guess I’ll lose the weight then.
They turn back forward and prepare to weigh in.
But now they’re both smiling.
INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM - LATER
Rebecca is “in labor.” It’s not top-of-lungs-screaming
labor yet, but it’s definitely more intense.
Jack coaches her through a contraction.
JACK
Deep breath, Bec. There you go.
you go. Almost over...
It settles.

There

He wipes the sweat from her forehead.

REBECCA
Baby, I’m sorry for everything I say in
the next two hours. I mean none of it.
JACK
You’ll mean some of it.
REBECCA
Very little of it.
Fair enough.
They smile, in rhythm.

JACK
Jack wipes her forehead.

DOCTOR K (O.S.)
I’m almost glad Schneider’s appendix
burst. I like you two.
They look up.

Doctor K is standing behind them.

He pulls up a CHAIR.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
Because I’m new here, I thought we might
have a little conversation now. Before
things get more intense.
He sits beside the bed.

28.
REBECCA
I’d like that. You said you have
grandchil-DOCTOR K
Not that kind of conversation.
Rebecca goes quiet.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
I know Dr. Schneider talked to you about
the positioning of the babies, and how
complicated this delivery might get. It
will be best for the babies if they come
out the old fashioned way, but I’ll be
prepared to go in if necessary. What I
need to know is this: if things get
complicated-JACK
I’m sorry, no. We are not having this
conversation.
Jack--

REBECCA

JACK
We are not having this conversation
because it’s not going to happen. We are
walking out of this hospital with three
healthy babies and one healthy wife. I
have three cribs at our new home that we
bought specifically for our three
children to grow up in. My mother has
already knitted three Fearsome Threesome
onesies. Three of them. And she’s a
slow, no-talent knitter. It’s also my
birthday today, by the way, which tends
to be a pretty good day in our house, a
day where I get pretty lucky. So I need
everyone in this room to believe me when
I say that only good things are happening
today. Actually, no, I don’t want you to
just believe it. I want you to know it.
(to Rebecca)
Do you know it, Baby?
REBECCA
My God, I love you.
(then)
Yes, I know it.
Jack turns to Doctor K.

29.
JACK
Do you know it?
Doctor K thinks.
DOCTOR K
I know I like you. So let’s start there
and get you what you want.
Jack and Rebecca share a smile.

Doctor K looks concerned.

INT. RANDALL’S OFFICE (NYC) - DAY
Randall stares at the PHOTOS of his two GIRLS on his desk.
Then he turns his attention to the computer...
...and that singular PHOTO of his BIOLOGICAL FATHER.
Randall hits a button on his office phone.
RANDALL
(into phone)
Hey, clear my afternoon?
But you--

ASSISTANT (O.S.)

RANDALL
(already standing)
Thanks.
EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - LATER
Randall drives his black Mercedes AMG 63 against traffic,
out of New York City.
EXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE - LATER
He heads from Northern Jersey through Southern Jersey and
onto...
EXT. DELAWARE TURNPIKE - LATER
Which gets you into Pennsylvania, and eventually onto I-76
and into...

30.
EXT. PHILADELPHIA - LATER
A city where driving just a few city blocks can land you
in a completely different economic stratosphere:
- Rittenhouse Square is where the money is.
- Then there are all the upscale universities, which for
some reason border...
- West Philadelphia. One of the grittiest and grimiest
inner cities in America.
And it is on the GRITTIEST BLOCK OF ALL, that Randall
(using his GPS) parks his car, takes in the unkempt
apartment, and heads to the front door.
EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
KNOCK, KNOCK.

Randall bangs on the door.

Comin’.

VOICE (O.S.)

ON RANDALL
Breathing hard, he’s not composed.
KNOCKS again, louder.

Not himself.

He

VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I said I was coming.
The door opens.
Before Randall stands his biological father, WILLIAM HILL
(72). The same man from the picture.
But in person, William is even older.
He’s seen better days.

More beaten up.

WILLIAM
Can I help yo-Randall launches in.
RANDALL
My name is Randall Peasing. I am your
biological son. Thirty-six years ago you
left me -- no, hold on, let me say this thirty-six years ago you left me at the
front door of a fire station. Don’t
worry, I am not here because I want
anything from you. Don’t need a hug,
don’t need any money.
(MORE)

31.
RANDALL (CONT'D)
I was raised by two incredible parents, I
have a lights out family of my own, and
that car you see parked out front of your
house cost 104,000 dollars and I bought
it for cash. I bought it for cash
because I felt like it, and because I can
do shit like that. Yeah, you see, I
turned out pretty alright, which might
surprise a lot of folks considering the
fact that thirty-six years ago my life
started with you leaving me on a fire
station doorstep with nothing but a ratty
blanket and a crap-filled diaper. I came
here today so I could look you in the
eye, say that to you, and then get back
in my fancy-ass car and finally prove to
myself, and to you, and to my family who
loves me, that I didn’t need a fucking
thing from you, even after I knew who you
were.
A beat, then:
WILLIAM
Would you like to come in?
RANDALL

Okay.
They head inside.

INT. WILLIAM’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
We take in the apartment. There’s a beaten armchair,
which sits in front of an outdated television.
There’s a noticeable lack of life and photographs in this
place.
IN THE SMALL KITCHEN
William places a cup of instant coffee in front of
Randall.
Take milk?
No.
Good.

WILLIAM
RANDALL

WILLIAM
Don’t have any.

32.
They sit there in silence.
WILLIAM (CONT’D)
You look like me, I think. Like I used
to look. You think?
Randall SHRUGS, indifferent and forcing his “pissed.”
RANDALL
So is there something you want to say to
me, cause otherwise I really need to get
going?
William looks confused.
WILLIAM
You want me to say something?
RANDALL
I told you I don’t want anything from
you.
WILLIAM
But you’re here.
RANDALL
Just to tell you that.
WILLIAM
Well, I’ve been told.
A longer beat.
RANDALL
You know what, if you’re just going to
sit here making excuses-WILLIAM
Didn’t make any excuses.
RANDALL
Because there’s nothing you can say-WILLIAM
Didn’t say anything for just that reason.
Another long beat.
WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Seems to me you want me to try and make
amends so you can say “screw you” and
storm outta here.

33.
RANDALL
That’s ridiculous.
Okay.
A beat.

WILLIAM

William thinks.
WILLIAM (CONT’D)
I’d like to say I remember your mom, but
I barely do. Lived on the streets then.
Crack, heroin. I remember her dying.
Remember there was a baby. I’d like to
say I remember leaving you at a fire
station, but I don’t. Not an excuse. In
fact, it probably tells you something
about me that I don’t remember. I do
like fire stations though, so that sounds
like something I’d do if I had to do
something, you know? Anyway, I don’t
know if that’s what you’re looking for,
but either way, you can be sure this life
of mine has been punishment enough for
the things I’ve done.
RANDALL
If you think I’m going to forgive you-I don’t.

WILLIAM

RANDALL
You were right, I did just want to say
screw you and storm out of here.
Go ‘head.
Screw you.
Yep.

WILLIAM
RANDALL

Randall turns, storms out.

A moment passes, he re-enters.

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
You want to meet your grandchildren?
RANDALL
I’ll get my coat.

Great scene for you by the way.
KEVIN
Right? I’ve been asking for a dramatic
monologue for a year now, and he finally
gave me one.

When the prick tries, he can really

Ted smiles.
TED DANSON
Well, I’ll see you out on the field.
Break a leg, Kid.
Ted Danson EXITS.

We hear the crowd GO NUTS.

Kevin takes a deep breath, steadies himself, and heads
out...
ON STAGE
Kevin ENTERS to applause, sits down on the set’s couch.

DIRECTOR JOHN
Okay, everyone settle, quiet please.
And... ACTION.
Ted Danson steps into the room, PULLING A SUITCASE.
TED DANSON
Guess I’ll get going.
Kevin sits there, sulking in silence.
TED DANSON (CONT’D)
Okay, well, lovely seeing you as always.
Let me know if you get that big promotion
to babysitter. Or is babysitter actually
a demotion from nanny?
Good one.

KEVIN

TED DANSON
Oh for God’s sake, I’m trying to make
light of the situation.
KEVIN
That’s what you do.
I’m sorry?

TED DANSON

KEVIN
That’d be a first.
Son--

My lightweight Dad.

You being sorry.

TED DANSON

KEVIN
No, don’t son me. Just go.
(intense)
Get the hell out of here.
Suddenly, you can hear a pin drop. Casey (showrunner)
stands up behind the monitors, intrigued.
Kevin laughs to himself.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
“Son,” you called me? What a joke. I
see that pretty clearly now. You know
why?
(MORE)

36.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
Because this stupid job - my babysitting
job you get such pleasure mocking? I
look at that little girl and I’d do
anything for her - trains, bullets, I’d
jump in front of any of them for her.
And she’s not even mine. And for you to
just walk in and out of my life like you
have the past thirty years.
(then)
I’ll never understand it. I’ll never
understand you.
(then)
I’m too old to be hurt by you anymore.
I’m too tired. Just get the hell out of
here.
They stand there in silence until... Ted SIGHS, and EXITS.
A long beat of silence as the camera PUSHES IN tight on
Kevin until...
And CUT!

DIRECTOR JOHN

And slowly... the crowd goes ape-shit, recognizing
they’ve just seen something special.
Kevin takes a sheepish bow.

Casey approaches.

CASEY
Good stuff, Kevin. Really, really great,
man. Now let’s just take a quick whack
at the alt pass-What?

KEVIN
Really?

CASEY
Kevin, we talked about this. I liked it
too - hell, I wrote it - but we need to
have the lighter option.
KEVIN
I just don’t see why I’d be cracking
jokes during a confrontation with my
estranged father.
Kevin.
Kevin shuts his mouth.

CASEY
He looks to Ted Danson who shrugs.

37.
TED DANSON
I’m just here for the overpaid guest star
gig.
Ted heads to his mark. Casey waves a finger in the air
at the director (”let’s run it again”).
Kevin looks out...
AT THE CROWD
TOURISTS abound. PIZZA and T-SHIRTS are being handed out
to keep them in their seats. The T-shirts feature a
picture of the shirtless Manny.
KEVIN
(announcing)
Okay everyone, we’re gonna do the same
scene again, but funny this time.
The crowd LAUGHS. Kevin looks over at Casey, back behind
the monitors with WRITERS. They’re all eating, laughing,
could care less.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
(loudly)
Because that’s what you all want from
this asinine show, right? You want to
laugh? To laugh at the idiot Manny?
Some LAUGHS. Some chatter. Slowly, people realize this
isn’t a “bit” and start filming Kevin on their iPhones.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
That guy over there? The fatass in the
baseball cap he uses to cover his bald
spot? He doesn’t think you’ll reach for
any fruit unless it’s hanging so low you
can step on it. And you know what, he’s
probably right. It’s not his fault this
show is this bad. It’s not the network’s
fault for putting it on. It’s your
fault. It’s your fault for demanding so
little of us that we allow ourselves to
settle. Shame on you for watching this
thing. Shame on you for laughing at this
crap. Shame on all of you.
He rips off his mic, turns to Casey.
KEVIN (CONT’D)
Ryan Gosling may not do this crap, but
neither will I. I quit.

Jack STANDS, terrified.

DOCTOR K
Rebecca’s vitals are good. She’ll be
asleep for a little while, but she’s
doing fine and we are monitoring her
closely.
Jack nods, relieved.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
(steady)
We lost the third baby, Jack. I’m very
sorry. The second child is a girl, very
strong. The third child was a boy, but
the umbilical cord was cutting off his
oxygen and he was stillborn. There’s
nothing anyone could have done.
Jack stares ahead blankly.
JACK
I’m sorry, I’m not processing anything.
My wife?

47.
DOCTOR K
(calm, once again)
Is fine. She’ll be awake soon. You have
two beautiful healthy children, Jack. A
boy and a girl. But we did lose the
third child.
Jack sits down, overwhelmed and not sure what to do with
any of this.
Then he stands.
JACK
I need to be with my wife.
DOCTOR K
You will be. She needs to sleep now, but
soon.
(then)
C’mon, sit.
Jack hesitates, then sits.

Doctor K sits next to him.

They sit in silence for a long beat.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
Okay if I keep you company for a second?
Jack nods, blankly.

A long beat of silence.

DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
Okay if I try and say something
meaningful?
Jack nods again, blankly.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
I lost my wife last year. Cancer. It’s
why I still work so much, at my age.
Trying to pass the time, I guess.
Jack stares off into the distance. Doctor K looks at
him, checking on him, and continues.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
We were married fifty-three years. Five
children, eleven grandkids. But we lost
our very first child during the delivery.
I was just twenty-two. It’s why I went
into pediatrics, truth be told. Wanted
to do my part to prevent the same thing
from happening to others, when I could.
To help people get through it, when I
couldn’t.
(MORE)

48.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
I’ve spent five decades delivering
babies. More babies than I can count.
But all these years later not a single
day goes by I don’t think of the child I
lost.
This sits there.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
I’m an old man now. I always say that
when you stop recognizing your reflection
in the mirror, that’s when it’s time to
start reflecting.
Jack smiles just a little.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
I like to think that because of the child
I lost, because of the path he sent me
on, I’ve saved countless other babies. I
like to think that maybe one day you’ll
be an old man like me, talking a younger
man’s ear off, explaining to him how you
took the sourest lemon life has to offer,
and turned it into something resembling
lemonade. If you can do that, you’ll
still be bringing home three children
from this hospital, just maybe not the
way you planned.
Doctor K shrugs.
DOCTOR K (CONT’D)
Don’t know if that’s meaningful or
senile, but felt it should be said. Your
wife will be asleep for a while. Go see
your babies. They’re excited to meet
their father.
(then)
I think they may have gotten a good one.
Doctor K STANDS.

Jack looks up at him.

JACK
Maybe you’ll come over for something
resembling lemonade one day.
DOCTOR K
I’d like that very much.
He pats Jack on the shoulder and leaves him, lost in
thought.

INT. RANDALL’S HOME OFFICE - LATER
It’s late. William stands in Randall’s elegant study,
looking at FRAMED FAMILY PHOTOS.
Randall ENTERS.
RANDALL
Sorry, just had to put the girls down.
William picks up a picture.
WILLIAM
These people, they’re-RANDALL
My parents. My adopted... my parents. My
father passed away few years back. My mom
still lives in the house I grew up in.
WILLIAM
You were with them your whole life?
RANDALL
From the start.
(then)
A fireman found me. He took me to the
hospital and they were there. They said
it felt meant to be. Just one of those
lucky breaks, I guess.
William shakes his head, sadly.
WILLIAM
A fire station. What a thing to have
done.
William puts down the photo.

Silence.

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
I should get going. It was kind of
you... to be kind to me.
RANDALL
The girls enjoyed meeting you.
can have you by once in a--

Maybe we

WILLIAM
Oh, I don’t think that’s necessary.
RANDALL
No pressure, I just--

50.
WILLIAM
It’s just that I’m dying is all.
Probably best for everyone if this is a
one-time thing.
Randall looks up, surprised.
You’re sick?

RANDALL

WILLIAM
Dying, not sick. Sick was months ago.
I’m toward the end, fortunately.
Silence.
RANDALL
I don’t know what to say.
WILLIAM
Nothing to be said. I only tell you now
so you know where I’ve gone, when I’m
gone.
(then)
It was a kindness you’ve shown me,
letting me see them. Your dad must have
been very proud of you.
And with that, William starts putting on his tattered
coat.
To his complete surprise, Randall’s heart breaks.
INT. KATE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Kate, Toby, and Kevin sit on the couch. They are
drinking wine (Kevin is chugging from the bottle).
KATE
I cannot believe I am drinking these
calories.
KEVIN
I just torpedoed my career, Sis.
spare a hundred calories for me.
KATE
Hundred fifty.
Kate and Toby share a smile.

You can

TOBY
Hundred fifty.

51.
TOBY
(then, confused)
So you two are twins?
KATE
Schwarzenegger and DeVito, in the flesh.
KEVIN
Oh my God, what have I done!? I’m an
unemployable thirty-five year old actor.
KATE
We turned thirty-six, Kev.
KEVIN
Oh God, that’s right! Late thirties!
How did I get here!?
(then, to Toby)
Do you remember-KATE
Do not tell him about Christa McAuliffe,
Kevin.
KEVIN
She was gonna be the first teacher in-Kevin!

KATE

Kevin chugs more wine.
KEVIN
What am I going to do, Sis?
Broadway?
Can’t sing.
Porn?
Yeah, maybe.

KATE

Kate shares a concerned look with Toby.

She puts down

KATE
Kevin: do you remember what Dad would
always say when something crappy happened
to us?
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
We are in the room with all the newborn babies who need
extra monitoring.
TIGHT ON JACK
On the other side of the windowed glass, looking in.
He focuses on TWO LITTLE ONES, a BOY and a GIRL.
KATE (V.O.)
Whenever we’d get down, whenever we felt
like life wasn’t going our way?
A MAN (40’s) steps up beside Jack.
MAN
Which one’s yours?
Those two.
Congrats!

JACK
MAN
Twins, wow.

Jack flinches on “twins.”
JACK
(covering)
Thanks.
(then)
Which one’s yours?
MAN
None of ‘em, actually. Strangest damn
thing. Someone left a poor little baby
at my station. I didn’t know what to do
so I brought him here.
Huh?
We REVERSE to the other side of the window and see that
the man is in a FIREMAN outfit.
WTF?

53.
As the fireman points out a little African-American baby
to Jack...
We take in other visitors walking through the hospital.
It’s the first time in Jack’s story that we’ve been
anywhere outside an unfurnished bedroom or standard issue
hospital room.
And from the wardrobes, and from the outdated phones and
technology, we suddenly realize that our main story Jack and Rebecca’s story - has been taking place on
Jack’s birthday... but in 1979.
We realize that the two babies Jack is looking at are
Kevin and Kate. That the baby the fireman has found is
the one that William Hill long ago abandoned - Randall.
INT. KATE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
As Kate finishes...
KATE
C’mon, Kev, you remember. What was that
thing he always said? About the lemons?
There’s no lemon so sour...
Kevin smiles.
KEVIN
...you can’t make something resembling
lemonade.
And as Doctor K’s original words to Jack land...
We FLASH around our various stories...
- Randall and Beth set up William with TOWELS in a guest
bedroom.
- Toby helps Kate cover a passed out Kevin with a
blanket. And when they’re close, before she can resist,
Toby leans in and plants a big kiss on her lips.
Good.

TOBY
Now that’s out of the way.

- And finally...
- Jack sits next to Rebecca in her hospital room, as she
slowly wakes up.
He talks to her.

She cries.

They hold each other.

54.
Doctor K watches them from the doorway, leaves them be.
And finally...
INT. BEDROOM - WEEKS LATER
We are back where we first started, in Jack and Rebecca’s
still unfurnished new bedroom.
In front of that single bare mattress rest THREE
BASSINETS.
Jack and Rebecca stand in front of them, holding hands,
looking at their new family.
Each bassinet holds a month old BABY: two white, one
black. Kevin, Kate, and Randall.
They all wear poorly-knitted onesies which read:
“The Fearsome Threesome.”
THE END.

A quick note to the reader: The time-twist here will be
unnoticeable in execution. Yes, it’s a narrative trick,
but every setting in Jack and Rebecca’s story has been
carefully constructed so that - when shot - you won’t
notice that we’re not in present day: the unfurnished new
bedroom in the quaint 70’s style house, Rebecca’s bad
maternity wear, the timeless standard issue hospital room
(and doctor/nurse uniforms), even the Terrible Towel that
seemed vintage but was actually current back then.
Because of where the scenes take place, the 1979 of it
all won’t be hard to disguise, but will hold up to
scrutiny in second viewing.
In series, we will follow the lives of these identically
aged people... with fun coming from the fact that one of
the stories happens to be the story of the parents of our
other main characters.
Thank you for listening.
Love,
M Night Fogelman
