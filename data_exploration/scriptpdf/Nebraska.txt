EXT. BILLINGS, MONTANA - LAUREL ROAD - DAY

A MAN in his 70s walks along a narrow stretch of grass
separating a busy road from a railroad yard.
The man walks purposefully, despite the hesitant gait and
clouded eyes of a longtime alcoholic.

Now a bit dazed and slowed by fatigue, the man walks past a

DAVID GRANT - 40 - sits in a recliner in a sparsely-furnished

of Mountain Dew. The doorbell rings.
He gets up and opens the door.

NOËL
Get married, break up, I don’t
know. Let’s do both. Let’s just
do something.

The phone rings. David and Noël wait in silence as the
machine eventually picks up.
KATE (ON PHONE)
Pick up or call me back right now.
It’s your father -- he’s gone
crazy.
Oh, shit.

DAVID

He runs to pick up the phone.
Hi, Mom.

Noël starts for the door.

DAVID (CONT’D)
I’m here.

KATE (ON PHONE)
David, it’s your mother.
DAVID
That’s why I said, “Hi, Mom.”
KATE (ON PHONE)
I don’t know what I’m going to do
with him. I’m going to put him in
a goddamned nursing home is what
I’m going to do. I’m too old for
this.

As Kate continues, David waves a weak goodbye to Noël.

In addition to general confusion, Woody is deaf in one ear.
DAVID
So you told the sheriff you were
walking to... Nebraska?

WOODY
That’s right. To get my million
dollars.
DAVID
What million dollars?
WOODY
I won a million dollars.
He pulls a crinkled letter from his jacket pocket, which he
unfolds and labors to read.
WOODY (CONT’D)
“We are now authorized to pay one
million dollars to Mr. Woodrow T.
Grant of Billings, Montana.”

Let me see.
Woody hands David the letter.

Your mother won’t take me.

KATE GRANT awaits them wearing a faded floral housecoat. The
house has a tired, 70s-era décor. David puts his basket in
the laundry room at one end of the kitchen.
KATE
You dumb cluck. You pretty near
gave me a heart attack!
WOODY
Now just cool your jets.
KATE
This is the second time he’s tried
to sneak out. I never knew the sonof-a-bitch even wanted to be a
millionaire. He should have
thought about that years ago and
worked for it.
DAVID
What would you do with a million
dollars anyway, Dad?
WOODY
Buy a new truck.
DAVID
You can’t drive.
WOODY
I’ll get my license back.
DAVID
Tell me when you do so I can stay
off the road.

I lent it to

DAVID
Who’s Ed Pegram?
WOODY
Guy I knew back in Hawthorne.
DAVID
When did he borrow it?
WOODY

DAVID
That’s almost forty years. He
lives two states away. I’d say he
stole it.
WOODY
That’s why I need a new one.
Woody heads down the hallway.
KATE
Where you off to now?
WOODY
Lyin’ down.
KATE
He even sleeps with that stupid
letter. He’s memorized it word for

memorize anything anymore.

Hey, what’s with this casserole?

KATE
It’s lasagna. It’s still good.
Take it. And take some bananas. I
bought a whole lot of them

nervous. You know what I’d do with
a million dollars -- I’d put him in
a home.

INT. HOME THEATERS PLUS! - DAY

8

David works with a YOUNG COUPLE inside a soundproof DEMO
ROOM. David and the man headbang to a rock anthem. The
woman looks bored.
Soon David leads them back into the showroom.
DAVID
Like I say, you basically just testdrove a Cadillac or Rolls Royce or
whatever. Wasn’t that awesome?
Totally.

MAN

DAVID
But that’s not to say I can’t set
you up with a whole lot more
reasonable speakers that’ll still
blow your mind if you’re worried
the Wilsons are going to set you
back too much. The way they design
speakers anymore, you can’t make a
mistake.
The woman tugs on her boyfriend’s arm.
MAN
Great. I think, uh, I think we
just need to discuss this and get
back to you.
DAVID
Here’s my card. Give me a call
anytime if you have any more
questions.
MAN
Thanks a lot.
DAVID
Excellent, Mark, Janice.

EXT. WOODY AND KATE’S HOUSE - DAY

David gets out of his car and finds his mother near the
garage.
DAVID
Where’d they find him this time?
KATE
Way the hell out on King Avenue by
the Albertson’s. I can’t take it
anymore. Ross is in there trying
to talk some sense into him.
David goes into the -10

engine of a very old Ford pickup. Ross has a sportcoat, tie,
and perfect haircut.
Hi, Dave.

DAVID

WOODY
I’ll get her runnin’.
ROSS
He still thinks he’s going to
Lincoln to get his money.
WOODY
Gotta get there by the 5th.

*

ROSS
Hey Dad, how come you didn’t think
of fixing the truck first or take a
bus? Why’d you just start walking?

*

Woody looks up a moment, thinks about that, then gets back to
work. David leads his brother out of the garage.
DAVID
Don’t pull his chain like that.
The poor guy doesn’t know what’s
going on half the time.
ROSS
I cut the solenoid wire and stuck
it back in. That’ll slow him down.
And Mom’s right -- it’s time to
think about a home. She can’t
handle him anymore. It’s not fair
to her.

*

DAVID
He doesn’t need a nursing home. He
just...the guy just needs something
to live for. That’s all this is
about.
ROSS
Yeah, and it’s pathetic. Seems
like drinking always gave him more
than enough to live for until now.
DAVID
Go easy on the man, okay? He’ll
probably forget all about this in a
day or two.
ROSS
And then it’ll be some other
demented crap, like the infomercial
stuff last year. Mom and I are
looking at reality, and you’d
better start too.

*

10.
ROSS (CONT'D)
A home would be in his best
interest -- which, let’s face it -is more than he ever thought about
with us. He never gave a shit
about you or me.
They peek inside the garage.

Woody remains focused.

DAVID
I saw you anchoring the other
night. Nice job.
Thanks.

ROSS

DAVID
First time in the chair, right?
ROSS
Kelly Ann Castillo called in sick,
so I got to fill in, yeah. And
apparently I didn’t stink up the
place too much, so...
DAVID
Tom Brokaw. The new Tom Brokaw of
Billings.
ROSS
I don’t know about Tom Brokaw
exactly, but you know, yeah, it’s
looking pretty good. I’ve paid my
dues. Plus, looks like Kelly Ann’s
got some kind of bad infection.
Then from inside the garage -KATE
You put that heap of shit on the
road, I swear to God I’ll call the
police!

David notices the time and switches the channel.
ROSS (ON TV)
Billings Chamber of Commerce
director Dee Pomerantz says a new
convention center could bring in
upwards of five million dollars to
the Magic City. But opponents, led
by Councilman Reilly Tilden, claim
the plan is a “Pie in the Big Sky
idea” that will cost taxpayers more
than it’s worth. The Council is
expected to debate the proposal in
Monday’s session. Coming up next,
is it time to pull out that old
umbrella? Debbie Ontiveros has
your soggy work week forecast.

Woody walks down the sidewalk toward the BUS STATION. David

Dad.

Dad!

WOODY
Leave me alone.
David guns the car ahead of Woody, stops and gets out.

Come on.

DAVID
Let me take you home.

WOODY
I’m going to Lincoln if it’s the
last thing I do. I don’t care what
you people think.
DAVID
Listen to me. You didn’t win
anything. It’s a complete scam.
So you’ve got to stop this, okay?
Woody looks at David as though maybe his son is finally
making sense. Then he starts walking again.

His mother spoiled him.

We’ll just be gone a couple of
days. Don’t worry. We’ll be back
before you know it. Why don’t you
just enjoy the time alone? You
always complain about having him
around.
KATE
What about your job?
David gets in the car.
DAVID
I told them I was sick.
KATE
Sick in the head. I’m going to

DOCTOR
Considering it’s a pretty bad head
wound, his age, and history of
drinking, I think we should keep
him in the hospital a day or so for
observation.
WOODY
I don’t drink.
DAVID
You hear that, Dad? We won’t be
making Lincoln by Friday.
WOODY
We got till Monday.

WOODY
I don’t want to go to Hawthorne.
Why can’t we just go direct to
Lincoln?

DAVID
Because there’s no sense going to
Lincoln over the weekend. I’ll get
you there Monday morning. Anyway,

When I was a boy, my brothers and I

This economy has just tore up

Yeah, I’m in the home theater and

UNCLE RAY
Cole here did some jail.

I will not allow that kind of

So how long’d it take you to get

DAVID
I don’t know. We got sort of

where Dad had his little accident.
BART
But how long total?
DAVID
Oh, couple of days, I guess.
BART
From Billings? How far’s that?
DAVID
Probably about 750 miles.
COLE
It took you two days to drive 750
miles? What are you driving, a
dump truck or something?
DAVID
It’s a Subaru. Outback.

Hell, I drove up from Dallas one

her a few steps away from Woody.
DAVID
Listen, go easy, okay? You and I
both know it’s not about the money.
It’s about...you know, how much
longer is he going to be around -at least semi-coherently? What’s
the harm in letting him have his
little fantasy for a couple more
days?
KATE
You and Ross always fretting over
your father. What about me? How
about taking me out to see my
sister in Eau Claire? Your father
doesn’t even know what the hell’s
going on around him half the time.

KATE
That’s Woody’s mother Sara. She
hated me because she wanted him to
marry someone who’d milk the cows,
but I said I ain’t fiddlin’ with no
cow titties. I’m a city girl.
The good lord did not do Sara any
favors in the looks department.
More a man’s face than a woman’s,
really. I was pretty, so she
resented me. You knew your mother
was ugly, right, Woody?

Woody looks at Kate, then stares at his mother’s grave.
DAVID
How did she die?
KATE
Saw herself in the mirror one day!
No, cancer.

And there’s the old Swede Tolf. A
good man, your grandpa. Never said
much. That farm just ruined him.

You’re lucky I took you away from
there.
Woody nods slightly as he looks at his father’s leaf-covered
grave.
KATE (CONT’D)
That’s Woody’s brother David. You
were named after him. He died of
scarlet fever when he was only two.
Woody slept in the same bed with
him but never got it.

Well, I’m very pleased to meet you.
Your father is certainly quite the
celebrity around here. Did Parker

DAVID
That’s what I came to tell you
about. Dad didn’t win any lottery

little confused about something he
got in the mail, and it’s gotten
way out of hand.

Water under the bridge. Don’t get
me wrong, I married a wonderful man
-- we ran this paper together until
he died -- had three children,
eight grandchildren. I’ve got no
complaints.
DAVID
Was he drinking back then?
PEG NAGY
Of course he was. It happens early
around here. There isn’t much else
to do. Nowadays, of course, it’s
not just booze but all that other
stuff. For Woody it got bad after
Korea. He had a hard time over
there.
DAVID
I thought he was just a mechanic.
PEG NAGY
Oh, he was, for the army planes.
But he was shot down while being
transferred. You knew that, right?
David looks at her with a puzzled expression.

PEG NAGY
Your dad was never much of a
talker, and when he came back he
hardly said a word. But always
very kind. People took advantage
of him. He couldn’t turn down a
favor.

DAVID
Well, now that everyone thinks he’s
a millionaire, he’s a big hero
around here.
PEG NAGY
I’m sorry I can’t print that he is,
but I won’t print that he isn’t
either. I’ll just do a little
story on him and Kate stopping
through town.

DAVID
Hard to imagine you and my mother
fighting over the same man.
PEG NAGY
I knew I didn’t have a chance
anyway.
Yeah?

They should have meat loaf.

Well, they don’t, so pick something

The WAITRESS appears.
WAITRESS
Are we ready to order?
I knew it.

KATE

DAVID
Dad, do you know what you want?
WOODY
Do you have meat loaf?
Kate rolls her eyes.
WAITRESS
No, I’m sorry, we don’t. That’s
only on the lunch buffet.
WOODY
Chicken then.
WAITRESS
Did you want the fried chicken, or
the flame-broiled chicken breast?
Fried.

WOODY

KATE
He’ll have the flame-broiled.
WAITRESS
And you, ma’am?

I was thinking of having the roast
beef, but now I’m not sure. What

Don’t forget to help yourselves to

She leaves.

Just then -- a new VOICE starts singing.

KATE
Oh my God, that’s Ed Pegram
singing.
They look over and see Ed.

He’s not great, but not bad.

DAVID
Maybe we should go ask for the
compressor.
WOODY
He’ll give it back.
KATE
He always had a nice voice. It was
the only nice thing about that
bastard.
WOODY
He’s all right.
KATE
All right? Did you know he was
always trying to get in my
bloomers?
DAVID
Jesus, Mom, was the whole town
trying to seduce you?

Mom, please don’t talk about that

KATE
(softening)
Oh, you were always such a
sensitive boy. And such a
beautiful boy. Why, when you were
a baby, people used to stop me on
the street and tell me how
beautiful you were. A lot of them
thought you were a girl. Isn’t
that right, Woody -- people used to
stop me on the street to say how
beautiful David was?
I dunno.

WOODY

Ed Pegram pauses singing to make an announcement.
ED PEGRAM
Hey, everybody, we’ve got a
celebrity here -- my old friend and
the rich man you’ve all been
hearing about -- Woody Grant.
Woody, take a bow!
The other diners applaud.

Woody looks confused.

DAVID
Stand up, Dad.
What?

WOODY

KATE
Don’t encourage this nonsense.
DAVID
Dad, stand up. It’s for you.
KATE
Just do it and get it over with.
Woody stands and realizes the growing applause is for him.
He turns to look at everyone, enjoying this once-in-alifetime experience.

Okay, you ham, that’s enough.
She tugs him back down into the booth.
ED PEGRAM
And Kate, I guess that makes you a

a bow too, Katesy-Kate?
Kate rolls her eyes before getting up and going through the
motions. At first polite, she soon allows herself to bask.

Thank you.

DAVID

ED PEGRAM
Heart of gold. No secret, though,
Woody drank quite a bit when we had
the garage. Messed up a lot of
jobs and let a lot of money walk.
He was older than me, kind of like
a big brother, Korea vet, the whole
nine yards. I wanted to show him
some respect, and I loaned him a
ton of dough I never saw again. So
seeing as how he’s come into some
cash lately, some no-foolin’-around
cash he didn’t even have to work
for, seems to me it’d only be fair
to settle up.
DAVID
You want your $800 back?
ED PEGRAM
Woody owes me a lot more than that.

*

53.
DAVID
I’m sorry to break it to you, but
my dad didn’t actually win
anything. It’s all a big
misunderstanding. You know Woody.
You can understand that.
ED PEGRAM
Right, so you’re all headed to
Lincoln to visit the roller-skating
museum. Look, Davey, I really
don’t want to bring a lawyer in on
this.
DAVID
Lawyer? What’s the statute of
limitations on bullshit?
Ed lays an arm on David’s shoulder.
ED PEGRAM
I’m a man with a real strong sense
of right and wrong. And if Woody
hit it rich and I don’t see any of
it, well, that’s wrong. And I will
make it right.
DAVID
Are you threatening my family?
Ed withdraws his arm and grins.
ED PEGRAM
Threatening? No, that would be
wrong. Hey, I’m the victim here.
Just food for thought. Now, if
you’ll excuse me, I got to take a
leak real bad. You know beer -you just rent the stuff.
Ed takes a stand at the ice-filled urinal.

Aunt Betty seems uncomfortable, so Randy takes the lead.
COUSIN RANDY
You may not know it, but Uncle
Woody used to have a lot of money
problems, and family members would
help him out from time to time. So
in light of his good fortune, well,
we thought your family might want
to make things right.

other way around. You were always
having him work on your cars for

Aunt Kate, we’re not asking for
much. Just a token.
KATE
I kept records. The money you gave
him didn’t come close to what you
owed. He couldn’t say no to
anybody, and it ruined him.
AUNT BETTY
I think you’re having a senior
moment here, Kate. Where do you
think all that money come from when
you got a bee in your bonnet to
move to Billings and open a salon?

that’s where! I can’t believe the
nerve of you people. Usually a

Anything you want to say about the

KATE
No, they’re good folks.
Releasing a loud exhale, Ross looks at David and starts
turning the car around.
KATE (CONT’D)
They had some tough times. Lost a
child. Almost went broke, but they
worked hard and saved the farm.
Salt of the earth, the Westendorfs.
They really didn’t deserve you boys
doing that to them.

Why didn’t you tell us that wasn’t

KATE
Hi, George. Hi, Jean. Remember

Oh, sure.

GEORGE WESTENDORF
How you doin’?

KATE
Just fine. We were passing by, so
we thought we’d stop in. Haven’t
been in Hawthorne for a long time.
JEAN WESTENDORF
What are you doing in the back

KATE
Oh, we just thought we’d rest back
here until you showed up.
JEAN WESTENDORF
Would you like to come in?
KATE
Sorry, but we just have time to say
hi and get going.

Hi there, Woody. How’s it goin’?
Fine.

ED PEGRAM
Woody, I always thought we was
friends. Remember, I was the one
who convinced you to stay with
Kate.
Huh?
ED PEGRAM (CONT’D)
Oh yeah, Davey. Your old man was
thinking of getting a divorce
because he was screwing some halfbreed from the reservation.
Thought he was in love. Ain’t that
right, Woody?
Woody stares at the table.
DAVID
When was this?
ED PEGRAM
After Ross was born. Before you.
Hell, if it wasn’t for me, you
probably wouldn’t be here. Back
then divorce was a sin. Now I
guess it’s okay. God must have
changed his mind or something.

Woody slowly approaches to retrieve the letter.

Woody carefully folds the letter and puts it back in his
pocket. Then he walks slowly toward the door as David goes
up to Ed.
After a few moments of staring at Ed, David turns away. Then
he stops, doubles back, and PUNCHES Ed in the face as hard as

Ed falls onto a stool and hugs it as he falls to the floor.
