1. PARK. EXT. DAY.
Salvador and Mercedes, standing in front of a hole in
the ground, it isn’t very deep (about 2 feet).
Everything seems to show that it was Mercedes who dug
it, or someone who was paid and left as soon as he was
finished. Manolo the cat, Salvador’s pet, is lying at
the bottom, in a wicker basket. Salvador pushes the
earth with his foot and it falls on the basket.
Cut.
In the same park. Mercedes is about 50, she has spent
half her life at Salvador’s side, as his assistant in
everything. Even though he no longer works, they keep
in touch.
Mercedes is the closest thing to a family that Salvador
has. Efficient, warm, loyal, special, intelligent and
not at all intrusive. There are no secrets between them
or, if there are, they are minimal and the result of
respect.
Mercedes and Salvador walk sadly through the park in
which the cat’s remains now rest.
MERCEDES
Do you want me to bring you a cat
from Cedillo? Or two, so they’re
company for each other.
SALVADOR
No, I can’t bend down to stroke
them or to put out their food.
MERCEDES
If they want
to be stroked,
they’ll get up on the furniture.
And Maya can put out their food,
like she did with Manolo.
SALVADOR
No, no. Manolo was the last one.
He says it as if talking about a last love.
They sit on a bench. Mercedes takes a pile of papers
from her purse. Salvador sits on the edge of the bench,
his torso upright.
MERCEDES

I know that it’s almost always no
to everything, but they’re doing a
retrospective of you in Finland
and they’ve invited you to attend.
(Salvador shakes his head.) And
there are exhibitions by Antonio
López, De Chirico and Gordillo.
SALVADOR
Mercedes, you have to

tell them
after my

MERCEDES
But someone has to reply about the
retrospectives, the tributes, the
exhibitions. Your films are still
alive in the world, Salvador. (And
let me remind you that so are
you.)
2. HOTEL MIGUEL ÁNGEL. SWIMMING POOL. INT. DAY.
(The film could start here)
The heated pool is empty. We discover Salvador totally
submerged in the water and completely motionless, his
knees slightly bent and his arms outstretched, as if
supported by invisible armrests. (Underwater shot.)
Weightlessness keeps him in this posture. He just has
to control his breathing. It’s the most similar
sensation to being bodiless.
His head slowly emerges, only as far as his neck, the
rest of his body remains motionless in the same
posture. He keeps his eyes closed, he breathes
steadily.
His head submerges again. In this position his body
doesn’t suffer any muscular tension. Neck, back,
shoulders, knees, the lumbar region, all stiffness
disappears. As he doesn’t feel his body, his mind,
volatile, is like an open window through which the
light and the evening breeze enter. Undoubtedly, the
most pleasant sensation of the day.
3. RIVER. EXT. DAY (EARLY 60S)
The water in the pool transports us to the current in a
river, in the early 60s. Salvador is a child of three

or four who accompanies his mother to wash clothes in
the river of his home village. A very bucolic scene.
Salvador sits astride his mother’s lumbar region (as if
she were a mule) while Jacinta carries on washing
clothes on the wooden washboard. She is accompanied by
Rosita, Marisol and Paqui, all with their respective
washboards in the water. It’s hard work which the women
do cheerfully. When the sequence starts, they are
laughing and little Salvador is overjoyed.
ROSITA
I’d like to be a man so I could
swim naked in the river.
JACINTA
What an idea, Rosita!
Little Salvador rides happily on his mother’s back.
JACINTA
(To Rosita) Before you jump in,
lift him off me, he’s breaking my
back.
Rosita gets up, takes hold of the child and lifts him
off his mother. She puts him at her side, on the river
bank. She gives him a stick so he can play with the
water. It looks as if the child is fishing, but he
likes listening to the women.
4. RIVER. EXT. DAY. (CONT’D)
When she’s on her feet, Rosita asks Marisol to help her
hang out the sheets.
ROSITA
Help me hang out the sheets, Mari.
MARISOL
Sing something for us, Rosita.
Each takes a handle of the basin with Rosita’s clean
clothes and they walk over to some clumps of reeds and
pennyroyal. Rosita starts to sing A tu vera.
ROSITA
A tu vera, a tu vera,
siempre a la verita tuya,
siempre a la verita tuya
aunque yo de pena muera.

Salvador plays with the stick in the water. Jacinta and
Paqui sing the song while they scrub the clothes on the
wooden washboards.
Salvador looks at his mother in profile, with her skin
gleaming with sweat, a straw hat and a headscarf to tie
back her hair and protect her from the sun. Jacinta
smiles back at the child as she sings.
The soap, made at home from fat left over from cooking,
doesn’t produce foam but it leaves (non-contaminating)
lumps on the surface of the water. For the little fish,
the lumps are delicious and they come up to the surface
in little shoals. The child studies that natural
fishbowl, fascinated, and chases after them with his
stick.
MOTHER
Look, the little soap fish are
here.
Don’t you move, Salvita.
Paqui, will you help me with the
basin?
The two women take the basin full of clean clothes and
go over to where Rosita and Marisol are singing. They
all sing.
The child watches them from the river bank. It’s an
image full of life and cheerfulness. This is one of the
few memories that Salvador will have of his mother
cheerful and singing.
At the age of three, Salvador doesn’t realize that this
will be one of the happiest moments in his life.
Everything is perfect, the water in the river, the fish
in his hands, the snow-white sheets spread over reeds
and pennyroyal, his mother smiling, and the women
singing A tu vera.
5. HOTEL MIGUEL ÁNGEL. SWIMMING POOL. INT. DAY. (THE
PRESENT)
An underwater shot travels over Salvador’s body from
the waist up. A large scar divides his back from the
sacrum to the dorsal region. When the camera is
arriving at his shoulders, the present day Salvador’s
head emerges to reality. He remains in the hotel pool
for a few moments.

6. HOTEL MIGUEL ÁNGEL. CAFETERIA. DAY.
Salvador crosses the spacious cafeteria of the Hotel
Miguel Ángel with a medium-sized sports bag. He walks
in a peculiar way, with his torso rigid and his
shoulders slightly slanted forward, but not so much as
to attract attention. Sitting at a table is Zulema
Goldstein, having a coffee and checking her iPhone. She
looks up, pensive, and sees Salvador in the distance.
She hesitates at first, but when he is about to pass
her table she calls to him, delighted.
ZULEMA
Salva!
Salvador is walking along, distracted. He looks at her.
Although he is near the woman, he has trouble
recognizing her.
ZULEMA
I’m Zulema!
Salvador goes up to her and gives her a kiss.
SALVADOR
Zulema!
ZULEMA
What
a
surprise!
This
is
wonderful! Have you time for a
coffee or are you in a hurry?

Zulema is more or less Salvador’s age (60), but she
looks younger. Attractive, she takes very good care of
herself. They almost failed to recognize each other,
but both conceal that. She speaks with a soft
Argentinean accent.
Cut.
7. HOTEL MIGUEL ANGEL. BAR. INT. DAY
Salvador has his cup of coffee on the little table.
Zulema drinks white wine. Their delight at meeting like
this is authentic.
ZULEMA

If you don’t write or film, what
are you going to do?
SALVADOR
(Ironic-bitter) Live, I guess.
ZULEMA
I can’t live without acting. And
it’s getting harder all the time,
but I do almost anything.
SALVADOR
Do you see Alberto? I think he was
in Argentina.
ZULEMA
No. He was in Mexico. He worked on
several soaps but then he came
back here. I met him at a Latino
Film
Festival
on
the
Mayan
Riviera. And he was charming, high
of course, but it was lovely to
meet up with him again. Have you
seen him?
SALVADOR
No, I haven’t seen him since the
premiere of Sabor.
ZULEMA
(Surprised by the question and by
the passing of time) But that was
30 years ago!
SALVADOR
Thirty two. You know, I saw the
film again last week.
ZULEMA
Hadn’t you seen it again?
SALVADOR
Not
since
it
opened,
and
I
shouldn’t say this, but it moved
me.
ZULEMA
I’ve always loved it!
SALVADOR

The Cinematheque has restored the
negative and they’re going to have
several screenings. They’ve asked
me to present it and I thought it
would be a nice idea to do it with
Alberto.
ZULEMA
I’m delighted you don’t bear him a
grudge.
SALVADOR
The
bastard
never
did
the
character that I’d written. At the
time I wanted to kill him, but I
really don’t bear him a grudge.
Zulema nods, she’s very familiar with the story. She
witnessed it, she was living in Madrid at that time.
SALVADOR
Seeing
the
film
now…
his
performance is better than thirty
years ago.
ZULEMA
It’s your eyes that have changed,
darling. The film is the same.
SALVADOR
Do you know how to contact him?
Zulema looks on her cell phone.
ZULEMA
He told me he was living in El
Escorial, in someone’s house. He
only works occasionally, but he
looks well, without giving up youknow-what.
Zulema drinks from her glass of white wine.
ZULEMA
I’m surprised that you’re the one
who
isn’t
working.
I
always
thought you were the kind who
never retired.
SALVADOR
So did I.

Zulema looks on her phone, searching for Alberto’s
number, and she writes it on one of the hotel’s
coasters. She hands it to him.
ZULEMA
Here, I’ve put my number too, in
case you get bored one day and
write something that only I can
do.
There’s a piano in the hotel lobby. The pianist has
just sat down. He starts to play a melody.
8. SCHOOL. LARGE MULTI-USE GYM. INT. DAY. (1966)
We continue to hear the same melody, this time played
by a priest in the school’s large gym. The floor has
various geometrical marks (made with different colored
strips of adhesive tape stuck to the parquet floor) for
practicing different sports. One of the side walls is
covered with gym bars.
The priest and the piano are at the far end.
The door opens and a group of young boys in short pants
come in. Pupils. They are accompanied by a big-bottomed
priest who signals to them to form up in two lines next
to the piano. Once the lines are formed, the bigbottomed priest disappears.
The first priest, at the piano, finishes the song he’s
playing. He shows off happily in front of the boys, but
the boys don’t feel comfortable.
He turns to them, trying to be jovial. The boys look at
him, fearful and rigid.
PRIEST
Good morning, boys. The first
thing we’re going to do is choose
who will be in the choir.
The boys look at each other, not knowing how to take
this.
PRIEST
Has anyone sung in a choir before?
If so, raise your hand.
No one reacts.

PRIEST
Well, we’ll try you out.
He points to the first boy in the line. He has to
insist to get him to come up to the piano. The boy
looks at him nervously, his arms hanging at his sides.
PRIEST
What’s your name?
RODOLFO
Rodolfo.
PRIEST
(Friendly) Well, Rodolfo,
see how you vocalize.

let’s

He plays an arpeggio on the piano and repeats it with
the letter U.
PRIEST
Cu cu cu… Repeat it with me.
The boy tries it, he’s horribly off key.
Cut.
9. SCHOOL. LARGE GYM. INT. DAY (1966)
The priest continues the audition with another boy.
Evaristo. He plays a piece of a melody on the piano
(intervals with Ta ra ra). He makes him repeat it with
increasingly higher notes. This way he can check if he
has a good ear and also his tessitura. The result is
even worse than the previous one, the boys sing off key
with impunity, they are unaware of it.
Cut.
10.

SCHOOL. LARGE GYM. INT. DAY (1966)

Salvador has taken Evaristo’s place next to the piano.
He doesn’t seem nervous.
PRIEST
What’s your name?
SALVADOR CHILD

SALVADOR CHILD
Yes.
PRIEST
Well, at last, someone who likes
singing.
The priest tests his vocalization, ear and tessitura.
Salvador
sings
everything
without
the
slightest
difficulty. The priest is delighted.
SALVADOR OFF
That’s how I became the soloist in
the choir.
11.

SCHOOL. THEATER STAGE. INT. DAY. (1966)

The boys who make up the choir, with Salvador in the
center, form a group of some fifteen or twenty
children. They rehearse on the stage of the school’s
theater. They are accompanied on the stage by the
priest who chose them. He seems happy. He enjoys being
on the stage.
PRIEST
We’ll warm up those voices, boys.
The priest makes extreme sounds, a selection of deep,
screeching, high pitched or piercing sounds, notes
which fall into the abyss or fly upwards, and which the
boys repeat like an echo (the sounds that the priest
proposes to them). The priest orchestrates the long
notes with his arms in a kind of very rich, sonorous
polyphony. During this abstract melody we hear Salvador
off screen.
SALVADOR OFF
The
priests
decided
that
I
wouldn’t
attend
geography
or
history classes, or science or
history of art. For the first
three years of high school, I
spent those periods rehearsing.
And I always passed. They made me
a total ignoramus who passed every
subject without taking the exams.

12.

GEOGRAPHY.

The screen is filled with the word GEOGRAPHY, as the
title of the following chapter. A musical theme
dialogues with Salvador’s off-screen text without
interfering with what he says. The same theme will link
with ANATOMY.
SALVADOR OFF
With
time,
I
became
a
film
director and I started to learn
Spanish geography while traveling
to promote the films I directed.
Both Geography and Anatomy function as two clips, whose
lyrics are Salvador’s monologues. The images are
animated and must be illustrative and didactic, in
their own way. They are seen as independent pieces of
animated drawings, designed by Juan Gatti.
SALVADOR OFF
I
traveled
because
I
was
successful.
My
knowledge
of
geography coincided with my growth
as a filmmaker.
13.

ANATOMY

The caption ANATOMY fills the screen.
(In this case Gatti’s animated drawings show the organs
that he mentions, the ailments he alludes to, including
those of an abstract nature, like panic or depression.)
SALVADOR OFF
I started to get to know my body
through pain and illness. I lived
the
first
thirty
years
with
relative
abandon,
but
I
soon
discovered that my head and what
was inside it, as well as being a
source of pleasure and knowledge,
also carried within it endless
possibilities for pain.
SALVADOR OFF
I soon became acquainted with
insomnia,
chronic
pharyngitis,
otitis,
reflux,
ulcer
and
intrinsic
asthma.
Nerves
in
general
and
the
sciatic
in

particular.
And
all
kinds
of
muscular pains, lumbar, dorsal and
tendinitis, in both knees and
shoulders.
We hear a noise, like a cicada, synthetic-sounding, a
continuous, jarring, very unpleasant note.

I have

that

We
hear
the
so-called
bronchial
and
pulmonary
“whistles”, very fine, smooth sounds, like a ghostly
psychophony, voices of children lost in the darkness
asking for help.
SALVADOR OFF
These are wheezes and whistles. I
also suffer from them. In addition
to the tinnitus and wheezes, my
specialty is headaches, migraines,
tension
headaches
or
cluster
headaches, and back pains. After
the spinal fusion operation (which
immobilized more than half my
back), I discovered that my life
would revolve around my spinal
column. I became aware of each one
of my vertebrae and the number of
muscles and ligaments that make up
the mythology of our organism and
that, as with the Greek gods, our
only way of relating is through
sacrifice. But not everything is
so physical and illustratable. I
also
suffer
from
abstract
hardships, pains in the soul, such
as panic and anxiety, which add
anguish and terror to my life. And
naturally I’ve dealt for years
with depression.
14.
ROAD TO EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STREET. TAXI.
INT./EXT. DAY.
Salvador is inside a taxi. The voiceover continues over
his face.
SALVADOR OFF

On the nights when various pains
coincide… those nights I believe
in God and I pray to him. The days
when I only suffer one kind of
pain, I’m an atheist.
When the voiceover ends the taxi arrives.
15.
EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STREET. EXT. DAY. (THE
PRESENT)
He gets out of the taxi with difficulty. Once outside,
he takes a deep breath of the cold air bathed by a
transparent sun. Coming from Madrid, he appreciates it.
He’s holding the coaster where Zulema wrote down
Alberto’s address and phone number. He puts it back in
his pocket.
Salvador checks the street number and buzzes the entry
phone.
A voice asks who it is.
SALVADOR
Alberto? It’s Salvador.
ALBERTO OFF
Salvador who?
SALVADOR
Salvador Mallo.
Alberto comes down and opens the gate which leads to a
kind of garden and lawn. A modest, pleasant place.
16.

EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. LANDING. INT. DAY.

Alberto wears comfortable clothes, for lounging around
the house. His hair is uncombed, his expression isn’t
very welcoming. Without inviting him in:
ALBERTO
(Puzzled) What are you doing here?
SALVADOR
I have to talk to you.
ALBERTO
About what?
SALVADOR

About Sabor. Will you ask me in?
17.

EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. INT. DAY.

There is a patio with a lawn and some plants. Not much
furniture. It’s a little detached house that must have
known better times. The living area is minimal. You
enter through the kitchen which leads to a living room
which, in turn, leads to a neutral exterior space. The
important thing is that this second exterior patio
leads to a grove of fir trees that brighten up the view
from the windows. In this second exterior area there is
only one old lounger, or two, next to a table, also
made of wood.
The interior is simple. Living room, kitchen and
bedroom. A metal bookcase for books and DVDs, not very
big. Fotogramas Award for Acting. A desk. Few things.
Pleasant.
Three posters decorate the wall. SABOR, in the kitchen,
HAMLET, by Shakespeare, and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, by
Tennessee Williams, on different walls of the living
room. All featuring Alberto Crespo.
Salvador gestures when they come into the kitchen and
he sees Sabor’s poster. It’s a pleasant, opportune
surprise that Alberto has it there.
Alberto looks
expectant.

ALBERTO
Can I get you anything?
SALVADOR
Whatever you’re having.
ALBERTO
I was making some tea.
SALVADOR
That’s fine.
He goes over to the poster and lays his hand on it, as
if caressing it.
SALVADOR
I love that you’ve got Sabor here.
Without looking at him, as he makes the tea, stony:

ALBERTO
Why have you come?
With his right hand still on the poster:
SALVADOR
It’s
taken
me
32
years
to
reconcile myself with this film.
He goes into the sitting room and looks out the windows
at the landscape.
ALBERTO
Will you just tell me why you’ve
come to see me after 32 years?
He gives him a cup of tea, he has another in his hand.
SALVADOR
(Charming) The Cinematheque has
restored Sabor. They’ve decided
it’s
a
classic
and
they’ve
programmed it in a season of films
shot in Madrid. They called me to
ask if we’d present it together.
ALBERTO
Don’t they know we haven’t spoken
since the shoot?
They go over to a couch and a table. Near an ash tray
there is a metal cannula for sniffing any kind of
substance. Salvador looks at the object, but doesn’t
remark on it.
SALVADOR
If they do, they didn’t say
anything to me. Gossip grows old,
like people. Do you mind if we sit
down?
They sit, one at each end of the couch.
SALVADOR
Thank you.
ALBERTO
And why do you want us to present
it together now?

SALVADOR
Because you didn’t present it at
the premiere.
ALBERTO
Because you forbade me!
Salvador speaks with a
little on the defensive.

EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. EXT. DAY.

An hour later. The change in the light indicates the
passing of time.
Salvador and Alberto are in the little garden without
any flowers that gives onto a cluster of fir trees.
Both are lying on loungers.
They are both drinking something, tea, beer or Cocacola.
ALBERTO
Who gave you my address?
SALVADOR
Zulema. I met her by chance and we
talked about you.
Alberto gets ready to chase the dragon. He takes all
the elements from his pocket.
ALBERTO
Listen, I’m going to chase the
dragon. If the sight disgusts you,
you can leave. We’ll talk on the
phone about the Cinematheque.
SALVADOR
Will you invite me?
ALBERTO
I don’t recognize you, Salvador.

TRAIN STATION. HALL. INT. NIGHT. (IN THE 60S)

Salvador-child digs around with one hand inside a
wastepaper basket on the station façade. He finds a
well-thumbed novel, Bonjour, tristesse by Françoise
Sagan.
Jacinta (40, pretty, rural style, curt, her faded dress
doesn’t manage to hide her attractiveness) spreads a
blanket on the floor, surrounded by bundles wrapped in
paper or pieces of cloth. There are also two suitcases
of different sizes and a wicker basket.
JACINTA
Salva, come and help me!
The mother has a blanket in her hand and is about to
make up a bed on the floor with it, next to a wooden
bench. Salvador comes in, euphoric. Nearby is a ticket
booth and a poster for Renfe.
SALVADOR
Mom, I found a novel!
They hear the loud noise of fireworks coming from the
nearby village. While they spread the blanket on the
floor:
JACINTA
(Complaining) How was I to know
that it was a holiday here? It
isn’t a holiday in our village!
21.

TRAIN STATION. WAITING ROOM. NIGHT.

They are sitting on a wooden bench, covered by another
blanket. The mother opens a wicker basket that contains
their food. Salvador puts down his novel and picks up
an album of trading cards of Hollywood stars. The
mother takes out a bar of chocolate.
SALVADOR
Let me open the chocolate.
The mother gives him the chocolate. Salvador takes out
two cards from inside the wrapper.
SALVADOR
There are two cards!

The mother breaks of a quarter of the thick bar of
chocolate and puts it between two pieces of bread. She
gives it to the boy.
MOTHER
Leave the cards for now and eat.
Salvador reads the names on the colored cards.
SALVADOR
Liz Taylor and Robert Taylor. (He
starts to bite the bread and
chocolate.) Are they brother and
sister?
JACINTA
I guess so.
The mother has cut a slice of chorizo and bread with a
sharpened knife.
She looks around, forlorn.
JACINTA
What a disgrace, dumped here like
gypsies!
SALVADOR
I like the station.
JACINTA
You’re a dreamer! I don’t know who
you take after!
Cut.
22.

TRAIN STATION. WAITING ROOM. INT. NIGHT. (CONT’D)

Salvador is lying on the bench and his mother is on the
blanket on the floor. Both lay their heads on bundles
which act as pillows. While Jacinta tucks him in, she
discovers that the child has an enormous hole in one of
his socks.
JACINTA
What a huge hole!
She pulls off his sock.
The mother, sitting under the blanket, opens an old
quince jelly tin or a cookie tin turned into a sewing

box. All imaginable objects live side by side in there.
To Salvador’s eyes, that box is a treasure. Jacinta
takes out a wooden egg. She puts it inside the sock and
starts darning it.
Salvador-child is fascinated by that object, the wooden
egg, and by how his mother is concentrating on her
darning.
From
her
expression
she’s
thinking
of
something else, the future.
SALVADOR
Mom, do you think that Liz Taylor
sews Robert Taylor’s socks?
JACINA
I don’t know. In the card she
doesn’t
look
like
she’s
very
interested in darning.
23.
EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. PATIO. EXT. DAY.
(THE PRESENT)
Salvador opens his eyes, he hears the murmur of the
breeze in the trees. Alberto touches his cheek and
wakes him.
ALBERTO
Are you all right?
Salvador half opens his eyes and murmurs affirmatively.
He closes his eyes again. His pleasant expression shows
that he is still evoking the memory of the journey to
Paterna.
24.

PATERNA. SURROUNDING AREA/CAVES. EXT. DAY

Paterna is a town in Levante. It differs from the rest
of the area because it has over three hundred caves,
most of them inhabited by families. This and other
surrounding areas are home to workers from all parts of
Spain and locals who are badly off.
The family (mother, father, Salvador) walk through an
area of very uneven ground, where pieces of cement
alternate with stretches of earth or plaster. Along the
sides of the path, randomly, there are chimneys
sticking
up
(about
three
or
four
feet
high),
whitewashed, and topped with a little roof. The
chimneys look like primitive sculptures (menhirs) and
they give the esplanade an ancient, Mediterranean air.

On a rope stretched between two poles, two or three
sheets and other clothes flap, moved by a slight
breeze. An occasional mongrel. Two or three children
playing marbles. A woman carrying a basin of water on
her head. Salvador looks at everything, fascinated.
The family trio is transporting all the bundles in a
wheelbarrow pushed by the father. The mother, Jacinta,
is also carrying shapeless bundles in both hands. Even
little Salvador is carrying something.
Jacinta and Venancio (the father) talk. She complains.
JACINTA
What a long night! I thought we’d
never get here. The whole night in
the station!
FATHER
I told you to wait a few days,
until I got more settled in.
JACINTA
Your mother was fed up with us.
FATHER
Don’t say that…
JACINTA
Three days ago I heard her say
“This month my bread bill has gone
up so much!”
The father frowns, annoyed.
FATHER
Don’t pay any heed to that.
JACINTA
I won’t be a burden to anyone!
That same day I packed our bags
and here we are. Or would you
rather be alone?
FATHER
Don’t say that, but you could have
waited a few days.
Near the chimneys there are also some rectangular
shaped openings in the ground, on four little walls

between 20 and 30 inches high. The family stops next to
one of these openings to rest.
The mother sees in the distance a group of one or two
storied buildings, beyond an imposing Arab tower.
MOTHER
Is it much farther?
FATHER
No, we’re here.
The mother points to the closest buildings.
MOTHER
Is that where our house is?
FATHER
No. We’re on top of it.
The mother doesn’t understand. The father points to the
open surface, 20 inches above the ground and protected
by a grille that lets in light and air and keeps out
birds, insects and animals. (It’s like the parapet of a
well, but rectangular instead of circular). The mother
looks over the edge, not understanding what her husband
is trying to tell her. At the bottom there is a
flowerpot with a geranium and an assortment of tiles
arranged haphazardly.
MOTHER
A cave!
FATHER
I couldn’t find anything better.
MOTHER
For God’s sake, Venancio, a cave!
FATHER
There are three hundred families
living in caves here, it’s typical
of this village. There’s no shame
in it.
Salvador sees in the distance a boy of eighteen
whitewashing a wall. The boy catches his attention. The
father, a humble, inscrutable man, feels humiliated by
the mother’s reaction and he takes it out on the boy.
FATHER

Salvador, come here!
25.

PATERNA. SALVADOR’S FAMILY’S CAVE. EXT. DAY.

They go through the opening of an underground tunnel
that leads to the door of the cave house. Jacinta looks
at everything, greatly annoyed. She is a proud woman
and it’s hard for her to accept that they’ve left their
home village in search of fortune only to end up living
in a cave.
FATHER
I swept it as best I could. And
we’ve got light.
26.

PATERNA. SALVADOR’S FAMILY’S CAVE. INT. DAY.

The mother looks around at the interior. It’s like a
grotto with low, irregular ceilings. They put down
their bundles where they can.
FATHER
It was your idea to
village and come here.

the

MOTHER
(Somber) What would they say in
the village if they could see us!
FATHER
I didn’t have time to whitewash
it, that’s why I wanted you to
wait a while.
There are two amorphous spaces that we’ll call rooms,
in one of them there is a Singer sewing machine. And a
wooden box that acts as a table. On top of the box is a
bottle of wine. Jacinta looks annoyed when she sees the
bottle but she says nothing. There is also a humble
bed, covered by a humble bedspread. However, to
Salvador’s eyes the cave is a fantastic place. The two
rooms are whitewashed. In the area bathed by light from
the skylight, the large flaking surfaces are much more
noticeable, but they don’t detract from the beauty of
the place. For the boy’s sensitivity, those flaking
surfaces are like works of abstract art, although he
doesn’t know what that is. He just knows that he likes
it. He enters the area of light as if it were a sacred
place. He hears his mother’s complaints and his
father’s explanations, but they don’t affect him. What

matters to him is the light, and living in a cave is
like living inside a comic strip.
FATHER
I cleaned it as best I could.
The floor is a mixture of cement and tiles typical of
the region, reminiscent of Gaudí, and trims of lime.
The boy looks up and sees the very blue sky around a
white cloud. He tries to share this discovery with his
mother.
SALVADOR
Mom, look! The sky!
Jacinta walks forward with the feeling that she’s going
to hit her head on the ceiling. This part is flaking
much more than that at the entrance. The walls have an
irregular shape, like a grotto, there are no straight
lines. There are parts painted white, but mostly the
paint has flaked off, revealing rock or brown earth. In
one corner there is a brush and dust pan. Near the area
that gets most light from the roof, there are two stone
benches which suggest that there used to be a kitchen
there. The father has bought a hot plate and some
trivets.
Jacinta and Salvador are bathed by the light from the
skylight. It doesn’t seem like sunlight, it’s kindlier,
softer. The father looks at them from the shadows,
ashamed. Jacinta leaves the boy and goes back to her
husband. She tries to cheer him up. They go to what
will be their room. Finally, tenderly:
JACINTA
Are you happy we’re here?
FATHER
Jacinta, I wanted something else
for you. Do you think I’m happy
bringing you to a cave? But
there’s nothing else.
JACINTA
I’ll fix it up and this will look
like a home. But your mother,
really, saying that to us about
the bread, in front of the child!

She looks round to where the boy is, from force of
habit, and shouts.
JACINTA
Salvador! (To the father) He loves
it.
She looks at Venancio with warm, knowing eyes. And she
gives him a kiss.
27.
EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. INT. DUSK. (THE

Salvador calls a taxi company on his phone. He gives
his address in Madrid and that of Alberto in El
Escorial. Alberto is beside him and hears the details.

Salvador accedes, he barely brushes the other’s cheek.
And he gets into the car with difficulty while Alberto
watches.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

On the way back, night has fallen. Salvador comes into
his house. On a sideboard near the door he finds a note
from Maya, his maid. “Miss Mercedes rang. Call her as
soon as you can.”
30.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

Salvador takes his phone from his pocket and calls
Mercedes’ number.
MERCEDES OFF

SALVADOR
It’s me.
Mercedes is at her desk in front of the computer. On
the wall a poster of Fellini’s 8½.
MERCEDES

SALVADOR
Yes.
MERCEDES

MERCEDES
I’m delighted that they’re showing

SALVADOR
It isn’t that I want a Q&A, but
I’m curious to see if the film has
survived these 30 years.
MERCEDES
You’d better believe it. But if
you decide not to go, tell me and

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. DAY (THE NEXT DAY)

Salvador is lying on the bed reading. He is dressed for
lounging at home, warm, comfortable, good quality
clothes. The bedroom door is half open.

He’s reading Nothing Grows by Moonlight, by Torborg
Nedreaas. We hear a paragraph in voiceover.
Salvador underlines the paragraph with a pencil.
SALVADOR OFF
“I entered the room where Johannes
was. He had rolled over into a
ball, so there was no room for me.
When I tried to make a space for
myself, he woke and we made love,
but loneliness stayed with me and
I couldn’t chase it out of my
heart. We were as close as two
people can be, but we were in
separate worlds”.
32.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. DAY (AFTERNOON, ANOTHER
DAY)
Salvador is lying on the green velvet couch facing the
terrace. There isn’t much light (a faint lamp that
bounces off a wall). He lays his hand over his
forehead, the contact with himself eases his headache a
little. He hears the doorbell. He waits until it rings
two or three times. Then he gets up. In these
circumstances it is obvious that he has trouble getting
to his feet. He puts his hands on his lumbar region. He
is very rigid as he takes the first steps. Then he
walks normally.
He is dressed differently so that it doesn’t seem like
the same day as the previous sequence.
33.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. DAY. (CONT’D)

Every time Salvador gets up it has to be seen that he
forces himself to walk normally. Generally this is
accompanied by a gasp of pain, if he’s alone, and by
him raising a hand to his dorsal and lumbar region.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. DAY. (CONT’D)

The house is in semi-darkness. Probably there is no
light switched on, if dusk is falling. In any case,
there is sufficient light coming through the glass
doors that connect the living room with the terrace.

SALVADOR
Do you want a drink?
ALBERTO
Any liquor.
We stay with Alberto looking at the paintings. He
starts to hear some dreadful coughing coming from the
kitchen.
Salvador is gasping for air, his face is red, his
coughs are becoming deeper. Alberto comes into the
kitchen and goes to help him. Something must have gone
down the wrong way.
ALBERTO
Breathe through your nose.
Salvador gradually starts to breathe normally again.
His face is red, his eyes are watering, it was a very
bad choking spell.
Salvador had already taken out the bottle and glasses
and left them on the center table.
SALVADOR
Fuck, I choke on nothing!
Alberto gives him a glass of water.
ALBERTO
Here, drink it slowly. You scared
me! I thought you were going to
choke to death.
SALVADOR

to time. And it’s horrible.
He finishes slowly drinking the water.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT. NIGHT. (IN
FRONT OF THE TELEVISION)
A large couch with lots of cushions of different sizes
and colors. An exquisitely designed square table full
of DVDs and Blurays, a large plasma screen between the
two bookcases that fill the wall facing the couch.
Lamps at both ends of the couch, one of colored
crystals, Memphis style, the other by Lloyd Wright.
Above the couch, a large painting of tree trunks, by
Abraham Lacalle that is reminiscent of David Hockney,
and The Flower, by Jorge Galindo, if it fits.
The place overflows with DVDs, Blurays and books.
Alberto is getting ready to chase the dragon. Salvador
watches him. The TV is showing La niña santa by
Lucrecia Martel. Alberto offers him the pipe. Salvador
takes a puff and he feels as if he’s floating.
36.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT. NIGHT.

Salvador isn’t in any shape for talking a lot, he’s out
of it.
Alberto looks at him, he decides not to leave him on
his own in that state. Salvador is still new to this.
Alberto moves unhurriedly towards the desk, at one end
of the room, next to a window that is cinemascopeshaped, a rectangle twice as long as it is high and
which looks out on the street. From the window, the
tree trunks can be seen.
Alberto pokes around on the top of the desk.
37.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. DESK. BOOKSHELF. WINDOW. INT.
NIGHT.
He looks at the objects and papers that surround the
computer. He looks over to make sure that Salvador is
still out of it. He sits down in front of the computer
screen. On the desk there are several notebooks laid
out tidily, stacks of paper, a magnifying glass, a
blood pressure monitor, boxes of medicines, a file with
cuttings… a great variety of objects, all neatly
arranged.

Just to try, Alberto clicks on the mouse and discovers
that the computer is connected and the desktop screen
offers him lots of documents. He reads the titles in
passing: Detour, Parallel Mothers, Too Many Gender
Changes, Strange Life Form, Mermaids and Replicants.
Attractive titles. But the one that most catches his
attention is called Addiction. Of course. Alberto
supposes that Salvador is writing something about his
initiation into heroin, which explains his present
curiosity. He doesn’t hesitate for a second before
diving into the document. And rummaging in it.

He looks at Salvador who is still drowsy.

SALA MIRADOR (THEATER). STAGE. INT. NIGHT.

Alberto imagines himself on a bare stage, with just a
large screen to one side. In this part of the
monologue, the real wall of the stage is painted black,
like the whole theater. Some pipes stick out, and a
square box with a red fire hose, all protected by a
glass screen.
ALBERTO
The films were projected on
enormous, whitewashed wall.

an

(In his imagination, Alberto goes up to the white
screen that represents the white wall in the form of a
rectangle.)
ALBERTO
I particularly remember the films
in
which
there
was
water:
waterfalls, beaches, the bottom of
the sea, rivers or springs.
The screen is filled with different landscapes with
moving water. It ends with a scene by a river, intense
colors shot “day for night” in Splendor in the Grass,
the film by Elia Kazan. Alberto points to one end and
the other of the whitewashed rectangle, that is, to the
left and right of the base of the screen.

ALBERTO
Just hearing the sound of running
water

the
kids
a
tremendous desire to urinate and
we’d do it right there, on both
sides of the screen. In the cinema
of my childhood it always smells
of piss and jasmine, and of the
summer breeze.
(In the scene by the river Nathalie Wood runs along the
riverbank in a red dress and high heels. Marilyn Monroe
also appears for a moment, singing Kiss in Niagara.)

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

Insert occasional close-ups of a groggy Salvador on the
couch, which will help do ellipses in the reading. It
gives the impression that what Alberto is reading (and
which he imagines performing) is being dreamed by
Salvador.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

Alberto finishes reading Salvador’s text. He turns his
head and looks over at the couch where the author is
vegetating. He has just opened his eyes. He starts to
waken slowly and heavily, distant, expressionless.
Without a headache. For a few moments neither says
anything.

Alberto picks a little at the food.

Salvador opens the refrigerator and drinks a liquid
yogurt.
ALBERTO

enthusiastic)
Listen,

Salvador isn’t interested in the subject.
SALVADOR
It isn’t a story.
ALBERTO
Well, whatever it is, it could be
staged just as it is.
Salvador rejects the idea. He speaks with the distance
that heroin gives. This isn’t the case with Alberto,
he’s more used to it.
SALVADOR
Thank you, but it isn’t a dramatic
text.

He takes the paper from his pocket.

CINEMATHEQUE. SCREENING ROOM. INT. NIGHT.

Applause. The end credits appear on the cinema screen.
We hear the final theme music. The audience continues
applauding. The screening room is full, a very varied
audience. Many young spectators who hadn’t even been
born when the film was made. Mercedes is among them,
excited and moved by the screening and by the
audience’s reaction. She looks at her watch uneasily.
With the lights still out, in the area nearest the
stage, the director of the Cinematheque is murmuring
with two employees who are asking him something. This
must be seen from Mercedes’ point of view: the director
tells them to put three chairs in front of the seats on
the main floor, on a little dais on which there is only
the microphone on a stand with which he presented the
film.
Mercedes, curious, watches them from her seat. The
director, looking worried, walks along the central
aisle to the door of the screening room, separated by
red curtains. The stage curtains are a bluish grey. The
director looks nervous, he has his cell phone in his
hand, like a appendix of himself. He stops by the red
curtains.
Mercedes goes up to him, they obviously know each
other. As they talk, they walk to the other door, which
leads to a large café with tables, a bar and lots of
film posters on the walls (classics of Spanish and
foreign cinema, among the former we see the posters for
Arrebato, El sur, Peppermint Frappé, Casa Flora,
Furtivos, Viridiana, El espíritu de la colmena, Bilbao,
Magical Girl, Tras el cristal, La Dama de Beirut,
Plácido, Atraco a las tres, Tesis, Muerte de un
ciclista, Tristana, El extraño viaje, Bienvenido Mr.
Marshall, El pico or Duerme, duerme, mi amor).

advertising the season that includes Salvador’s film:
Madrid and the cinema.

From where they are we can see the entrance from the

Yes, yes. The director is on his

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.

Salvador and Alberto, in front of the bathroom mirror.
Salvador’s phone rings on the vanity top. The name of
the director of the Cinematheque appears on the screen.
No one answers the phone. Alberto looks at it, furious.
Both Alberto and Salvador are pale and drugged. Alberto

CINEMATHEQUE. SCREENING ROOM. INT. NIGHT

The director is at the front of the screening room
talking to a friend about the situation. He’s stressed
out. The spectators murmur but very few have left. Some
have taken the opportunity to go to the washroom or to
bring drinks from the bar. The atmosphere is relaxed.
We get the impression that all those people have
nothing better to do than wait there, sitting, leaning
on the backs of the seats or standing chatting. Many of
them are busy on their phones. Mercedes has gone back
to her seat, uneasy. The director of the Cinematheque
has an exaggerated quiff, Jon Kortajerena style. Like a
tic, he touches the quiff from time to time. His phone
rings, it’s Salvador.
DIRECTOR
Salvador? Where are you?
He moves to the center, under the stage, where the
chairs are and the mike with which he presented the
film.

DIRECTOR

the
spectators)
And
the
leading actor, Alberto Crespo. Do
you mind applauding again so they
can hear it? It might encourage
them.
Salvador and Alberto, perplexed, hear the applause over
the phone’s loudspeaker. Salvador is amused by the
situation and it seems that so is the audience.
SALVADOR
(Surprised) Is everyone listening
to me?
DIRECTOR
Yes.
SALVADOR
I
want
to
apologize
to
the
spectators. At the last minute I
didn’t feel well. I’m with Alberto
Crespo, we were intending to go.
He stayed to keep me company.
In the screening room one spectator raises his hand.
DIRECTOR
Just a minute, someone has raised
his hand, he wants to ask a
question.
A Cinematheque employee hands the spectator a mike.
While they listen to the question, Alberto quickly puts
two lines of cocaine on the table. With his lips he
spells out to Salvador “c o c a i n e “ and he offers
him the little snorter. Before the spectator finishes
the question, Salvador quickly snorts one of the lines
which immediately stimulates him.

SPECTATOR
This is a question for the film’s
director. What do you think of
Alberto Crespo’s performance in
the film? There are people who say
you weren’t happy with it and
that’s why you grew apart.
Alberto and Salvador exchange glances.
DIRECTOR

SALVADOR
Yes.
Alberto looks at him and expects him to go off on a
tangent. The spectator insists.
SPECTATOR
I read that after Sabor you argued
and didn’t see each other again.
SALVADOR
Look, time is mysterious. I saw
the film again a month ago, and I
think that Alberto’s performance
has gained a lot since we released
it.
Alberto looks at him, disconcerted.
SECOND SPECTATOR
What was it that you didn’t like
back then?
Salvador moves away from Alberto, who is now listening
closely, with an amazed expression.
SALVADOR
Its heaviness, its lethal rhythm.
I’d conceived a dynamic, daring
character,
a
funny,
scathing
cocaine addict.
Alberto glares at him.
Laughter among the audience. The director of the
Cinematheque is happy, he is finally having a kind of
Q&A with Salvador Mallo. Mercedes is listening, very

serious. Apart from Alberto, she is the only person who
isn’t amused by the situation. Salvador moves a little
away from Alberto and only speaks into the phone.
SALVADOR
Alberto didn’t have the lightness
that I asked for, not because he
was incapable, but because he was
taking the opposite drug to the
character, he was taking heroin
The rhythm of his performance was
graver, and the humor in the text
disappeared. But I have to be
fair, now I think that that
gravity
goes
well
with
the
character, it gives him substance.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT (CONT’D)

Alberto slaps him on the arm, or pushes him, and
Salvador falls into an armchair or stumbles against the
wall. He raises a hand to his back in a gesture of
pain. The phone falls to the floor. Alberto kicks it,
it slides along until it knocks against a wall or a
piece of furniture.
ALBERTO
(Furious) How dare you!
He grabs him by his shirt front and is about to punch
him.
Salvador takes a deep breath. Serious.
SALVADOR
I didn’t mean to say it but now
it’s said.
ALBERTO
Be careful with me, eh? I won’t
let you humiliate me again! Who do
you think you are?
He goes to the door.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. BEDROOM. INT. NIGHT.

Salvador leaves six tablets of different colors and
sizes on top of the chest of drawers. When he takes one
out of the blister pack (tryptizol, for example) it
rolls along the top and falls to the floor. There are
no more in the blister.
Alberto takes a pillow from the bed and throws it on
the floor. He kneels down on the pillow and picks up
the tablet.
He crushes the tablets with a metal lighter. When he
has reduced them to powder he pours this into a glass
of water. And he drinks it. He goes to bed, he does
breathing exercises.

Mercedes and Maya, in the kitchen. Maya, standing, is

VALLECAS. EXT. DAY.

Salvador gets out of a taxi in an area of Vallecas
occupied by drug dealers. He arrives at an almost
deserted corner. Several young Nigerians talk and
laugh. On a wall, an enormous graffiti says “I do
believe in you, sister”.
On the sidewalk, Salvador is the only white man, and an
obvious target. A Nigerian capturer comes up to him. He
speaks Spanish with an almost incomprehensible accent.
CAPTURER
Can I help you with anything?
SALVADOR
I don’t know.

CAPTURER
What do you want?
SALVADOR
A dose.
CAPTURER
Ten euros.
Salvador doesn’t fully understand him.
SALVADOR
Ten euros?
The capturer nods.
SALVADOR
Don’t bring me shit. If it’s good,
I’ll come back.
CAPTURER
Give me the money.
No,

SALVADOR.

CAPTURER
In cash and now. Wait here.
Salvador gives him the money and the capturer
disappears. Salvador looks at the people swarming
around him, a mixture of residents and clients who walk
quickly.
He hears shouting, he looks over to where it’s coming
from, in the same street.
54.

THE SAME STREET. EXT. DAY

Two drug apartment “vigilantes” confront each other,
one with a knife and the other with a machete. The man
with the machete is heavily built. He has the sheath
for the weapon (with a sword hilt) in his left hand.
The man with the knife has a jacket rolled around his
left arm as a shield. The two threaten each other
verbally but we can’t understand what they’re saying.
One shouts “NO” all the time.
The man with the machete forces his opponent to back
away. Both rip the air with blows that are easily

avoided. A friend tries to separate them but finally
gives up. The man with the machete cuts the other on
the leg. It mustn’t be very deep because he stays on
his feet and keeps attacking the heavily built man.
Among those watching the duel there is a group of four,
with haircuts and clothes similar to that of the
duelists. They end up getting between the two. And
rather than convincing them, it seems that the duelists
have got bored with the fight. The one with the machete
puts the weapon in its sheath and goes off in the
opposite direction to the other, wounded in the leg,
but still on his feet and leaving a trail of blood on
the ground.
A police car drives up.
Salvador has seen everything from a prudent distance. A
neighbor films the duel from his balcony. Salvador is
leaving when the capturer appears. He calls him.
Salvador takes the merchandise. The transaction takes
only an instant.
55.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON-EVENING

Salvador is lying on different colored cushions. He
eyes are half open. He ends up closing them and
welcoming his childhood in Paterna.
56.

PATERNA. OUTSKIRTS/CAVES. EXT. DAY. 1966

Salvador-child is sitting on the stairs of the Arab
Tower which dominates the area of caves where he lives
with his family. He’s reading Bonjour, tristesse, the
book he found in the wastepaper basket in the station,
or an encyclopedia.
Eduardo and Conchita, a young couple, pass near the
tower and are struck by the sight of a child reading a
book. Eduardo is a builder and house painter and is
dressed as such. Salvador saw him the first day, from a
distance. The couple are young, attractive and very
rural looking.
EDUARDO
He’s so young and look at how he’s
reading!
Salvador looks up from the book and smiles at the
couple. When they’ve walked past, the girl turns to
him.

CONCHITA
Hey, can you write too?
SALVADOR CHILD
Of course…
CONCHITA
How much would you charge us for
writing a letter to my aunt in
Bilbao?
SALVADOR CHILD
I don’t know.
57.
PATERNA. ENTRANCE TO FAMILY CAVE. TOWER. EXT.
DAY.
The mother comes out to empty a bucket of dirty water.
Or she comes with a pitcher of water from the fountain
on her hip. She goes over to the group.
MOTHER
What’s going on?
CONCHITA
We wanted your son to write a
letter
for
us,
because
my
boyfriend is illiterate.
Eduardo thinks that remark is unnecessary. He protests:
EDUARDO
When can I learn, if I’m working
all day!
CONCHITA
(Arguing) If you didn’t waste your
time drawing…
Eduardo looks at his girlfriend, obviously angry.
They’re about to start arguing seriously, but they
control themselves.
The mother is immediately interested in the builder. So
is Salvador.
MOTHER
You’re a builder.
EDUARDO

And a painter.
MOTHER
Of
course!
What
a
pity,
so
handsome, and you’re illiterate.
My Salvador could teach you to
read and write, at night, when you
finish working.
She looks at the child who seems to agree.
MOTHER
Whenever it suits you.
EDUARDO
(He nods.) Could you
maths too?

teach

me

Before his mother can answer, Salvador does it himself.
SALVADOR CHILD
Yes.
MOTHER
Of course, maths, so no one can
cheat you. My Salvador can teach
you everything. In the world we
live in, being illiterate is a
handicap. I’ll get paper and a
pencil so he can write the letter.
CONCHITA
(Very interested) How much would
you charge us?
MOTHER
Nothing! (To Eduardo) You’re a
builder, you could lend me a hand
with
the
kitchen,
and
finish
painting the walls, when it suits
you.
EDUARDO
It would have to be at weekends.
MOTHER
At weekends then, and in exchange
my Salvador will teach you to read
and write and maths! And today’s
letter is free.

The girlfriend thinks it’s a good deal.
Cut.
58.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. NIGHT.

Eduardo whitewashes a peeling section of the ceiling
and wall, in what would be the dwelling’s hallway. He
does it with a brush, a pole and a piece of lambskin on
the tip. Salvador, sitting on a little chair, looks at
Eduardo, concentrating on the lesson.
Eduardo says the ABC out loud. Jacinta is with them,
she is preparing the dinner and washing dishes in a
basin.
EDUARDO
A B C CH D E F…
JACINTA
Eduardo, when are you going to put
in the sink? I have to wash
everything in these basins.
She points to some basins full of water.
EDUARDO
I wanted to do the walls first.
JACINTA
I’ve got used to them peeling, the
sink is more urgent.
EDUARDO
Salvador
gives
me
a
lot
of
homework. I don’t have time.
Jacinta looks at her son as if he were a stranger. Who
can he have taken after? Even she is surprised that he
behaves like a real teacher.
SALVADOR CHILD
If he wants to learn to read and
write, he has to learn the ABC.
Come on, Eduardo, start again.
EDUARDO
A B C CH D E F G J K…
Salvador corrects him.
SALVADOR CHILD

No, Eduardo. F G “H I” J K. You
said it right before.
EDUARDO
There’s a lot of letters.
SALVADOR CHILD
Stop complaining. There is

JACINTA
(To herself) What a scold!
Cut.
59.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. NIGHT.

By the light of a bare bulb, at a round table, near the
area lit by the skylight (even at night), Salvador
continues his lessons. The two boys are dressed
slightly differently to give the sensation that time
has passed. The mother is making a lampshade. She looks
over at the boys from time to time. More of the cave is
painted than in the previous sequence, but precisely
the wall behind the boys is crumbling, and the flaking
paint looks like a map.
On the round table, as well as an encyclopedia there is
a child’s exercise book with letters at the start of
each page. Eduardo holds the pencil clumsily and copies
the letter A.
SALVADOR CHILD
Give me the pencil. You don’t hold
it like that. Hold it like this.
Salvador gives him back the pencil and helps him place
it correctly between his thumb, his middle finger and
his index finger. The builder bends over the exercise
book. He holds the pencil the wrong way.
SALVADOR CHILD
Look at how I hold it.
Eduardo imitates him.
SALVADOR CHILD
That’s it.
On the page there are only vowels. Eduardo has to copy
the line of vowels at the top of the page.

SALVADOR CHILD
You don’t have to hold it so
tightly. Let your hand go loose,
I’ll move it for you.
Salvador lays his hand on the bricklayer’s, much bigger
than his. He grips it and helps him write the vowels.
The
bricklayer’s
hand
trembles,
intimidated
by
Salvador’s skill and his own clumsiness.
EDUARDO
I’m a bit nervous.
That’s
drawing?

SALVADOR CHILD

Do
you

like

EDUARDO
A lot.
SALVADOR CHILD
Then you’ll learn to write very
soon. It’s like drawing, except
with letters. Now you do it on
your own.
The mother looks at them, pensive, from the improvised
kitchen.
Cut.
60.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. NIGHT.

The mother is at the sewing machine. The peeling wall
that looks like a map is half painted, or totally
painted. The exercise book on the table has sentences
written at the top. Hanging on the wall is a photo of
Jacinta and Venancio under a string of recently made
chorizos and blood sausages.
SALVADOR CHILD
Read the sentence.
EDUARDO

Who’s that?

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. DINING ROOM. INT. DAY. (THE
PRESENT)
A close-up of the white table in the dining room.
Various envelopes and invitations to exhibitions,
premieres and various events come into frame. Mercedes
has just put the papers on the table.
Salvador is sitting, he glances at them. From the
kitchen, where she is heating water which she then
pours into two cups to make tea:
MERCEDES
There’s a load of invitations. It
wouldn’t be a bad idea for you to
go somewhere. I’ll go with you
wherever you want. And the dance
season
has
started.
Dimitris
Papaioannou and Jan Fabre are
coming to the Canal Theaters.
SALVADOR
I’d like to go. But theater seats
are the most uncomfortable for me
and I don’t want to leave in the
middle.
Mercedes looks at him, really concerned. She knows that
Salvador has made an effort to see her, that he didn’t
really feel like it.
MERCEDES
Have you gone to see Dr. Galindo?
SALVADOR
No, I’m fed up with doctors.
She joins him at the white table in the dining room.
MERCEDES
And how do you get the oxycodone?
SALVADOR
(Lying) A friend gets it for me,
his mother is a chemist…

Mercedes doesn’t insist. Until that moment she has
taken care of everything. But she still feels a great
respect for him. For her, he is still her boss, even
though neither of them works. Salvador doesn’t usually
lie, but it’s obvious that he’s going through a process
in which she has no part.
MERCEDES
The Guggenheim has asked us for
two
of
the
Pérez
Villaltas.
They’re doing a retrospective of
his work.
SALVADOR
Tell them no. Those paintings are
my only company.
Mercedes’ phone rings. She looks at the caller ID and
tuts in annoyance.
MERCEDES
Sorry.
She gets up and walks to the window. Salvador takes the
opportunity to go to the bathroom in his bedroom.
62.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. BATHROOM/SALVADOR’S BEDROOM.
INT. DAY.
He takes a puff on a heroin cigarette that he has
already prepared. He opens the bedroom window to air
the room. Then after one puff he stubs it out.
63.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT. DAY.

He goes back to the living room.
The sunlight reflects on the waxed wooden floor, and
rebounds, transformed into a powerful ray, on a level
with Salvador’s head as he sits at the table. He puts
on dark glasses and looks at some of the invitations.
The figure of Mercedes is silhouetted against one of
the large windows that lead out to a terrace.
MERCEDES
I have to hang up. I can’t keep
talking…
It’s
none
of
your
business where I am…

She puts the phone away and comes back to the table,
next to Salvador. He is much more relaxed, she is more
nervous.
The phone conversation has changed Mercedes’ mood. Even
Salvador, half stoned, realizes.
SALVADOR
Is anything wrong?
MERCEDES
Luis and I are separating.
I didn’t

SALVADOR

MERCEDES
I didn’t want to bother you. It’s
been going on for a while, and now
that I’m at home so much I can’t
keep fooling myself.
SALVADOR
I’m sorry.
MERCEDES
I think I’m a better assistant
than I am a wife so, if you don’t
mind, I’d like to carry on taking
care of your mail. People like to
get an answer.
SALVADOR
But it’s always no.
MERCEDES
Well, you should do something. You
have too much free time to think
about your ailments. Give your
brain
something
to
keep
it
occupied.
SALVADOR
I’d like to do more things too,
Mercedes.
MERCEDES
You could write. You have lots of
documents full of ideas to be

developed. If you want, I’ll make
you a list.
SALVADOR
I
don’t
want
to
write
if
afterwards I can’t film it. And
you know better than anyone that I
can’t film in these conditions.
Without
filming

meaningless, but that’s how things
are.
64.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. DOOR. INT. DAY.

They say goodbye at the door.
He automatically takes off his glasses to give her two
kisses on her cheeks. Mercedes sees his eyes. She
imagines what has caused the change. Her heart sinks,
but she covers up.
MERCEDES
(Serious) Call me, for anything.
65.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

Salvador reads in bed, lit by a reading lamp on the
bedside table which is piled with books.
66.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY.

Jacinta, the town’s pious woman and Salvador-child are
sitting in the sunlit patio, surrounded by plants. The
cave is spotless despite the scarcity of furniture.
Three chairs and a round table.
The pious woman drinks some fresh orange juice. Jacinta
offers her some madeleines from her village. She and
the boy are also drinking juice.
PIOUS WOMAN
Jacinta,

at the skylight, her face, flooded
by the light, is softened.) And
this light is priceless.
JACINTA
It rains at times.
PIOUS WOMAN

Jacinta, don’t be so selfish. We
need the rain. Think of the
countryside, the farmers.

Yes, that’s true.

Salvador looks at her, thinking she’s mad.
JACINTA
He’s always been ahead of boys his
age.
Salvador is intrigued and bored by the conversation.
PIOUS WOMAN
Do you like teaching, Salvador?
SALVADOR
Yes.
PIOUS WOMAN
And would you like to study?
SALVADOR
Yes, a lot.
PIOUS WOMAN
Why?
SALVADOR
To know more and be able to teach
more things.
PIOUS WOMAN
Very good. That’s what I call a

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY. (CONT’D)

Jacinta comes back trying to show a delight that isn’t
real and ease Salvador’s hostility.
JACINTA
(Sweetly) Salvador, I’m going to
make a potato omelet, the way you
like it.
As if he hasn’t heard her, surly:
SALVADOR
Is a seminary a place to become a
priest?
The mother takes out some potatoes and starts peeling
them.
MOTHER
Yes.
SALVADOR
(He protests) But I don’t want to
be a priest!
MOTHER
You don’t have to be one.
SALVADOR
Then why do you want me to go to a
seminary?!
MOTHER
Because that’s the only way poor
people can study!
Salvador gets up from the chair and disappears along
the hallway. Jacinta calls him but the child doesn’t
answer. She stops peeling potatoes and leaves the
house, furious.
68.

PATERNA. TOWER. EXT. DAY.

Once outside she looks around for Salvador among the
chimneys. She sees him going up the steps of the Arab
tower. She goes over there, very Italian. She arrives
breathless at the foot of the tower. Salvador has

arrived at the top of the steps. He leans against the
wall, his arms folded, in a rebellious attitude.
The mother shouts at him from below:
MOTHER

From down below, the mother continues shouting,
attracting the attention of two women who pass with
basins of water on their heads.
MOTHER
When you get your diploma, you can
leave. We’ll find a way for you to
study for a career, so you don’t
end up like your father.
SALVADOR
I don’t want to go to school! I
want to stay here!
MOTHER
(Indignant) And what will you do
here? Kill yourself working in the
fields or on a building site, eh?!
Is that what you want?
SALVADOR
I don’t want to be a priest!
69.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. OFFICE. INT. DAY.

Salvador reading from a lectern on his desk, The Book
of Disquiet, by Pessoa.
SALVADOR OFF
“I find life distasteful, like a
useless medicine, and that’s when

(CONT’D)
Alberto appears at the far end of the path leading to
the gate. He sees Salvador on the other side of the
bars, with a leather briefcase in his hand.
ALBERTO
If you don’t go away, I’ll call
the police!
SALVADOR
Alberto, I’ve come to negotiate.
I’ll give you the rights to
perform Addiction.
ALBERTO
I don’t believe you! Go away! I’m
busy!
SALVADOR
It’s the truth. I’ve brought you a
copy of the text. Let me in,
please.
Alberto comes up to the gate and unlocks it with a
rusty key and a very unfriendly expression.
ALBERTO

If this is a trick, you’re going
to leave here in worse shape than
you’re in now!
As they walk to the kitchen, Alberto looks at him and
sees that Salvador has deteriorated.
ALBERTO
What’s going on? Are you on hunger
strike?
SALVADOR
(Ironic) The bad life.
72.

EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. INT. DAY.

They come into the kitchen. On the table, there are
several sketches on sheets of paper and the text by
Cocteau. There are two chairs, one on each side of the
table. Salvador sits down, breathing heavily. He puts
his briefcase on the table and looks at the sketches.
They all show a man, a bed and another man, who is
usually on the bed reading a newspaper. Le bel

sketches. Alberto sits across from Salvador.

ALBERTO
Yes, but I’ve got lots of doubts.
The text is beautiful but it’s
outdated now. If you really give
me Addiction, I’ll go full out on
it. I’d have to inform the people
at the Mirador, of course.
Salvador opens his briefcase and takes out a block of
pages stapled together: the text of Addiction. He hands
it to Alberto.
SALVADOR
Here it is.
He leaves it on the table. Alberto picks it up, he
can’t believe it.
ALBERTO
Why the change of heart?

SALVADOR
(He doesn’t answer the question.)
I’ve made a few changes to the
text, bearing in mind that it’s
going to be spoken on a stage, and
I’ll tell you more if you invite
me to a coffee.
Alberto still can’t believe it. He starts preparing a
Nespresso coffee.
ALBERTO
Anything else?
SALVADOR
I don’t want to sign it. And don’t
say that it’s mine. I don’t want
to appear anywhere.
ALBERTO
Very well. Will you direct me?
SALVADOR
No.
ALBERTO
That would help.
SALVADOR
Give it to the people at the

decide if they’re interested in

Alberto is puzzled. Salvador drinks his coffee. They
get up and go over to the desk, next to the window that
looks out on the tree trunks. On the way, Salvador
gives him indications, serious.
SALVADOR
About the staging. A screen and a
chair if you don’t know what to do
with your arms and legs.
ALBERTO
I know exactly what to do with my
arms and legs.
SALVADOR
(Critical) After correcting it, I
admit that the text is a bit
melodramatic now.

Don’t worry, I can do melodrama.
My years in Mexico will come in
handy.
They sit on opposite sides of the desk.

SALVADOR
That’s why I’m telling you. You
have to avoid any sentimentality.
Control the emotion. Don’t cry.
Actors take any opportunity to
cry. The best actor isn’t the one
who cries but the one to fights to
hold back his tears.
Alberto realizes that Salvador can’t help directing
him. It amuses him and touches him. He stands up.
ALBERTO
Let me give you a kiss!
He takes Salvador’s face in his hands and gives him a
friendly kiss on the lips, a kiss of gratitude.
Salvador, motionless, lets him do it.

Alberto goes back to his seat across from Salvador and
dives into the text of Addiction with urgency. Without
taking his eyes off the text:
ALBERTO
I’m going to start working now, if
you don’t mind. You can stay, if
you like, make yourself at home.
(He points to the social area, the
couch and a table covered with
magazines.) By the way, I’ve got a
pile of magazines from the 80s,
you’re in some of them, dressed as
a woman.
Salvador smiles and shrugs.
ALBERTO
You soon forgot those times.
SALVADOR
First invite me. And give me the
address of your dealer. Tell him
I’ll go myself for the material.
ALBERTO
You don’t have to. They bring it
to your house now, like pizza.
Alberto opens a drawer and hands him the material, the
whole set.

iota of the emotion you’ve put
into these pages.
Salvador is pensive and he’s feeling the effect of the
drug. He thinks of the emotion, the pain and the
frustration he put down on those pages, and he doesn’t
understand what it is that attracts Alberto so much.

EL ESCORIAL. ALBERTO’S STUDIO. INT. DAY.

In the social area, Alberto is dozing in a comfortable
wing chair. Over his close-up we start to hear, with
increasing volume, the long instrumental introduction
to La vie en rose, in the disco version by Grace Jones.

The interior of the Sala Mirador, the stage
facing an amphitheater of ten rows of seats.

The images correspond to what Alberto imagines while he
reads the text: a rehearsal without an audience. A
theater employee in the background. We still hear La
vie en rose. Alberto dances in front of the white
screen. There is a large radio cassette on the floor.
The room is empty. When the musical introduction ends,
the actor turns off the radio cassette and continues
with the monologue.
ALBERTO
I met Marcelo in a washroom full
of people. It wasn’t the first
time I’d seen him, but it was that
night, after casually brushing
against
each
other,
when
I
discovered that I liked that boy.
We spent the whole weekend in bed
and, by the time I realized, a
year had passed and we couldn’t
live without each other. It was
1981, and Madrid was ours.
Cut.
78.

SALA MIRADOR. INT. DAY. (THE REHEARSAL CONTINUES)

Empty theater. The wall behind the screen isn’t black
now, it’s red. A large red surface surrounding the
white screen.
ALBERTO
One day I found Marcelo looking
paler than usual. Recently he had
lost weight and was drawn looking.
I asked him if he wasn’t feeling
well and he confessed that he’d
started
fooling
around
with
heroin. I was surprised because

I’d never taken it. I drank and I
snorted cocaine, like everyone,
but never heroin. I sensed that it
wasn’t good and I didn’t like it.
I was going flat out, I was
writing a nighttime chronicle, I
was
participating
in
music
programs. I prepared my first
film, I shot it, it was released,
it was a success, I wrote the
second, I shot it. I was doing a
thousand
things,
I
wasn’t
sleeping. Meanwhile Marcelo was
languishing on the couch at home
or shut away in the bathroom…
79.

EMBAJADORES NEIGHBORHOOD. EXT. DAY.

Federico is a man a little over 50, attractive. He
observes everything he sees as he walks along with a
nostalgic expression. He doesn’t seem like a tourist.
In fact, he lived in Madrid a long time ago and he is
looking at how the neighborhood has changed.
ALBERTO OFF
…or out of the house, somewhere I
didn’t know.
He arrives at a building. He looks at it closely, at
the windows. With his cell phone he takes a photo of
the façade and of one specific window.
ALBERTO OFF
I’d spend the night coming and
going
to
the
window,
always
listening for the sound of the
door.
Federico passes next to an alternative theater, the
Sala Mirador. It didn’t exist when he lived on that
street.
He looks at the posters announcing the work that is
being staged, Addiction, by Alberto Crespo, and also
performed by him. Federico knows him, something to do
with a past in Madrid which the spectator doesn’t know
for the moment.
He looks at his watch, the performance is starting in
fifteen minutes and it’s very short.

80.

SALA MIRADOR. INT. DAY.

The theater, a very intimate place, about 150 seats, is
packed. Although we only see Alberto, we sense that the
audience fills the theater. We hear him breathing.
On the stage, there is now a chair (a very light one)
and the general shot is more balanced, otherwise it
would seem that the screen is floating in space.
ALBERTO
Madrid had become a difficult
bullring, as bullfighting fans
say, so we traveled continuously,
anything so as to get out of
Madrid.
The first days were the worst.
While Marcelo was recovering from
withdrawal
symptoms,
I
looked
after him and wrote. I don’t know
how, but I wrote. Marcelo was very
young, the symptoms didn’t last
long, three or four days. Then
we’d go out on the street and have
fun, like children.
In the stalls, Federico, amazed, is watching closely
what is happening on the stage.
81.

SALA MIRADOR. INT. NIGHT.
ALBERTO
(Evoking) I remember the Ivory
Coast. Dozens of muscular, young
men, washing clothes in the river
on wheel rims, and spreading them
on the grass.

Photos are projected on the screen, illustrating the
text.
ALBERTO
I remember the Malecon in Havana,
by day and night. The women at the
windows of peeling buildings, with
magnificent pillars holding up
decades of scarcity and joy of
living. Old Havana, beating softly
to
the
rhythm
of
unceasing
percussions.

Images and the corresponding sound. And among the
spectators, Federico, captivated and astonished. Very
involved in the content of the monologue.
ALBERTO
I remember Mexico City. Marcelo
and I in the hotel room, drunk on
tequila,
listening
to
Chavela
Vargas singing The Night of my
Love.
The voice of Chavela Vargas resounds in the space, the
theater is too small for it. The spectators listen to
it, paralyzed, so does the actor, as if the song has
taken them all by surprise.
“I want the joy of a ship returning,
And a thousand bells of glory pealing
To toast the night of my love”.
Suddenly Alberto gestures to the stage manager to
interrupt the song, as if he doesn’t have the strength
to hold back the flood of tears caused by Chavela’s
voice. The spectator can’t know if that gesture is the
result of improvisation or if it’s been rehearsed
beforehand.
Impossible
to
know,
but
the
effect
increases the emotion of the piece.
In the audience, Federico gets a lump in his throat. He
can’t hold back his tears.
82.

SALA MIRADOR. INT. NIGHT.

Sitting on the chair, huddled up, tormented, in a soft
voice.
ALBERTO
Those journeys, the only reason
for which was to escape from
Madrid, to escape from heroin,
became my best school. On those
journeys I found inspiration for
the stories I would tell years
later and the colors that would
illuminate them.
But we couldn’t spend our lives
traveling. Sooner or later we had
to go back to Madrid. And Madrid

SALA MIRADOR. INT. NIGHT.

Alberto gets up, he brings the chair over to the front
row to speak more intimately to the spectators.
ALBERTO
I was desperate, I didn’t know
what to do, except repeat myself.
We both repeated ourselves for
three long years. I believed that
the strength of my love would
overcome his addiction. But it
wasn’t so. Love isn’t enough. Love
may move mountains but it isn’t
enough to save the person you
love.
He moves again to one edge of the screen.
84.

SALA MIRADOR. INT. NIGHT.

Alberto, split in two by the light that outlines and
projects his shadow on the white screen. The image
recalls the beginning of the monologue. He touches the
edges of the screen.
ALBERTO
Under the whitewashed wall where
the films of my childhood were
projected, I prayed that nothing
would
happen
to
the
leading
ladies, but I didn’t succeed,
neither with Nathalie Wood nor
with Marilyn. Then I tried to save
Marcelo
and
save
myself.
If
Marcelo was saved it was far from
me. And as for me… I stayed in
Madrid. And the cinema saved me.
The lights goes out, only the white screen gives off a
very intense light.
85.
SALA MIRADOR. ALBERTO’S DRESSING ROOM. INT.
NIGHT.
Federico knocks on the door of Alberto’s dressing room.

ALBERTO OFF
Come in.
Federico opens the door and goes in. Alberto and the
visitor study each other mutually.
In the light of the dressing room Alberto seems
different, calm, tired. He speaks with the calmness of
someone who feels realized. The two men have been
affected by the performance, both the actor and the
spectator and virtual co-protagonist.
FEDERICO
Good evening.
He doesn’t know how to begin.
ALBERTO
Hello. Do we know each other?
FEDERICO
Yes.
Alberto looks him up and down and likes him.
ALBERTO
I don’t remember you.
FEDERICO
It was a long time ago, when you
were
preparing
Sabor,
with
Salvador Mallo.
Alberto becomes aware of the situation. He hasn’t
recognized the visitor but he knows who he is. He lies:
ALBERTO
I don’t remember.
FEDERICO
We saw each other two or three
times. I’m Federico, the Marcelo
from your monologue.
ALBERTO
Did you like it?
FEDERICO
I don’t know. “Like” isn’t
word. It really affected me.

the

Alberto offers him a chair across from him, next to the
dressing table with make-up and in front of the mirror
framed by light bulbs. Stuck in the edges of the mirror
are lots of photos of Alberto, unrecognizable because
of the respective make-up and costumes. Half of the
space in the dressing room is taken up by a mixture of
bits and pieces from the theater, remains of other
plays. On the walls there is the poster for Taste and
one for Hamlet in its theatrical version.
Federico accepts the invitation and sits across from
Alberto, who covers himself with a maroon colored
dressing gown.
ALBERTO
Sit down. I imagine you want to
ask me some questions.
Federico doesn’t sit down.
FEDERICO
Is Salvador alive?
Alberto looks at him, thinking what to answer, and how
far he can go with his answers.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. BEDROOM. INT. NIGHT.

Sequences 86 and 87 alternate.
Alberto walks along the streets around the theater
while he calls Salvador on his phone. He’s probably
walking down the same street where Salvador lived with
Federico. Salvador is lying in bed, reading. He sees
that Alberto is calling him, he picks up the phone.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT. (CONT’D)

The news affects him deeply. He’d expected a call from
Federico during, at least, all of the 80s. Now that it
is a real possibility, it disconcerts him. He looks at
the phone, he has just hung up. And he starts that old
waiting, he remembers himself in that same situation,
waiting for Federico day after day, night after night,
year after year.
For a moment, he has the impression that his life has
been a mirage, that time has stopped to wait beside
him. He remains sitting on the bed, with the phone in
his hand, waiting for Federico’s call.
His phone rings. A call from a number he hasn’t listed,
with lots of figures starting with 5521.
FEDERICO OFF
Salvador?
SALVADOR
Yes.
FEDERICO OFF
Is that you? I wouldn’t have
recognized you. This is Federico.
SALVADOR
Federico!
He gets up and walks through the house while he talks
on the phone.
FEDERICO OFF
I’m in Madrid…
SALVADOR
Oh, and what are you doing here?
FEDERICO OFF
I’ve come to see some lawyers,
about an inheritance. I’m leaving
tomorrow night… and I’d like to
see you…
SALVADOR
I’d like that too.
He hesitates, disconcerted. He arrives at the window
that looks out on the terrace, next to the window full
of glass vessels.

SALVADOR
…But I was in bed. Do you mind if
we meet tomorrow?

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE/FRONT DOOR. EXT. NIGHT.

Sequences 89 and 90 alternate.
Salvador is at the window that looks out on the street,
next to the terrace. Out of the corner of his eye, he
sees a man in the doorway of his building. He can’t
make out his features, the man is talking on a cell
phone.
Salvador gets a lump in his throat. He doesn’t see him
clearly, but he knows that it’s Federico (Marcelo in
the monologue). Federico has had the delicacy to call
on the phone before turning up at his house. That
gesture touches him.
FEDERICO
Would midday suit you? I have a
meeting in the afternoon with the
lawyer.
SALVADOR
Perfect.
FEDERICO
I haven’t asked, how are you?
SALVADOR
Old.
FEDERICO
(Warmly) Five years older than me,
not one more.
SALVADOR
(Tenderly) And how are you?
FEDERICO
(Relieved) Better now. When I left
the theater I was devastated… I’ve
been seeing Addiction.
He says this as if he has just got through a very tough
test.
SALVADOR

How did you know it was on?
FEDERICO
By chance, I went for a walk
around the neighborhood, to take a
look at our street. I was outside
our house.
SALVADOR
(He is delighted and surprised.)
Ah…
Salvador is touched, as if
coincidence for the first time.

FEDERICO
I went in to pass the time and
because
I
remembered
Alberto

SALVADOR
And you found yourself, suddenly?!
FEDERICO
Yes. Suddenly!
Brief pause.
FEDERICO
(Honest, humble) I don’t know how
to apologize. I never imagined how
you were feeling, all that you
suffered.
Salvador looks at Federico in the darkness of the
street while he listens to his confession over the
phone: a man alone in the night, talking to the door of
the building, with his back to the deserted street,
asking him for forgiveness.
SALVADOR
It was a good school.
FEDERICO
What?
SALVADOR

Nothing.
You
don’t
have
to
apologize. I didn’t do anything I
didn’t want to do, Federico. I
tried to help you as far as I
could…
FEDERICO
And I’m grateful to you, and I’d
like to able to prove it to you
some day.
SALVADOR
Listen, I don’t think I’ll be able
to sleep after this. Will you give
me twenty minutes to get showered
and dressed and we’ll meet at my
place?
FEDERICO
Alright.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. BEDROOM. INT. NIGHT.

Salvador goes back to his bedroom. He opens the chest
of drawers. He has hidden the paper of heroin at the
back, camouflaged among the medicines, perhaps it’s in
a cassette tape. He prepares a little line of heroin on
top of the chest of drawers. He hesitates, he thinks
about what he’s doing. He thinks better of it and ends
up blowing the line away, its contents hang in the air
for an instant and disintegrate before they reach the
floor.
He chooses the clothes he’s going to wear. A shirt and
pants. He puts them on the bed.
Cut.
He’s dressed now. He puts on some loafers with the help
of a shoehorn some 30 inches long that saves him from
having to bend forward.
92.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

The house is in semi-darkness, as usual. In any case,
there is more light than when Alberto came. Low lights.
Only the paintings have their own directional light.
The entry phone buzzes.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT. NIGHT.

We hear the buzz of the entry phone. Empty kitchen.
Salvador comes in, dressed, and presses the button on
the entry phone. Then he goes out to open the door,
nervous, impatient, excited, uncertain.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. LANDING/DOOR/ELEVATOR. INT.
NIGHT
There’s no one on the landing. The elevator arrives
giving a little jolt, the door opens and Federico steps
out. Salvador is waiting for him with the door open.
Both smile. Federico walks to Salvador’s door. They
both have just enough time to scan each other (in the
short distance from the elevator to the door). Both
look in the other for some vestige of who they were
some 30-odd years before.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. DOOR (INSIDE). INT. NIGHT

They embrace. A sincere, intense, unhurried embrace.

joking)
Tequila? In honor of Chavela? I
couldn’t hold back my tears when
you mention her in the monologue.

from one of the cupboards.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. NIGHT.

They drink and talk sitting across from each other in
the two Cassina armchairs, near the terrace. On a
little auxiliary table, on a tray, the bottle of
tequila.
FEDERICO
I’ll give you a summary. After… we
separated,
I
stayed
with
my
parents for a year. At that time,
the heroin routes didn’t pass
through Argentina, so I went there
to my uncle. I started working
with him in his restaurant. I
couldn’t take heroin because there
wasn’t any. It was the best way to
quit.
He pauses.
FEDERICO
I met Lucrecia, we got married and
that’s it so far. Now I have my
own restaurant. I have two grown
sons and I only came back to
Galicia to see my parents. This is
the first time I’ve set foot in
Madrid… As you say in the piece,
Madrid had become a difficult
bullring for me, a minefield. It’s
a pity that you lived here.
SALVADOR
(Almost
apologizing)
I
needed
Madrid, I needed you too, but not
under those conditions.
FEDERICO
“Love isn’t enough to save the
person you love”. You say it in
your monologue.
SALVADOR
(Serious, sad) Let’s not talk
about the monologue, it’s a very
sad text.
FEDERICO

I felt a lot better when you said
that while you were looking after
me you continued to develop as a
writer and filmmaker. Did you
really feel like that?
SALVADOR
(Almost a declaration of love) You
didn’t
interrupt
anything,
Federico, on the contrary. You
filled my life like nothing and no
one has done until now.
He makes an effort to change the tone, more animated.
SALVADOR
So you haven’t been back in Madrid
since then…
98.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. DINING ROOM. INT. NIGHT.
FEDERICO
No. But I followed everything you
did. And I was delighted when I
recognized
a
scene
that
was
obviously inspired by us. Every
film of yours was an event in my
life and I was so proud that you
were a success all around the
world. You’re the only Spanish
director my family knows.
SALVADOR
Your new family…
FEDERICO
Yes.
SALVADOR
Do they know anything else?
FEDERICO
You mean about us?
SALVADOR
Yes.
FEDERICO
My wife… Well, my ex-wife, we’re
separating.

SALVADOR
Ah.
FEDERICO
I told her… She doesn’t know it’s
you… She knows I was with a man in
Madrid for three years. And I also
told one of my sons… to encourage
him… (He smiles.)
Salvador nods.
FEDERICO
With time I’ll tell him that it
was you. He’s a real film lover
and he’d never forgive me if I
didn’t tell him.
SALVADOR
And do you have a partner now?
FEDERICO
Yes. And you?
SALVADOR
No. A man or a woman?
FEDERICO
A woman, my experience
ended with you.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM/VIDEO LIBRARY. INT.
NIGHT.
In front of the television. On a couch and in front of
a coffee table. The sequence begins with a close-up of
Federico’s phone. On the screen we see a picture of one
of his sons. We hear Federico off screen saying his
name.
FEDERICO

This is Mauro, the younger one.
He slides his index finger over the screen. The older
son appears.
FEDERICO
This is Federico. He’s 22 now.
SALVADOR
He looks very like you.
FEDERICO
Yes. He’s the one I told.
Salvador is moved by the trust and by the resemblance
between father and son. It’s like finding the Federico
who left, the Federico that he knew and loved… He looks
at the Federico in the photo and at the one next to
him, his father. And indeed they’re identical, except
for the age difference.
SALVADOR
They’re both very handsome.
Salvador pours another two shots of tequila.
FEDERICO
(More relaxed) You have to come to
Buenos Aires. You’ll love the city
and I’m sure it’ll inspire you. I
want you to meet my family and eat
in my restaurant. We’ll get drunk
together.

Salvador and Federico hug each other tightly near the
door.
FEDERICO
For the old days.
He brings his lips to Salvador’s and they kiss for a
long time.
The kiss and the contact of their bodies arouse both of
them. Still embracing, their foreheads touching, each
one feels the other’s breath on his face.

FEDERICO
Do you want me to stay and sleep
with you?
SALVADOR
Of course I do, but we’re going to
close our story as God intended.
FEERICO
We never cared about God. And we
can close our story just as well
tomorrow morning.
Salvador shakes his head, he is disturbed by the kiss
and by what it has kindled in both of them.
SALVADOR
(He smiles to make light of his
words.) I’d delighted to see that
you still get aroused with me.
FEDERICO
Same here. You got aroused too.
SALVADOR
Yes.
Salvador opens the door.
FEERICO

But remember that you’ve promised
to come to Buenos Aires.
And he goes out.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. BEDROOM AND BATHROOM. INT.
NIGHT.
He comes into his room. Urgently, he takes the paper of
heroin from the back of the chest of drawers. He puts
it on the top and looks at it with delight.
He takes it, throws it down the toilet and flushes the
cistern.
104.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT. NIGHT.

On the worktop in the kitchen, under the painting by
Dis Berlin, Salvador gets ready to crush five different
colored tablets. In a close-up we see the tablets,
which are already covered by transparent paper. In the
same shot, a psychopath-sized knife, the phone and a
liter-bottle of liquid yogurt.
Salvador takes the knife and crushes the tablets with
the handle. When he has reduced them to a powder, or
almost, he calls Mercedes and puts the phone on
speaker. He is giving the last blows to the tablets
when Mercedes’ voice comes over the phone.
MERCEDES OFF

SALVADOR

HOSPITAL. PAIN UNIT. CORRIDOR. INT. DAY.

A sign next to the open door of the office says that
they are in the Pain Unit. Mercedes and Salvador wait
on some chairs. The wall behind them is totally covered
by wallpaper showing a very twee spring landscape, with
strident colors and without nuances, very digital.
On the ceiling there are four video screens with scenes
of white clouds crossing a blue sky. They create a
supposedly
pleasant
atmosphere
that
raises
the
patients’ spirits.
Salvador looks at the ceiling. He sits for a while
contemplating the clouds in a sky of an impossible
blue. The spectacle makes him smile. He remembers the
first time he entered the cave in Paterna and
discovered the sky through the skylight and called his
mother to come and see it.
A woman behind the reception desk gestures to them and
tells them they can go in.
107.
HOSPITAL. PAIN UNIT. DR. GALINDO’S OFFICE. INT.
DAY.

They go into Dr. Galindo’s little office. The three
know each other. Mercedes and Salvador sit on the other
side of the desk. The doctor is an empathetic man of
about 45. He transmits authority without effort. A film
lover. He has a photo of John Huston on the wall,
during the filming of The Dead, sitting in a wheelchair
and with a drip or a nose clip for oxygen. He treats
them with familiarity.
MERCEDES
Thank you for finding time to see
us, doctor.

A gesture from Mercedes confirms Salvador’s words.
MERCEDES
He’s been very depressed.
DR. GALINDO
What have you done to deal with
the pain?
SALVADOR
I’ve started taking heroin.
A moment of uncomfortable silence. The doctor looks at
him, surprised rather than scandalized. He knows that
Salvador is being serious. He looks at Mercedes’ face.
She remains silent. She found out the previous day
(although we haven’t witnessed this moment).
And… are

No, that’s why I’m here.
DR. GALINDO
How often did you take it?
SALVADOR
Every two or three days. In the
end, every other day, smoked on
tinfoil.
DR. GALINDO
When was the last time you took
it?
SALVADOR
The night before last. Will I have

DR. GALINDO

SALVADOR
Compassionate and controlled?
DR. GALINDO
Yes, that’s what it’s called. Do
you have anyone to help you?
MERCEDES
Yes. I’ll be with him.
DR. GALINDO
How have you controlled this day
and a half without it?
SALVADOR
With tranquilizers and a will of
iron.
DR. GALINDO
You’re going to need that will of
iron, because your mind knows the
effect of heroin now and that’s
something you don’t forget.
Those last words are engraved in the minds of Mercedes
and Salvador. The doctor looks in the computer at the

file with all the clinical
patient and his pharmacopoeia.

tone, more optimistic.

DR. GALINDO
I’m talking about work. It would
do you good to be busy. Don’t you

Mercedes looks at him in silence. She and Salvador have
already talked about this on several occasions and she
knows the answer. It’s a question that always hurts
Salvador.
SALVADOR
(Almost reproaching him) I think
about it every day. But it isn’t a
question of missing it or not.
Filming is very physical work, and
unfortunately I’m in no shape to
do it. As a matter of fact, that’s
my biggest problem.
DR. GALINDO
There are people who are much
worse than you and they get on

Salvador stands up.
SALVADOR
Do you mind if I go out to the
corridor and move around a little?
Salvador is very uncomfortable in every sense. He holds
out his hand to the doctor to say goodbye.
SALVADOR
Thank you, doctor.
Mercedes tries to hide it, but she’s upset by the turn
the interview with the doctor has taken.
108.
HOSPITAL. PAIN UNIT. CONSULTANCY. INT. DAY.
(CONT’D)
Mercedes and Dr. Galindo are alone. He starts to fill
out the prescriptions.
MERCEDES
There’s something else.
DR. GALINDO
Something else?
MERCEDES
Salvador chokes frequently. An
hour ago, when we were coming to
the hospital, he had a sip of
water and I thought he was going
to
choke
to
death.
The
gastroenterologist
did
an
endoscopy and he found a lump that

is pressing on his esophagus.
That’s why he chokes so easily.
(She touches her neck) And… we
don’t know what that lump is.
The doctor stops writing.
DR. GALINDO
Does he know?
MERCEDES
No. They’ve ordered a CAT scan to
be sure. The gastroenterologist
doesn’t rule out that it’s a
tumor… What do I do? Do I tell
him?
DR. GALINDO
No. Spare him at least two days of
anguish and call me with the
results of the CAT scan.
109.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. GUEST ROOM AND MOTHER’S ROOM.
INT. DAY.
The bedroom window has the same curtains as Salvador’s.
A painting of the Virgin of the Rosary by Murillo hangs
above the headboard. His mother, Jacinta, lived in this
room during the last months of her life, while she was
constantly in and out of hospital, four years before.
(There’s no way to know this, or perhaps there is.)
They open a closet. Salvador tries to take out a set of
sheets. Mercedes stops him.
MERCEDES
Let me do it.
SALVADOR
Pick the set you like most.
MERCEDES
Sit down, I’ll change the sheets.
Mercedes looks at a rosary on top of one of the bedside
tables, next to a photo of Salvador’s parents. Salvador
sits in his mother’s wing chair. He looks at the
bedside
table.
There
is
a
rosary
spread
out
deliberately,
a
framed
photo
of
his
paternal
grandparents and also a photo of his mother, Jacinta,
aged 30. And another of her with his father under
several strings of recently made chorizos and blood

sausages. On a lower shelf of the bedside table there
is a tin box, different from the one we saw in 1960,
but the same kind (where the mother kept her personal
mementoes).
The sequence ends with an insert of the photos and the
rosary on the bedside table.
110.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. GUEST ROOM AND MOTHER’S ROOM.
INT. DAY. (FLASHBACK. FOUR YEARS BEFORE)
The mother, aged 84, in the same room, is sitting in
the same wing chair. She looks at the bedside table and
then looks up at the bedroom door through which
Salvador appears, four years before (fewer grey hairs).
MOTHER
Give me the box, Salvador.
She’s talking about the tin box.
Salvador comes in with a snack on a tray. A glass of
milk and two dark colored madeleines on a plate. The
scene takes place with the natural light coming through
the window that looks out on a spacious patio.
Salvador leaves the snack on the bed and hands his
mother the tin box. It’s very pretty, a box of fine
confectionary from The Palace Pantry. A very intimate
scene.
SALVADOR
Here’s your snack.
MOTHER
I’m
not

madeleines.

SALVADOR
They’re wholegrain, mom.
The eternal battle.
MOTHER
One day you’re going to bring me a
plate of alfalfa to eat because
now they say it’s good for you.
Come on, sit here, on the bed.
Salvador insists that at least she has to drink the
milk. He sits on the edge of the bed, facing her. The

bed is covered with a large hand-crocheted bedspread.
Near the wing chair we see the stick on which she leans
to walk. (A gift from Salvador. A quality stick.)
The mother has already opened the tin box. All her
attention is focused on its interior. The box contains
a great variety of objects, religious or pagan, all of
great symbolic and sentimental value. There are two
entangled rosaries, a little hard-backed book inside
which there is a prayer to St. Anthony, several little
boxes with religious images containing neck chains with
a crucifix or things like that, a few scapulars, a very
old pen which Salvador’s father gave her. And the
wooden egg. There is also a white cloth in which the
widow’s veil is carefully wrapped.
The mother takes out the two entangled rosaries and
starts untangling them.
MOTHER
Do you remember how you have to
lay me out?
Salvador looks at her, ever so slightly fed up. They’ve
already discussed that subject many times.
SALVADOR
Yeees.
MOTHER
If we’re in the village, call
Petra, she’s used to it, and if I
die here, and I hope I don’t,
because I want to die in my own
bed, Maya and Mercedes will give
you a hand.
SALVADOR
Do we have to talk about this now?
MOTHER
Yes.
The mother leaves the rosaries, now separated, on the
bedside table and looks inside the box again. She takes
a white cloth, a simple remnant of white material,
which protects the folded black mantilla. She takes out
the black mantilla as if it was a ritual and covers her
head with it. Her face is now framed by the black cloth
which reaches her waist.

MOTHER
(As she puts on the mantilla in
the traditional way) On my head, a
half
mantilla,
because
I’m
a
widow.
Salvador helps her finish putting on the mantilla, the
ritual affects him more than it does his mother who
does and says everything in a totally natural way.
SALVADOR

of

The mother reminds him of the rest. She takes the more
used rosary and leaves the new one on the bedside
table.
MOTHER
That’s right, with its girdle. Put
a rosary between my hands. (She
shows him the one she has in her
hand.) Use this one, the old one.
I want you to keep the new one.
SALVADOR
Wouldn’t you prefer the new one?
MOTHER
No. And I want to go barefoot. If
they tie my feet to bury me, you
untie them and say I asked you to.
The place I’m going to, I want to
go in very lightly.
Even though he has heard it many times, Salvador is
always struck by those last words, light footed.
Jacinta takes an old pen out of the tin box. Salvador
sees in the box the wooden egg with which he remembers
her darning a sock the night they spent in the station.
JACINTA
Your father gave me this pen. With
it I wrote all my letters to him
when we were courting.
Salvador points to the wooden egg inside the box.
SALVADOR
And the wooden egg, mom?

Jacinta takes it out of the box.
MOTHER
I darned so much with this egg! Of
all these things it’s the one with
least value.
SALVADOR
Then give it to me!
Jacinta hands him the egg. She doesn’t understand what
it is about that particular humble object that makes
Salvador choose it over everything else, the pen, for
example.
MOTHER
Here, you’ve just inherited it.
Salvador holds it in his fingers and looks at it as if
it were a magic object.
111.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT. NIGHT (THE
PRESENT)
Salvador takes something creamy, a liquid yogurt or a
fine purée. It’s Mercedes who is eating a wholegrain
madeleine dunking it in her cup of tea. Just as Jacinta
liked to do, but with madeleines that weren’t
wholegrain.
SALVADOR
Recently I’ve been thinking a lot
about her.
MERCEDES
In Dr. Galindo’s office you said
that you still hadn’t got over
your mother’s death. I didn’t
know…
SALVADOR
When I’m dozing, which is most of
the time, I always end up thinking
about my mother and my childhood.
MERCEDES
But you never talked about her or
about
your
childhood
in
your
films.

SALVADOR
My mother didn’t like it.
MERCEDES
You think not?
SALVADOR
She told me one of the last times
she was in hospital.
112.

HOSPITAL. INT. DAY (FLASHBACK. FOUR YEARS BEFORE)

Jacinta, 84, is sitting next to the bed in an armchair
that allows her to stretch out her legs. She is hooked
up to a drip. Beside her, sitting on an imitation
leather couch, Salvador runs his fingertips delicately
over one of her legs. Despite her age, Jacinta’s skin
is smooth and white, like that of a young woman.
SALVADOR
Your legs are so clean, mother.
MOTHER
I took after my family in that.
There are no varicose veins in my
family.
She looks at him steadily, as if seeing right through
him.
MOTHER
What a pity, love!
SALVADOR
Why?
MOTHER
You’ll have a very bad old age.
You
take
after
your
father’s
family.
SALVADOR
Mom, the things you say! Come on,
tell me how you slept last night.
MOTHER
So-so. I was with my neighbor Lola
all night.
SALVADOR

(Very

surprised)

Here,

the

MOTHER
No, no, in dreams. I dreamed about
her all night. (Tone of someone
telling a story) I had just
arrived in the village, and I
heard Lola knocking on my door, as
always when she heard me arriving
back from Madrid. Even though it
was a dream, I remembered that
Lola was dead, but I opened the
door, and there she was, just the
same as ever, except that she was
a bit transparent. I wasn’t scared
and I said to her: Lola, I suppose
you’re not happy and you want me
to do something, but you have to
tell me what it is and I promise
I’ll do it. (She does the two
voices in the conversation.) No,
Jacinta, I’m happy, she answered.
But how can you be happy?, I said
to her. If you were happy, you
wouldn’t appear… I’m appearing to
you because my daughters would be
very scared.
Salvador listens to her carefully. He thinks that his
mother is starting to lose it (talking to the dead). In
any case, he thinks the story is delightful.
MOTHER
But why are you coming to the
village when it’s so cold? I don’t
feel
cold
or
heat
now,
she
answered, and there’s no better
place to be than in your house.
You’re right about that, I said.
Salvador encourages her to continue talking.
SALVADOR
What else?
MOTHER
Don’t get that storyteller look.
Don’t put this in any of your
films. I don’t like my neighbors

interview. My neighbors don’t like
you showing them, they think you

Salvador looks at her, astonished.
SALVADOR

say!
I
couldn’t treat them with more
respect or devotion! Whenever I
can, I talk about you and I say
that you and the neighbors made me
what I am. I owe everything to
you.
The mother shakes her head in a gesture that ends up
being funny.
MOTHER
They don’t like it.
113.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT. DAY. (FLASHBACK)

The house is almost the same as four years later,
perhaps there is a different painting in the kitchen.
The mother is sitting at the kitchen table.
SALVADOR
Let’s go for a walk, you haven’t
moved today.
MOTHER
(She protests) I haven’t moved
because I had nowhere to go.
SALVADOR
Well, now you do. Come on.

MOTHER
Where?
SALVADOR
To the hallway.
Jacinta is not in a good mood.
Salvador leads her by the arm, the mother taking very
short steps, down the long hallway (metaphor for time)
that crosses the house, where four years later her son
will walk from time to time. As well as on her son’s
arm, the mother leans on a stick.
Suddenly, Jacinta breaks the silence, without acrimony,
which makes it even more hurtful.
MOTHER
You haven’t been a good son.
Salvador looks at her, stunned.
SALVADOR
No?
MOTHER
No. You never forgave me for
recommending you to the pious
woman in Paterna. And I think you
took revenge for that. I didn’t
want you to go to the seminary
either, but we were poor.
SALVADOR
(Without getting upset, but hurt)
It’s true that I didn’t want to
go, but from that to wanting to
take revenge on you… How can you
think that?
Cut.

you wanted me to live with you.
You wriggled out of it, you said
you were living a life that you
couldn’t share with me.
SALVADOR
And it was true. But not as you
understood it.
Salvador is surprised and upset by Jacinta’s restrained
cruelty.
MOTHER
I understood it perfectly. (I’m
very bad on my feet, but my mind
is as clear as a bell.)
SALVADOR
When I wasn’t traveling, I was
filming. You couldn’t have put up
with the solitude of an apartment
in Madrid. That was no life for
you.
MOTHER
I’d have looked after you. I’d
have adapted as I’ve adapted to so
many things. But you didn’t want
it. And that hurt me.
Jacinta is very firm, without raising her voice.
Salvador’s eyes glisten, he’s on the verge of tears.
SALVADOR
Mom, I’m very sorry I was never
the son you wanted. When you used
to say “Who has that child taken
after?”,
you
weren’t
exactly
saying it with pride. And I
realized. I failed you, simply by
being as I am. And I’m very sorry.
The mother doesn’t answer, she maintains a dignified,
cruel silence. She doesn’t give an inch. It seems that
the confession (and the provocation it implied) have
unburdened her.
115.
SALVADOR’S HOUSE. GUEST ROOM AND MOTHER’S ROOM.
INT. NIGHT. (FLASHBACK. FOUR YEARS EARLIER)

Salvador covers his mother with the eiderdown. Mother
and son are closer than in the other sequences.
MOTHER
Pass me St. Anthony.
Salvador takes a holy card of St. Anthony from the
bedside table.
SALVADOR
Here.
MOTHER
I’ll pray for you tonight.
SALVADOR
Thank you.
MOTHER
Salvador, I brought you into this
world and I slaved so you could
get ahead.
SALVADOR
I know, mom.
MOTHER
(Pleading) Take me back to the
village. That’s my last and only
wish.
An explicit, firm wish that doesn’t allow for a common
sense answer: that she is sick and that whether in the
village or in Madrid she’ll be constantly in and out of
hospital.
SALVADOR
Very
well.
We’ll
go
to
the
village. With Maya, so she can do
the housework. I’ll look after you
day and night. This time I won’t
fail you, mom.

Yes, but she wanted to die in the

117.

HOSPITAL. RADIOLOGY WAITING ROOM. INT. DAY

Mercedes and Salvador wait outside the radiologist’s
office. To kill time (and to distract him), Mercedes
shows him the invitations she’s brought from her house
and some mail.
MERCEDES
You’re invited to give a talk in
Iceland. It’s well paid.
SALVADOR
I don’t understand how they
like me so much in Iceland.

can

MERCEDES
Neither do I.
There is an invitation from a second rate gallery for a
group exhibition. The work that illustrates the
invitation, on one side, shows a boy, bathed by an
overhead light, surrounded by flowerpots, reading a
book, on a floor of hydraulic tiles.
MERCEDES
I didn’t throw it out because I
think the drawing has something.
Salvador looks at it, shocked. He starts to talk but
just then he’s called.
118.
HOSPITAL. CAT ROOM (COMMUNICATED WITH A LITTLE
GLASS WINDOW) INT. DAY.
Salvador closes his eyes and breathes. He lets his mind
wander as he slides inside the tunnel that projects the
radiation. The bangs at the beginning (as noisy as if
his own brain was provoking them) fade away. His mind
connects with Paterna, when he was a happy child, at
the start of the ‘60’s. We start to hear Mina’s voice
singing Come sinfonia.
119.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY. (1966)

The cave in which Salvador lives with his parents is
much more presentable than in the earlier memories,
although there is still some chipping and peeling. The
floor is leveled out with cement which joins up the
various patches of hydraulic tiles. There are beds in
the two “bedrooms”. Instead of doors, there are
curtains made with a combination of various scraps of
material sewn together. In the little patio, under the
skylight, there are several flowerpots with plants,
geraniums, etc. And a large earthenware jar, almost
three feet high, full of drinking water.
At that moment, the mother has gone to sew at the home
of the village’s pious woman, and the father is
drinking in the bar. It’s Sunday.
Eduardo, the young builder, is putting the last touches
to a surface of hydraulic tiles, above the two sinks,
which are now finished. He is dirty and sweaty, he’s
wearing short work pants and a white vest. There’s an
empty cement bag. Salvador-child hears him working.
He’s sitting in the patio, under a blazing sun that
comes through the skylight. On the worktop by the
sinks, a little transistor plays a song of the time,
Come sinfonia, sung by Mina.
Salvador is absorbed in his book and doesn’t realize
that the sun is beating down on his head and shoulders.
EDUARDO
(Tapping the tiles gently so they
stick to the wall) Hey, when’s
your mother coming back?
SALVADOR
At lunch time. When she goes to
sew at the pious woman’s house she
stays there all morning.
Eduardo finishes with the tiles, he wipes his hands on
his pants and turns to Salvador who is reading. He
looks at the scene in detail: the boy reading, the
overhead sunlight, the pots of red geraniums on the
floor and hanging on the walls, the hydraulic tiles
forming figures on the floor. The whole thing, together
with the song, is a composition of Impressionist
beauty. He takes a piece of brown paper which had been
wrapped around the bags of cement and puts it on a work
table, with trestles, on which he had stood to paint
the ceiling. He takes some pencils from a bag.

EDUARDO
Don’t move…
Salvador doesn’t move, he concentrates on the book,
obedient. He doesn’t realize that his head is burning.
Eduardo draws some lines on the brown paper. He pauses
on the boy’s eyes. With rapid strokes he captures the
oval of Salvador’s face, his uncombed hair, the bulrush
chair, the flowerpots, the floor… During the process he
gives instructions to Salvador, who obeys without
objecting. The silence and Mina’s song create a very
intimate atmosphere. When he finishes the first stage
of the drawing, Eduardo gets up and shows it to
Salvador.
EDUARDO
What do you think?
The boy looks at the drawing.
SALVADOR
It’s lovely.
EDUARDO
I still have to finish it. I’ll
take it home and do it.
It’s the same drawing that Mercedes has just shown
Salvador, printed on the invitation.
Cut.
120.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY.

Near the kitchen, on the floor, there is a basin full
of water.
EDUARDO
Do you mind if I get washed? Look
at the state I’m in.
He hasn’t dirtied just his clothes with the building
material, but also his arms, hands, etc. Salvador goes
to his parents’ room and brings him a bar of soap.
SALVADOR
Here.
EDUARDO

Thank you.
Salvador doesn’t feel well. He goes to his room and
lies down on the bed while Eduardo undresses. In the
half light of the bedroom, Salvador’s cheeks, very red,
gleam with sweat.
Under the same overhead light which lit the child
before, Eduardo, naked, pours water all over his body
which gleams palely. He uses a plastic container for
this.
From his room, lying on the bed, Salvador listens
perturbed to the dull sound of the water against the
hydraulic tiles, after sliding over the builder’s naked
body.
When Eduardo finishes washing, he shouts to him:
Salvador!

EDUARDO

The boy gets up from his little bed and goes to his
parents’ room. He takes a towel from a pile of clean
clothes piled up on two chairs.
He goes out to the hallway and looks into the patio.
Eduardo’s naked body is gleaming under the light from
the skylight.
Salvador drops the towel. He bends down to pick it up
and when he tries to straighten up he feels dizzy and
collapses on the floor.
Cut.
121.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE.BEDROOM. INT. DAY.

Salvador lies on the bed. Eduardo is sitting at his
side, on a low chair. He touches his cheeks and
forehead, worried.
EDUARDO
You’re burning up! You must have
got sunstroke.
Eduardo’s body is damp, his hair is wet and his wet tee
shirt is sticking to his torso.
They hear the door.

122.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY. (CONT’D)

It’s Jacinta, the mother. She comes in, laden with
clothes to sew from the village’s pious woman, and a
bag with some shopping. She drops it all on the floor,
alarmed by what she sees, Salvador lying on the bed and
Eduardo sitting next to him. From the door:

EDUARDO
He got a lot of sun.
The mother comes into the room. Eduardo stands up.
She looks at him, with the wet clothes clinging to his
damp body. The mother doesn’t like the image of the two
boys. That complicity. During the rest of the sequence,
she is surly with Eduardo, as if she suspected
something.
SALVADOR
I was reading…
MOTHER
(To Salvador) Didn’t you realize
that the sun was shining on you!
(She touches his forehead.) You’re
burning up!
SALVADOR
I didn’t realize…
MOTHER
(To
Eduardo)
And
you…
(She
restrains from saying what the
hell are you doing here) What?
Eduardo remains standing, looking at them, not really
knowing what to do.
EDUARDO
I’d finished putting up the tiles
in the kitchen and, as he fainted,
I brought him here. I didn’t want
to leave him on his own.

MOTHER
(More alarmed) You fainted?
SALVADOR
A bit. I got dizzy…
MOTHER
Don’t get up. I’m going to get a
vinegar
poultice
for
you.
I
suppose your father’s in the bar!
SALVADOR
Yes.
MOTHER
He told me he’d stay in the house!
The mother is annoyed with the father. She picks up the
bag with the shopping and leaves the bag with clothes
to be sewn on a chair. She is tired and she doesn’t
like the situation.
123.

PATERNA. FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY. (CONT’D)

She goes off to the kitchen, near the patio, followed
by Eduardo.
MOTHER
What’s that basin doing here?
The basin with soapy water is in the same place as when
Eduardo was washing.
EDUARDO
I washed myself a bit.
Jacinta goes over to the kitchen, takes a cloth and
starts to soak it in vinegar. Reproachful:
MOTHER
You could have waited till you got
home. It’s hard work for me
carrying water here.
EDUARDO
I was really dirty. I’ll bring a
basin and dry the floor.

Eduardo goes to take the basin of water. He tries to
ease the situation, he’s proud of his work and he hopes

The woman nods slightly.

Thank you.

Jacinta watches him leave, without changing her
expression. She goes to Salvador’s bedroom, with the
cloth soaked in vinegar. When she passes the builder’s
table, she finds the drawing of Salvador sitting on the
chair reading and surrounded by geraniums. She feels
sick to her stomach.

HOSPITAL. RADIOLOGIST’S OFFICE. INT. DAY (THE
PRESENT)
The radiologist is sitting on one side of the desk (we
saw her earlier in her cubicle, when she was doing the
CAT scan), Mercedes and Salvador are across from her,
tense,

First of all, I want to reassure
you. There is no tumor. That is
totally discounted.
Salvador and Mercedes sigh with relief.
SALVADOR
But there’s something wrong with

The radiologist shows him various cervical sections on

radiologist’s words. Salvador and Mercedes look at her,
paying great attention.
RADIOLOGIST
You see this white part, next to
the vertebra? It’s an osteocyte,
an ossification. (She points.)
Here you can see the esophagus,
displaced by that ossification.
There’s practically no room for
food to get through, not even
liquids. That’s why you choke.
Salvador and Mercedes listen very closely.

RADIOLOGIST
Forestier’s Syndrome is a rare
disease and we don’t know what
causes it. We know it affects the
tendons,
ligaments
and
joint
capsules, which calcify, but we
don’t know why. In your case the
anterior ligament of the spine has
calcified.
Salvador and Mercedes look closely at the X-rays.
SALVADOR
And can anything be done?
RADIOLOGIST
Surgery, that ossification has to
be removed as soon as possible.
But don’t worry, it isn’t a risky
operation. The gastroenterologist
and the surgeon will explain it
much more detail.
125.

GALLERY. INT. DAY.

They go through a large, treeless patio. The gallery is
a glassed-in area, with an awning. Almost all the
paintings can be seen without going inside. The
exhibition is called Popular Art.
Salvador and Mercedes go into the glassed-in area. The
picture they’re interested in is seen immediately.
Mercedes and Salvador go up to it. Salvador, hiding his
emotion, looks at the watercolor and the glass
protecting it reflects him. We can see the two
Salvadors, the one who was the child teacher and the
present day one.
The person attending to the public comes up to them.
The owner, probably. A man with a French accent.

There’s something written on the

artists who probably don’t even
know that they are artists.
126.

STREET IN MADRID. INSIDE THE VAN. INT./EXT. DAY

Salvador turns the drawing over. (We suppose that he
has previously removed the frame.) There is a

dedication on the back. Salvador recognizes Eduardo’s
childish writing. We hear the contents off screen in
Eduardo’s voice.
EDUARDO OFF
Dear Salvador, I’m sending the
drawing to your home because I
don’t have the address of the
school. I’m happy to be able to
write to you. You taught me and
I’m very grateful. I’m working now
in Conchita’s uncle’s store and
I’m good at numbers. All thanks to
you. It’s nice here, but I miss
life in the caves. And you, in
particular. Every time I write I
think of your hand guiding mine.
I’m sure you’re learning a lot at
school, reading lots of books and
seeing lots of films. I’m giving
you my address in Bilbao. Maybe
you can write and tell me.
Your
pupil.
(Signed)
Eduardo.
(Followed
by
an
address
in
Bilbao).
Salvador is touched by the dedication. Mercedes looks
at him without saying anything.
127.

SALVADOR’S HOUSE. INT. DAY.

The drawing is part of the desk. We hear the song Come
sinfonia sung by Mina. The same song as was playing on
the transistor when Eduardo drew Salvador, fifty years
before.
From the start of this sequence we hear the sound of
typing on a computer. Salvador is writing quickly, as
if he were short of time. We see the title at the top
of the document: THE FIRST DESIRE.
As well as hearing Mina’s song, we see it, on the
screen of Salvador’s cell phone, a YouTube video, in
black and white, from that time.
Mercedes comes into the study area. She seems him so
deep in concentration that she doesn’t want to disturb
him. She loves to see him writing.
Salvador is writing very quickly on the computer. He
looks at the clock.

MERCEDES

neutral)

Salvador, without pausing in his writing:
SALVADOR
Remind me just before.
His expression has changed, he’s a different Salvador,
calm, he writes with ten fingers, he doesn’t need to
look at the keyboard.
128.

STREET IN MADRID. INSIDE THE VAN. INT./EXT. DAY.

On the way to the hospital.
Salvador is looking out the window at life in the city.
He is serious. A middle-aged father pushing a double
pram with a set of twins. A South American woman
helping an elderly lady to walk. The shouting of a
group of adolescents, several people with dogs, men and
women isolated by headphones or talking on their
phones.
MERCEDES

MERCEDES
Are you going to try to find him?
SALVADOR
Eduardo?

MERCEDES
It’s easier now, with Google. Or
going back to Paterna and asking
about him.
SALVADOR
Fifty years later? (He shakes his
head.) It’s a good idea for a
story and maybe I’ll write it, but
looking for him would be crazy.
MERCEDES
How on earth did the drawing get
to the Flea Market in Barcelona?
SALVADOR
No idea. By chance, but what
matters is that it got to the
person it was intended for.
129.

HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER. INT. DAY.

Some nurses wheel Salvador in on a gurney. General view
of the operating theater.
Dr. Galindo is the anesthetist, he goes over to the
gurney. They greet each other amicably. Salvador is
reassured by the doctor’s presence. The atmosphere is
typical of an operation.
DR. GALINDO
(In a mask and cap) How are you,
Salvador?
SALVADOR
Hello, doctor.
DR. GALINDO
I heard. No wonder you couldn’t
swallow. But don’t worry, we’ll
get rid of this right away.
Salvador smiles. Despite

He says it in the tone of “and I’d like to keep doing

DR. GALINDO
(Injecting the anesthetic) Really?
That’s great news! I’m delighted,
Salvador. Drama or comedy?
SALVADOR
I don’t know. You don’t know that…
He is about to say “until the end” but the anesthetic
traps him sweetly before he can finish the sentence.
130.

TRAIN STATION. EXT. NIGHT. (1966)

From that colorless, painless place, we start to see
the railway tracks in the train station converging in a
knot and spreading out like a cobweb. Salvador’s voice
says off screen:
SALVADOR OFF
In the 1960s, many Spaniards had
to emigrate in search of fortune.
I went with my mother to Paterna
where my father was waiting for
us.
Cut.
131.

TRAIN STATION. INT./EXT. NIGHT.

Fireworks explode in the night sky. The boy, standing
at one of the doors of the hall/waiting room of the
station, is looking, bewitched, at the delight of the
fireworks, rockets exploding and spreading out like
branches of different colored palm trees.
Jacinta’s voice comes from inside the hall, weary, fed
up, calling him.
MOTHER
Salva, come and help me.
The boy goes up to his mother. Outside, the orgy of
fireworks continues until it ends in a catharsis that
floods the celestial surface.
132.

TRAIN STATION. WAITING ROOM/HALL. INT. NIGHT.

The mother spreads a blanket on the floor to make a
bed. Outside the orgy of fireworks continues. They are
surrounded by bundles. The boy lies on the wooden
bench, wrapped in a blanket and with a bundle as a
pillow. The mother lies on the makeshift bed on the
floor. She is staring into space, probably trying to
imagine their future. In that relaxed tone that
precedes sleep, mother and child talk:
Mom, will

The boy rolls over, turning his back on his mother.
Jacinta thinks of the destiny that awaits her family.
In her eyes there is uncertainty, fear and hope.
The camera starts to pull back.
133.
TRAIN STATION. WAITING ROOM. INT. NIGHT. (THE
PRESENT)
The backward tracking shot slowly shows us Salvador’s
past and his future/present, coexisting in the same
space.
We see the tracking rails, the sound technician, with
his arms raised, holding the mike boom, some LED
screens on the floor illuminate the actress playing the
mother, Penélope Cruz, absorbed, staring into space
thinking of what lies ahead for her character.
On the opposite wall, surrounded by part of the film
crew, present day Salvador looks intensely at the video
screen with which he controls the shot he’s filming. He
looks like he’s controlling his emotions.
SALVADOR
Cut.
ASSISTANT
We’ve cut.
Penélope Cruz comes out of her character and recovers
her own appearance. As an actress she’s aware that
destiny, at least that of her son in the story, is

there, in the other half of the waiting room. The
represented past and the present coexist separated only
by the rails of a little tracking shot.
Sitting on the blanket, Penélope looks over at
Salvador, the director. She knows what this scene
represents for him and she looks for his complicity and
approval. Salvador is wearing sunglasses to protect his
eyes from the light and to hide his emotion. Esther
appears on one side and stands in the center of the
frame to chant the clapperboard she’s holding.
ESTHER
38, 5, first. Final clapper.
Among the details usually written on the clapper (name
of the camera operator, of the director, etc.) we can
see the title of the film Salvador is shooting: THE
FIRST DESIRE.
The screen sinks into a long fade to black until the
credits start.
THE END.
