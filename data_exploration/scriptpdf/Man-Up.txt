1.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE HOTEL - NIGHT
The vague sound of Hawaiian music coming from inside. A man
and woman, dressed in party clothes but also wearing Hawaiian
leis, stumble out of the entrance, and drunkenly begin to
snog. We follow the music inside where we find INT. COUNTRYSIDE HOTEL - NIGHT
C/U on DOM and KATIE, mid-30s, landing a big kiss on each
other’s lips. Pull out to reveal a huge banner: ‘HAPPY
ENGAGEMENT, DOM AND KATIE!’ and a large party of cheering
friends and family. A Hawaiian band strike up their unique
version of David Bowie’s ‘Modern Love’. The party revellers,
all wearing leis, Hawaiian shirts etc are getting into the
spirit of it all.
We move through the party, past loved up couples, hopeful
singles... and then it starts to get a bit messier, with new
hook ups chatting each other up after one too many mojitos.
We find a particularly amorous couple sneaking out of the
party and follow them into the lift. As the doors close on
them, they start to kiss. ‘Lift going up’.
INT. COUNTRYSIDE HOTEL/LIFTS - NIGHT
Ping! ‘Doors opening’. The lift doors open to reveal the
couple now really going for it, rolling out of the lift,
heading towards their hotel room, passing by a door that has
the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign up... which we stop at, letting the
couple continue on their journey. For we have reached our
destination. The couple stumble into the room next door, but
we go inside this room, to find INT. COUNTRYSIDE HOTEL/ROOM - NIGHT
... as the camera travels through the hotel bedroom door,
where we see the feet of NANCY PATTERSON, 34, the heroine of our movie, taking a mini
bottle of red wine from the mini bar. The camera tracks with
her feet, as she walks around to the dressing table. She
plonks herself down in front of the mirror. She is wearing
her party dress, hair done, make up on. As we cut to the
perspective of the mirror NANCY
(determined/sports like)
Come on!
Nancy nervously fidgets with her small purse, putting in a
lipstick, taking out the lipstick again, stuffing some
tissues in, leaning into the mirror to smile - she has
lipstick on her teeth - she takes the tissues back out, wipes
her teeth down.

She stops, relaxes, clears her throats, smiles a brilliant
fake smile. She puts her hand out, like she’s shaking
someone’s hand NANCY (CONT’D)
(trying some things out)
Hi! Hello. Howdy. Hey there. Hola.
How you doing?
(searching for some more
‘H’s)
H-h-h-eeeee-oooooo-aaaaaaa...
The ‘aaaaaaa’ turns into her singing a harmony of ‘h’s. Nancy
kind of likes it. But she stops singing, bangs her chest,
pumping herself up again. Ouch, that hurt. She fakes smiles
again.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Ryan, right? I mean, not Ryan
Right. Or maybe you are Ryan Right.
Either way, you’re the right Ryan
for me.
(horrified with herself)
Oh my god.
(she resets)
Hello Ryan, I am Nancy.
(beat)
And I am a robot.
She slaps herself around the face. She does some breathing
exercises - inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. She pops a mint
in her mouth, leans seductively forward.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Oooohh, that is so interesting,
really? Wow. I did not know that,
Ryan. Oh god, stop it, no way, that
is too fascinating She nearly chokes on her mint NANCY (CONT’D)
Excuse me one moment.
She spits it out in her hand. Chucks it in the bin. She
sprays some perfume, resets again.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Okay. You can do this. Just got to
put yourself out there, see what
happens, not get too drunk.
She zips up her purse.
NANCY (CONT’D)
And you’re going, you’re going...
She picks up a lei and puts it around her neck.

NANCY (CONT’D)
(as she goes)
And you’re gone!
Nancy disappears from view. We hold for a beat on the empty
mirror...
... then Nancy suddenly sits back down, taking her lei off
and chucking it in the bin.
NANCY (CONT’D)
(to camera)
Fuck it.
We hold on the same empty frame, looking out of the bathroom
as TITLE ON SCREEN: MAN UP
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Nancy, now slumped on the double bed, wearing tracksuit
bottoms, a hoody and a pair of cat slippers. Her dress is
hung up in the corner of the room and she is munching from a
large bag of crisps and drinking from a small bottle of wine.
On the hotel television screen, ‘Silence of The Lambs’ plays.
Nancy is transfixed.
CLARICE STARLING
There’s a very nice beach, terns
nest there, there’s beautiful Nancy takes another sip of her wine, and starts to quote
along with the film NANCY
Terns? Mmmmm. If I help you
Clarice, it will be ‘turns’ with us
too. Quid pro quo, I tell you
things, you tell me things. Not
about this case though. About
yourself. Quid pro quo, yes or no.
There is suddenly a loud knock at the door. Nancy jumps.
Pauses the film. Goes to the door.
AT THE DOOR:
She opens it to reveal ROOM SERVICE BOY, with his trolley.
Hi -

ROOM SERVICE BOY

MAN UP - Tess Morris

NANCY
(cutting him off, ushering
him in)
Right, yes, good Room Service Boy rolls in, forcing Nancy into the room as
well.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Yes, lovely. Great.
She has nowhere else to go but the bed, so sits down in front
of the trolley, at the end of the bed.
Room Service Boy reveals Nancy’s food - a huge, double decker
burger and chips, with all the trimmings - side salad, onion
rings, melted cheese, bacon, gherkins etc...
Room Service Boy smiles, politely. Nancy stuffs a chip in her
mouth, then clocks Room Service Boy’s name tag.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Tell me, Andrew... Andy, can I call
you Andy? How’s the party going?
ROOM SERVICE BOY
Oh, pretty well I think.
(beat)
You know there’s food down there?
NANCY
Yeah, I do, I do. I’m just not in
the party mood tonight.
Nancy lifts up her burger bun, takes a massive bite. Her
phone starts to go. As she answers it, with a mouthful of
burger NANCY (CONT’D)
Have you got any ketchup, Andy?
(down the phone)
Hello.
EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
ELAINE, Nancy’s older sister, confused by Nancy’s pick up.
ELAINE
Who’s Andy?
NANCY
A very nice young man who has just
bought me dinner.
Andy hands Nancy a pen for a signature.

MAN UP - Tess Morris
ELAINE
You’re not at the party.
NANCY
(signing for Andy)
I am not at the party, but I am at
a party. Hannibal and Clarice are
here, not to mention Andy of course
Andy’s job is done, and he starts to go.

NANCY (CONT’D)
But he’s just leaving now.
ELAINE
Put him on, please.
NANCY
(shrug, calls after Andy)
Hey, my sister wants to speak to
you.
ROOM SERVICE BOY
(very confused, taking the
phone)
Hello?
Back with Elaine:
ELAINE
(to Room Service Boy)
Hi, I’m Elaine. Now, there’ll be a
dress, hanging up somewhere, can
you give it to her please?
Back with Room Service Boy:
ROOM SERVICE BOY
(seeing the dress)
Ah, yes, of course.
Nancy watches Room Service Boy go over to her dress NANCY
No, no, no... Andy.
ELAINE
Tell her to put some make up on as
well.
Back with Nancy:

ROOM SERVICE BOY
(handing her the dress)
She wants you to put some make-up
on?
Outraged, Nancy gets up and takes the phone from Room Service
Boy.
NANCY
Okay, enough.
(to Andy)
Andy, do you have a napkin or
something?
(to Elaine)
I’ve been ambushed, Elaine. Some
set up, with a bloke Katie works
with.
ELAINE
Excellent. This is good.
Nancy leans on Room Service Boy for her lament NANCY
Come on. It’s just all so
organised, and awkward, you know I
can’t bear it Elaine ELAINE
Yeah I know, Nance but...
(beat)
How the hell else are you going to
meet someone?
NANCY
Well, I met Andy?
Room Service Boy, scared for his life, legs it.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Oh no, he’s off. Put on the Do Not
Disturb sign please!
ELAINE
(shouting out)
Don’t do it, Andy! Take her with
you!
Nancy flops down on the bed.
ELAINE (CONT’D)
You’ve gone all the way down there,
just put your dress on, go and
show your face, stay, like ten
minutes Nancy interrupts:

MAN UP - Tess Morris

NANCY
The party is themed, Elaine.
ELAINE
Oh god really? Okay, get your
notepad.
Nancy rolls her eyes, rolls over and picks up her notepad.
NANCY
I’m too old for this shit.
Back with Elaine and Adam:
ELAINE
You’re 34 not 84!
Nancy flips open to a page that used to say ‘MANTRAS’, but
Nancy has crossed the ‘M’ out so it now says ‘NANTRAS’. She
sits up straight, determined.
NANCY
(deep breath)
Put yourself out there.
Good -

ELAINE

NANCY
Take chances...
ELAINE
Okay, now a little less hollow and
robotic...
HARD CUT TO:
INT. COUNTRYSIDE HOTEL/LOBBY - NIGHT
- the lift is coming down from the floors above - PING! ‘doors opening’ - and there is Nancy, big game face on, out
of her hoody and in her pretty dress NANCY
(looking at the open lift
doors)
Get stronger thighs.
(she does a little squat ouch)
A HOTEL GUEST enters the lift just as she’s squatting.

leaning on the Hotel
Guest)

NANCY (CONT’D)
Be more deviant. Learn French. Cook
more!
The Hotel Guest looks at Nancy, who is now peering out of the
lift doors, into the lobby NANCY (CONT’D)
(to the hotel guest)
Understand the Israeli Palestinian
conflict better.
‘Doors closing’ - Nancy is either in or out... she looks at
the Hotel Guest - she’s out! The doors close. She steadies
herself from her lift encounter and strides confidently over
to the party doors NANCY (CONT’D)
(to herself, final mantra)
Engage with She kicks the doors open, game face back on, to find:
The hotel bar. The party is in full swing, there are couples,
everywhere.
NANCY (CONT’D)
(to herself, heart sinking)
- life.
DOM, 34, our groom to be, sweeps in, and starts to hula
around her DOM
Finally! We nearly sent out a
search party!
NANCY
Call them off!
Dom drapes Nancy in a lei, grabbing a Mojito from a passing
waiter.
DOM
Here, have a mojito, the first one
is free! I paid for them all with
my savings! And now, I have no
savings!
Nancy reaches into her handbag and pulls out a small wine
bottle from the hotel mini bar.
NANCY
Happy Engagement. Here is literally
a small present.
DOM
I am so touched that you thought of
me when you raided the mini bar.

MAN UP - Tess Morris

Nancy pulls out a pack of peanuts from her back pocket, hands
them to Dom.
DOM (CONT’D)
(mock emotional)
Oh my god, this is too much As KATIE, Dom’s 34-year-old, slightly manic wife to be,
swoops in KATIE
What’s too much? Tell me, tell me!
Nancy, you look amazing.
(to Dom, eek!)
He’s going to love her! Come on Katie tries to pull Nancy away NANCY
Whoa, whoa, I just need a moment
longer with this Mojito, please KATIE
He hates Facebook, loves yoga
and he’s really creative. He’s KATIE
- perfect for you.

NANCY
- perfect for me, I know, I
know.

DOM
(encouraging)
Oh come on (wrapping his arm around
Katie)
- we were a set up, and look at us
now!
NANCY
Dom, it’s like your single years
have been totally wiped from your
pea brain memory (beat)
Hey, remember that girl who cried
the whole way through giving you a
blow job?
A very awkward beat as Nancy realises that it was Katie who
cried the whole way through the blow job NANCY (CONT’D)
And look at you now!
Katie glares at Dom who gives her an apologetic smile. He
soldiers on.
DOM
Come on Nancy, give him a chance?

A party guest knocks into Nancy, spilling her drink onto her
hands. As Nancy dries her hands off NANCY
Alright! Bring it on! Another sad,
single loser in their mid thirties RYAN (O.S.)
- I’m actually a sad single loser
in my late thirties.
Nancy swivels around to see RYAN, 37 - a generic, handsome
guy, smiling away at her. Katie laughs a bit too loudly at
Ryan’s ‘joke’ - looks at Nancy - come on, laugh! She pulls a
repentant Dom away, we hear them squabble as they leave.
KATIE
I was crying with happiness!
Nancy and Ryan shake hands Ryan. 37.
Nancy. 34.

RYAN
NANCY

Nancy realises her hand is a bit wet NANCY
Sorry, my hand is a bit wet. It’s
not wee.
Right.

RYAN

NANCY
It’s Mojito?
RYAN
Oh, I didn’t think it was wee NANCY
I mean, why would it be wee? That
would imply very poor personal
hygiene. I don’t use my hand. I use
toilet paper, just like everybody
else RYAN
That’s... a relief?
NANCY
And so is a wee!
An awkward, zero chemistry pause.

MAN UP - Tess Morris

RYAN
(attempted brightness)
How about another drink?
NANCY
(even brighter/faker)
Why not?
As Nancy takes a long slurp of her drink, Ryan turns to the
bar and starts to get his wallet out NANCY
I’ll get these RYAN
No really, it’s fine Let me -

NANCY

RYAN
No, no, seriously NANCY
Oh okay, thank you -

RYAN
Oh alright, you get them -

RYAN
(so awkward)
I’ll just get them, shall I?
Nancy notices a photograph of a girl in Ryan’s wallet.
NANCY
Ah, busted. Still carrying a photo
of your ex around in the old
wallet.
RYAN
That’s my sister.
NANCY
Oh, well, she’s very pretty. Bet
she gets all zee boyz RYAN
She’s dead.
Ryan, bemused by Nancy, snaps his wallet shut.
NANCY
Wow! This is going really well.
Nancy drains her Mojito dry.

EXT. TRAIN STATION/TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING
Nancy on the busy platform. Feeling rougher. In one hand she
is carrying a bag from the station cafe, filled with her
unique hangover cure. In the background, a poster for a self
help book - 6 Billion People and You - but blink and you’d
miss it. Nancy’s train arrives.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Nancy makes her way down the aisle, now on the phone.
NANCY
No Elaine, I have pictures of my
cats in my wallet, and they’re
alive and kicking, and I want
people to ask me about them.
EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
Elaine and Adam, coming out of their flat, carrying canvas
bags full of crisps, Pringles, nibbles galore.
ELAINE
(on the phone to Nancy)
But it’s good that you went Back with Nancy: who has just plonked herself down opposite a
GIRL ON TRAIN.
NANCY
Why, why is it good? It’s just so
excruciating and predictable, like
it always is. You know what, I’m
just going to let my vagina
hermetically seal up.
ELAINE
Yeah, well that will really help.
NANCY
Never hurt Barbie. She’s got a
beach buggy, and horses, and a
salon Back with Elaine:
Directing Adam where to put everything in the boot of the car
ELAINE
(smiling/encouraged)
And a boyfriend, actually Back with Nancy:

NANCY
Is she still with that guy? Such a
fake smile.
Back with Elaine:
ELAINE
(laughing)
So how long you going to be?
She moves a bag Adam has put in the wrong place.
ADAM
(leaning into the phone)
Oi! Get your arse over here pronto,
we have a lot of nibbles, to put in
a lot of bowls.
Back with Nancy:
NANCY
(smiling)
About two hours?
As the train announcer’s voice booms out into the train TRAIN ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
- just a reminder to all passengers
that due to weekend engineering
work, no trains are currently
stopping at Clapham Junction...
NANCY
About 7 hours.
Back with Elaine:
Slamming the boot shut ELAINE
What the fuck NANCY
I’m joking ELAINE
Well, not funny. I cannot do this
all on my own As Adam dips down to get into the driver’s seat.
ADAM
Hey, you’re not on your own!

ELAINE
(ignoring Adam)
- and whatever you do, don’t forget
the chocolate mousse, Mum’s
obsessed. And have you done your
speech yet Back with Nancy:
NANCY
Yeah, I mean I’ve got a rough
draft...
Back with Elaine:
Opening the passenger seat door ELAINE
- or have you just done a lot of
doodles and crossing out?
Back with Nancy:
As if!

NANCY

Back with Elaine:
She waits to get into the car ELAINE
Come on, favourite daughter, you
know Dad loves it when you do a
speech. So it needs to be good, and
special, okay?
Back with Nancy:
NANCY
Mmmmm, fine.
And Nancy?
Yeah?

ELAINE
NANCY

Back with Elaine:
Elaine sits down in the passenger seat, door still open.
ELAINE
Don’t seal up just yet.
(beat)
It will happen for you. Soon. I
promise.
Back with Nancy:

MAN UP - Tess Morris

15.

NANCY
Yeah yeah, fuck off.
Nancy hangs up. She glances back at the Girl on Train, who is
now reading a copy of that self help book - 6 Billion People
and You - A Guide To Meeting Your Mate In The Modern World.
Nancy looks at it, can’t help rolling her eyes to herself.
Girl on Train catches her doing it. Nancy looks down at her
notepad, flicks back to her mantras. She considers them,
dismisses them, remembers something, gets out a pen, writes
‘Black Pant Wash’ snaps her notepad shut, looking up to find
Girl On Train leaning towards her, sympathetically GIRL ON TRAIN
Sorry, but I couldn’t help overhearing (re the book she’s holding)
You should really think about
reading this.
Nancy considers the back of the book now - it reads ‘This
book will change your life!’.
NANCY
(got this girl’s number)
Oh, right, right... did it, then?
GIRL ON TRAIN
Did it what?
NANCY
(gestures to tagline)
Change your life?
GIRL ON TRAIN
Oh...
(smugly)
...maybe, yes.
NANCY
Or maybe not as well?
GIRL ON TRAIN
Well, I like to give everything a
go otherwise, what’s the point? I
mean, you’ve got to hope it’s going
to work, haven’t you? Because what
is life without hope? Death!
NANCY
Death it is, then!
GIRL ON TRAIN
You see! You do need to read it. I
would lend it to you but... I need
it for my date.

MAN UP - Tess Morris
NANCY
Why do you need a book for a date?
GIRL ON TRAIN
So we can recognise each other.
NANCY
(condescending)
Oh, is it a set up? Well, they
always work.
GIRL ON TRAIN
They often work. If the match-maker
has done their homework NANCY
Yes, yes, because all successful
relationships are built on the fact
that you’re both the ‘outdoorsy
type’ GIRL ON TRAIN
(irked, quite loud now)
I really think you should read
this.
NANCY
(louder back)
Don’t need to.
GIRL ON TRAIN
It was an international best-seller
NANCY
So was the Da Vinci Code GIRL ON TRAIN
Also an excellent book!
NANCY
Not an excellent book.
GIRL ON TRAIN
I think it’s exactly what you need The argument (and volume) escalates NANCY
Why is everyone always telling me
what I need!
GIRL ON TRAIN
Perhaps if everyone is telling you,
you should listen -

NANCY
And I think you need to shush, you
need to shush your mouth GIRL ON TRAIN
You want me to NANCY
I do, yeah, it would be great Girl on Train tries to speak again GIRL ON TRAIN
I’m only suggesting NANCY
It’s time. I think we’re done.
Nancy puts her finger to her lips - quiet time now please and Girl On Train, clearly not quite finished with Nancy,
goes back to her book. Nancy takes a bite of her sandwich,
munching a bit aggressively, annoyed with how that all ended.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
The train is now pulling into Waterloo Station. Nancy has
fallen asleep, her face all squashed up on the seat. She
wakes up to find everyone is getting off the train TRAIN ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
arriving at our final destination,
London Waterloo...
Nancy yawns luxuriously awake. But then glances down at her
table to see - the Girl on Train’s copy of 6 Billion People
and You. There is a napkin with a smiley face drawn on
sticking out the top of it - Nancy, infuriated, flicks to the
page it’s book-marking. The chapter reads ‘YOUR NEGATIVE
THOUGHTS ARE RUINING YOUR LIFE (AND EVERYONE ELSE’S...)’
As Nancy looks up to see the Girl On Train, waving gaily at
her, walking off down the carriage. No way. Nancy is
definitely not having that! She furiously picks up all her
stuff, including the book, and charges after Girl On Train,
who has now picked up her pace. Nancy manages to get off the
train INT. WATERLOO TRAIN STATION - DAY
- and first we’re at the ticket barriers. Nancy tries to get
through, to catch up with Girl On Train, but her ticket beeps
in denial.

MAN UP - Tess Morris

18.

Furious and frustrated, she hands it over to the ticket
inspector, as he beeps her through and we go with Nancy as
she now legs into the busy concourse of Waterloo Station,
searching for the Girl on Train like she’s the white rabbit,
but to no avail. In a flash, we see Girl On Train striding
confidently into WHSmith, where a huge display of 6 Billion
People and You sits in the window... and a long queue of
people all waiting to pay.
Back with Nancy, still determined not to lose this battle,
scanning the crowds for her quarry. In frustration, she flips
the book over - reading the tagline on the back - ‘what are
you waiting for?’. Taking it personally she looks up,
suddenly furious NANCY
(shouty)
Damn it, where the fuck are you?!
JACK (O.S.)
Blimey, I’m not that late!
Nancy spins around to see - JACK, the hero of our story, 40
and charming as hell.
JACK (CONT’D)
Somebody threw themselves on the
tracks again. I don’t blame them,
so many delays!
Nancy is totally confused - why is this man talking to her?
This rather nice man, who is now holding up his own copy of 6
Billion People and You.
JACK (CONT’D)
And by the way, great idea for how
we’d know each other. Although you
would have been pretty hard to miss
under this clock.
Nancy looks around - what the fuck is going on? She looks
back at the book, the penny drops NANCY
Oh no, I’m not, this isn’t JACK
- should we shake hands or kiss?
Oh come on, we’re all adults here!
Jack leans in and kisses her on the cheek. It’s a quick kiss,
but Nancy feels herself swooning. This man is really nice.
Her phone starts to ring. ‘ELAINE CALLING’.
JACK (CONT’D)
Oh my god, is that your emergency
exit phone call already?!

JACK (CONT’D)
I’ve barely had a chance to use my
good lines yet!
(a beat)
That wasn’t one of them.
He grins at Nancy, who starts to smile back before Jack
suddenly swipes the phone from her.
JACK (CONT’D)
(answering the call)
Hello there caller! So, I’m not a
psychopath, we’ve really hit it
off, and she’ll call you later with
all the gory details! Bye for now!
And with that, Jack hangs up the call, handing Nancy her
phone back JACK (CONT’D)
Right. Book. Check. Clock. Check.
Blind date... check?
Nancy gulps. She looks at the book, then the clock, and then
Jack JACK (CONT’D)
So, after I’ve spoken, usually you
speak, we exchange ideas for the
evening ahead, swap notions of what
to get up to (Hannibal Lecter
impression)
Quid pro quo, Clarice.
Nancy is visibly thrown by Jack’s Lecter impression - who is
this man, who is tweaking all her verbal nipples?
JACK (CONT’D)
(misinterpreting Nancy’s
look)
With hindsight, possibly not the
best impression to do on a first
date.
(another beat)
Anyway, listen, I’m talking, I’m
talking a lot, and I know you can
sense it, so I’m just going to keep
going with that, and start the
bidding with a drink on London’s
fashionable South Bank?
(holding his book up)
So, er... what are you waiting for?
Nancy looks up at the clock, and at all the couples
underneath it, meeting and greeting each other -

NANCY
I am waiting for...
(she looks down at the
book, then back at Jack)
You?
Good!

JACK

A totally bemused Nancy lets Jack lead her away from the
clock, the crowds engulfing them... and then we see Girl on
Train, hurrying to get to the clock, carrying a WHSmith bag,
from which she takes out a new copy of 6 Billion People and
You.
INT. WINE SHOP - DAY
BERT, Nancy’s Dad, is standing with Adam, looking at the
shelves of wine. Their trolley is so far filled with boxes
of cheap lager. In another part of the shop - Elaine looking at her mobile phone, a bit confused.
BERT
What do you think, good stuff for
the first few hours, descending in
quality as we do?
ADAM
I’d go quality and quantity, Bert.
It’s a massive night.
Bert thinks.
BERT
You’re right, we bloody deserve it.
Bert moves on to the 5.99 shelf. Nods at it.
BERT (CONT’D)
Let’s go mental.
They start stocking the trolley.
ADAM
Seriously, you do deserve it, I
mean, I don’t know how you’ve done
it (beat, backtracking)
Not that I don’t intend to go the
distance myself, obviously BERT
I think the trick is get through
the first thirty, forty years and
then just kind of... give up. From
that point on it’s a breeze.

MAN UP - Tess Morris
Bert gives Adam a cheeky wink to Adam, who returns it.
BERT (CONT’D)
No, I’m serious.
FRAN, Nancy’s Mum approaches, pushing a trolley.
FRAN
(clocking Bert’s trolley)
How we getting on?
BERT (RE ADAM)
We are nailing it.
Adam salutes Bert.
FRAN
Well that’s great.
(To Adam)
Put two of the boxes of lager back
Adam.
Adam salutes Fran. Puts the boxes of lager back
Elaine wanders over, holding her mobile phone, looking a
little perturbed. She is standing the other side of the
display unit.
FRAN (TO ELAINE) (CONT’D)
What did Nancy say, what does she
want to drink?
ELAINE
Well I’m not sure if she BERT
She’ll want vodka. The only spirit
she can out-drink me on. But we’ll
see about that later FRAN
No, we won’t.
ELAINE
Guys? She didn’t even answer her
phone, some man did. Sounds like
she’s on a date.
They all look at her - WTF?
FRAN
With the man from last night? I
thought it didn’t work out.
ELAINE
No it didn’t work out, it was a
disaster.

I don’t know, Dad. He said he

Not really darling no.
Elaine looks ‘faux’ upset
ELAINE
Oh that cut me deep, that cut me

As he opens his notepad to a specific page, holding it out,

INT. BLOOMSBURY BOWLING LANES - NIGHT
A hot and steamy BOWLING MONTAGE.
SMASH! C/U on some bowling pins. Someone is getting an
awesome strike. And that someone is Nancy, ecstatic to be at
a bowling alley. And this is no ordinary bowling alley. This
is cheesy, tacky, retro heaven, with a 1960s’ style diner,
staff dressed in American bowling style outfits.

Nancy seductively picks up another bowling ball, turning it
around in her hands, as she watches Jack’s fingers erotically
tap his beer bottle. She sidles up to their lane, taking an
extra bit of time to move her arse around a bit, pretending
to line herself up to take a shot. Jack appreciates the view.

Nancy stretches her legs out on the semi-luxurious seats,
watching Jack’s hands weighing up two bowling balls, which
could well be her breasts in her mind.
Jack pokes his fingers one by one into a bowling ball. Nancy
lets her beer bottle linger a little bit too long over her
lips. Jack takes his shot, and then drops down to the floor,
lying on his side in a nonchalant position - yup, it’s
another strike.
Nancy takes a shot, and as she does, she slides onto her
knees, and then on to all fours, y’know, to see if she gets a
strike. She does. Still on all fours, she turns her head to
wink at Jack. It’s sexual cliché heaven and they’re loving
it. Unbeknownst to them, a bowling party of young kids has
witnessed the whole thing.
As our hot and steamy bowling montage comes to an end, Jack
and Nancy, now pretty drunk, and clearly digging each
other...

Oh god, where?
Nancy runs her finger along her teeth JACK
Up a bit? No. Left. Left a bit
more. Right. It’s sort of...
wedged... nearly... no!
NANCY
I’m just going to nip to the She motions to the ladies’ toilets.

JACK
I’ll wait here.
(winks)
Think about what we can get up to
next.
Nancy looks at the clock on the wall. 8.45pm. Yikes. Jack
tightens his scarf around Nancy’s neck again - Nancy swoons.
NANCY
(re the toilets)
And I’ll go in there.
(winks)
Think about what we can get up to
next.
Jack’s eyes light up, as Nancy skips into INT. BLOOMSBURY BOWLING LANES. LADIES TOILETS - MOMENTS
LATER
- the ladies toilet, a sexy spring in her step. She goes
over to the mirror, next to a couple of other girls, who
are immaculately reapplying their lipstick. Nancy leans in
to the mirror, picking at the jalapeno in her teeth. The
girls look at her sympathetically, and exit. Nancy gets
the Jalapeno out of her teeth - result - looks around,
checks there’s nobody else in there to see her NANCY
(to herself, mimicking
Jack’s sexy tone)
What do you want to do next, what
do I want to do next She pretends to dry hump the sink when suddenly, from
underneath the cubicle nearest to her - a hand grabs her
ankle. Nancy screams as she looks down to see... Sean
looking up at her.
NANCY
Fucking hell Sean!
SEAN
I saw you were about to leave, so
I took my break early.
NANCY
(feigning innocence)
Leaving? I wasn’t leaving...
Sean’s head disappears, and the toilet door swings open. He
is wearing just his socks and some tiny pants.
NANCY
Sweet baby Jesus.

SEAN
Not yet!
(a pause)
I left my socks on, because it’s
always a strong look on a man.
Always.

NANCY

As Nancy turns on her heel to leg it SEAN
Okay, well I’ll just put my clothes
back on and go outside and have a
little chat with ‘Jack’ about
‘Jessica’ Chastened, Nancy turns back.
SEAN
(puckering up)
Where do you want to land those
luscious lips?
Sean gyrates around a bit. Nancy looks around the toilets.
Somebody help? No, nobody.
NANCY
We’re leaving the door open.
SEAN
Now you’re talking!
Nancy takes in Sean’s physique. It could be worse.
SEAN
(pumping his guns)
From fat to fit, right?
Nancy pokes one of his arms, actually quite impressed.
SEAN
- and these babies have had
15 years of dating Pamela Handerson(Nancy doesn’t react)
Going Hans Solo on Darth Vader’s
helmet (still nothing from Nancy)
I have been wanking a lot.
Sean throws Nancy’s scarf over his shoulders, wrapping it
around the back of his head, pulling the scarf so that Nancy
is pulled towards him. He starts to sing Phyllis Nelson’s
‘Move Closer’.
SEAN
Will you hold my face?

MAN UP - Tess Morris

Why?

48.
NANCY

SEAN
It will make it more romantic.
NANCY
I don’t think this could be any
more romantic, Sean.
Sean looks pleadingly at Nancy. She reluctantly reaches her
hands up to Sean’s face, as he can’t believe his luck. She
is just about to kiss him, when he suddenly spins her
round, dropping her down in a dramatic embrace, pulling one
of her legs around his back.
Jessica?

JACK (O.S.)

Nancy scrambles to look over Sean’s shoulder - but their
necks are bound together now by the scarf - to see Jack
standing there. Nancy is entwined with a half naked Sean.
This does not look good.
SEAN
(not missing a beat)
Hey man.
Jack!

NANCY

JACK
(totally thrown)
You’d been gone a while, so I
thought maybe I should come and
find you NANCY
- what is happening here is
definitely not what you think is
happening here.
Nancy starts to move, but the scarf situation means this
results in Sean coming with her. From behind.
JACK
I think I’m just going to leave.
NANCY
(pulling the scarf off)
No, wait! Let me explain!
Sean grabs to pick up the scarf JACK
(it’s clearly not okay)
It’s okay!

thinking it’s Nancy’s)
Jack, chill man.
(he puts his arm around
Nancy territorially)
Don’t be so harsh on Nancy JACK
Who’s Nancy?
Sean looks at Nancy. Oops!
JACK
Why is he calling you Nancy?
SEAN
It was my other pet name for her!
NANCY

They look at each other. Then put their arms around each

Nancy suddenly can’t help nearly laughing. The absurdity of
the situation is finally getting to her.
JACK
I am gonna go.

as any to confess JACK
Confess what?
NANCY
(pulling herself
together)
The reason Sean just called me
Nancy.
(smiling at the
ridiculousness of it all)
It’s because I’m not called
Jessica! And the reason I am not
called Jessica is because I am
not actually Jessica.
Sean puts his arm around Nancy again.
SEAN
She’s Nancy. Nancy Patterson.
NANCY
Okay, you can put your clothes
back on and leave now Sean.
SEAN
But my kiss Go!

NANCY

Sean grabs his clothes and exits, inhaling Jack/Nancy’s
scarf to his face as he does. A beat as Jack realises Sean
is going off with his scarf, and then NANCY (CONT’D)
(chatting away)
Anyway, I was in here with him
because he said he wouldn’t tell
you who I really was if I kissed
him. Because I’m not really your
blind date, Jack. But you thought
I was, what with the book, and
the clock and quid pro quo...
(off Jack’s confusion)
I was watching it last night! So
sue me, I went with it! And then we
started having such a nice time JACK

earlier?

NANCY
I know, it does sound a bit mad!
But don’t think mad, think...

stands waiting under a clock in
order to steal someone else’s
blind date?
NANCY
(overlapping with Jack)
I wasn’t waiting under the clock
and it wasn’t stealing in the
conventional sense of the word,
that girl gave me her book! Which
is why you thought I was her JACK
- I thought you were her because
you said you were her!
NANCY
But did I actually say that?
JACK
- and when were you planning on
telling me the truth about this
frankly quite psychotic decision of
yours?

Well, there wasn’t really a plan in

Because who would have a plan for
something like this!

Jack turns and storms out, as does Nancy INT. BLOOMSBURY BOWLING LANES - CONTINUOUS

the cloakroom.
NANCY
I think you’re over-reacting just a
little bit As they get to the cloakroom window JACK
How would you feel, Nancy? You’ve
been set up to meet someone who
is meant to be absolutely perfect
for you As a HOPEFUL LOOKING TEENAGE BOY appears at the cloakroom
window.
JACK
- but you don’t get to meet them,
because some psycho pretends to
be them instead?
Jack aggressively takes a ticket out of his back pocket,
handing it over to a now slightly crest fallen Hopeful
Teenage Boy, who is transfixed by their conversation.
NANCY
Firstly, ‘set ups’? They never
work out, and ‘b’ JACK
Tom said we matched!
NANCY
Oh pleeeeease. She reads selfhelp books and the Da Vinci Code,
and works in the city. What does
that even mean??

Well, at least I’m nearly at my
sexual peak! It’s all downhill
for you now, Hefner! Knock knock,
who’s there, Viagra!
As they both look at the now horrified Hopeful Teenage Boy,
who scurries off to get their stuff.
JACK
Wow. The bitter look really suits
you. No wonder Pete slept around
on you... Oh wait... there is no
Pete.
NANCY
And there is no wife. Because she
left you. ‘Oh, I’m so wounded,

anniversary JACK
Oh this just gets better and

stand up your parents on one of the
most important milestones of their

Getting a cab back to the bar.

No it’s not, it’s like 20 minutes NANCY
What are you talking about, it’s 10

You seem pretty confident about

Great, brilliant JACK
I tell you what, here’s an idea.
Why don’t you run, swim and cycle

You don't even know what a
triathlon is!
Yeah I do!

NANCY

JACK
Oh you do, do you? Well, ready,

Go!

Nancy, taking her cue, immediately starts to run. The taxi
starts to pull away. Having some fun with this, Jack waves at
Nancy lightly - bye bye! - then turns to look out the back
window, tapping his watch - tick tock, tick tock! As ‘Bust a
Move’ by Young MC starts to play NANCY
(as she runs, determined)
Get. Stronger. Thighs.
Nancy starts to run. And not just any old run. A focussed,
almost triathlete like run. Steady, eyes on the prize,
through the side streets of London. Nancy gets to a main road
- a group of girls - a hen party! - block her way - she
starts to wade through them, in a breast stroke fashion.
She’s basically swimming now. She gets through the crowd,
picks up her running pace again, a little tired, but not
deterred.
Jack, in the taxi, triumphant at first... then hitting some
late night Soho traffic.
Nancy goes down an alleyway, pops out the other side - sees a
row of bikes locked up, various owners milling around bingo! As she saunters over with purpose, and next - Nancy is now on one of the bikes - she clearly used all her
charms - and cycling furiously through London town.

briskly towards the cantina, still carrying his notepad - just as a dishevelled, sweaty, puddle-splashed Nancy comes
cycling around the corner, pulling up right by Jack - wheel

NANCY
In your 40-year-old face!

Nancy dumps the bike in a Boris rack, and suddenly throws up

A beat as Jack checks his watch, looks ominously at the
door to the bar.

Of course it will be in there.

who downs it herself, smiling over at Fran, who is laughing
at Bert, eating a mini pizza, proudly demonstrating that his
change of jumper is still slob-free.

phone, on a nearby table switching to answer machine INT. MEXICAN CANTINA/THE TOILETS - NIGHT

freshener. Gives her underarms a quick spray. That’s better.
She has pulled herself together. Sort of.

Jack is scanning the bar again, checking his watch. As he
turns to look towards - Nancy exiting the toilets. Jack
does a double take at her - god, she looks quite lovely. As

(to Hilary, touching her
nose)
Don’t worry, babycakes Nancy - to herself - ‘babycakes?!’
ED (CONT’D)
- this was bound to happen sooner
or later.
HILARY
(to Nancy, condescending)
You’ll find this with him. He’s a
very emotional man.
Ed puts a protective arm around Hilary. Nancy considers them,
then to the waitress NANCY
We’re going to need some more
nibbles.
The waitress nods - no shit - and goes off. Nancy turns to
Hilary and Ed once more.
NANCY
So you two had an affair, right?
Hilary and Ed stiffen.
HILARY
We fell in love.
NANCY
But you had an affair?
ED
The marriage was over, anyway.
NANCY
But you had an affair?
Hilary and Ed are forced to nod.
NANCY
Yup, he sure is an ‘emotional’
man.

As the waiter brings some more nibbles to the table, Nancy
scoops them all towards herself, and starts eating them. Jack
comes back from the toilets. He’s calmed down.
JACK
(about to come clean)
Okay. Sorry about that. The truth
is, Hilary Nancy suddenly runs her finger seductively down Jack’s arm.
NANCY
I missed you, Big Nuts.
Jack looks at Nancy - WTF? Nancy leans in and gives him a
seductive kiss on the neck. A pretty sexy one. Jack, mouth
open now - Nancy pops an olive from the nibbles tray in it,
gives him a wink.
NANCY
(to Hilary and Ed)
What rating are you two rabbits
on now?
Rating?

HILARY

NANCY
Sexually speaking? We’re still in
porno land.
Jack spits his olive out. Nancy seamlessly catches it in
her hand.
HILARY
Porno land?
NANCY
(to Jack,
conspiratorially)
Shall I explain?
Please do!

JACK

With impressive aim, Nancy chucks the olive stone onto a
passing waiter’s tray.
NANCY
At first, when a woman starts
sleeping with a man, she acts
like a porn star right?
Hilary and Ed look blank NANCY (CONT’D)

Ed and Hilary still look baffled.
NANCY

Remember that time when you said we

scared, because I couldn’t see. And
then you flipped it, and did that

Jack Ed nearly chokes on his drink NANCY
- yes, Jack, don’t stop Jack, do
what you do Jack, thank you Jack, I
love your work.

reverting back to normal)
And you lot (she gestures to Jack and

pyjamas to bed, doing the goodnight

Jack and Nancy clink glasses. But Hilary looks at Ed - he
clearly did that to her.
NANCY
I mean, if divorce papers were

‘irreconcilable differences’. It
would say ‘just not enough blow

Ed shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Hilary has had enough.
It’s time to shut this down.

NANCY
Hey Jack, it’s our song! Maybe we

Jack looks at her - WTF - as she swiftly pulls him up,
dragging him onto the dancefloor, where the DJ is currently
playing ‘Move Closer’ by Phyllis Nelson.
JACK
What are you doing?!
NANCY
Stopping you from making a twat of
yourself using the medium of dance.
Nancy puts her arms awkwardly around Jack’s neck, who looks
at her, WTF?
NANCY (CONT’D)
I’m going to slow dance you into
submission. It’s called ‘school
disco therapy’. You need to put
your arms around my waist for it to
work properly.
Jack goes with it, responds accordingly. They awkwardly dance
together, as Jack glances back at Hilary and Ed.
JACK
(annoyed with himself)
I’m such a dick.
NANCY
You’re not a dick.
(beat, looking over at
Hilary and Ed)
You know it’s always better to be

You never have to regret anything

they have to live with that for the

JACK
It’s not as simple as that.

It will be. Just takes time. Your

NANCY
And what, about twenty grand, all

Oh, and let’s not forget the ring!
JACK

Four grand! But we had to get it resized. She got very thin.
NANCY
You spent twenty four thousand

In the background, Daniel The Barman has relieved the DJ from
his post, and begun to spin ‘The Reflex’ by Duran Duran.
Nancy and Jack both note the song playing, and clearly love
the song, but JACK
You’re such a fucking cynic!
NANCY
Er, realist?! And you’re such a
fucking romantic!
JACK
Er, optimist!
In total unison as the song plays JACK
(double hand flash
movement at Nancy)
- flex, flex, flex, flex,

NANCY

The song continues, as does the argument, which is fast-paced
and frenetic NANCY
You put so much emphasis on one day
and forgot about whoops! - the rest

What’s wrong with having a big
day?! That doesn’t mean it’s all
going to go tits up! Look at your
parents! I bet they had a party,
and some guests and a Wishing Tree NANCY
6 guests, registry office, drinks
in the pub afterwards! They were
more concerned with the promises
they were making than how many
vegetarians there were JACK
Do you not think that’s what I
wanted to! When you get married,
you make a promise you have no idea
if you can keep, but I intended to
at least try! And I’ll never, ever
regret that. Which is more than you

They’re not judgements! They’re

now really start to dance to, unable to contain their love
for the song, but determined to carry on the debate. It’s
basically a dance-fight-off.
JACK
You know what your problem is? You
stand around on the sidelines,
‘theorising’ on what does and
doesn’t work, never experiencing it
for yourself, never taking any
chances NANCY
I think my actions today could be
considered quite ‘chancey’ JACK
(dancing around Nancy)
- you need to man up Nancy! Yes, I
married that woman over there, and
yes she tore my heart out, but I’m
still standing, still offering
myself up to the world! Who are you
to say that the girl I met under
the clock tonight - the girl I was
supposed to meet under the clock
tonight - wouldn’t have ended up
being the love of my life?
Jack does one final dramatic dance move. Nancy, totally

An upset Jack storms off into the men’s toilets, leaving a
shocked Nancy, alone on the dancefloor with ‘The Reflex’. She
looks around at everyone having a great time, forgetting
their worries, dancing away, and suddenly feels very bad. She
looks over to the Men’s Toilets - The Hombres...
INT. MEXICAN CANTINA/THE TOILETS - NIGHT
Nancy pops her head into the HOMBRES’S TOILETS. A row of
men standing up against the cisterns. The men all turn to
look at her, confused by her presence.
NANCY
Hola, I’m new here.
Nancy starts to casually clean the very smeared mirror with
her sleeve. The men turn back to their cisterns.
NANCY (CONT’D)
(cautiously entering)
Jack? Are you in here?
No!

JACK (O.S.)

She dips down, looking under the cubicles.
NANCY
Oh come on...
She sees Jack’s shoes. She moves towards his cubicle JACK (O.S.)
Just go home. I’m fine.
NANCY
You’re fine?
JACK (O.S.)
Absolutely fucking fine.
Nancy pushes open the cubicle door but It’s not Jack. It’s a RANDOM MAN taking a crap.
NANCY
Whoa! Sorry!
She dips down again, sees a pair of exactly the same shoes.
She tentatively pushes this cubicle door open to find Jack, who has clearly been crying.
NANCY (CONT’D)

Oh, I was hoping for the socks

Jack attempts a weak smile. Nancy slides into the cubicle
with Jack, closing the door. She crouches down on the
floor.
NANCY (CONT’D)
This is cosy.
Jack pulls some toilet roll off the roll and blows his nose
loudly like a proper old man. As he’s sitting on the
toilet, he has nowhere to put the dirty tissue. Nancy puts
her hand out, and he drops it into her palm.
NANCY (CONT’D)
(earnest)
Sorry. I’ve had a bad relationship
run over the last few years. It’s
made me... not the most positive
person. I over-analyse, come up
with elaborate theories, make
monumentally bad decisions JACK
I’ve just got to move on. She’s
out there, happy with someone
else, and I’m still holding on.
NANCY
Okay, A) I wouldn’t say ‘happy’.
And secondly, you’re not holding
on to her, you’re just holding on
to a feeling that will eventually
pass.
(she looks at Jack’s sad
face)
And maybe I was wrong, maybe
dating 24-year-olds is exactly
what you need right now.
JACK
You’ve changed your tune.

Unlike the older lady, they do

Nancy deftly turns Jack away from Ed and Hilary, who
continue their argument. Behind then all, Daniel starts to
lay out the equipment to do flaming sambuca shots. Liquor,
shot glasses and one of those long clipper lighters. He
starts to fill up the shot glasses.

hers, nearly pukes, and decides to throw it over her
shoulder. It lands straight in Ed’s eyes.

over dramatically)
Aaaargh! It burns! It burns!
Nancy and Jack turn around to see - Ed, flailing around,
unable to open his eyes. He leans forward on the bar, his

His sleeve is now on fire.

She turns to Daniel, drenching him. She turns away from a
furious Daniel, drenching the dancefloor. She turns to Jack,

EXT. QUEEN ELIZABETH HALL/SOUTH BANK - NIGHT
Jack and Jessica are finishing up their first drink.
JACK
Yup, I’ve got big home improvement

I can’t remember what I got for my

I can really. I’m not that old.

Two B’s and a C.

No, one B, two C’s.

remember)
I passed them all anyway.
JESSICA
(bit bewildered)
Well done.
(determined to be positive)
Anyway, I’m so glad you’re a fan of
6 Billion People and You as well.
And sorry I was late to meet you,
but actually the reason I had to
buy another copy was because I left
my copy for this woman on the
train. She so needed to read it.
As Jessica continues to talk, Jack suddenly perks up.
JESSICA (CONT’D)
She was a very unhappy soul, one of
those lost hope, clock ticking kind
of women As Jack takes this in... Jessica suddenly whips out a girly,
multi-coloured notepad from her bag.
JESSICA (CONT’D)
Anyway, let’s do the lists!
JACK
(disorientated)
The lists? Oh right, yeah He reaches into his bag, and suddenly smiles. Yes, there it
is - Nancy’s notepad. As Jessica starts to efficiently
flick her notepad over.

Jack takes a massive gulp of beer, flips over Nancy’s

SPEECH. He looks up at Jessica, who is offering her notepad over to him Ready?

JESSICA (CONT’D)

EXT. A WATERLOO STREET - NIGHT
An elated Jessica is trying to hail a cab, with a flustered
Jack by her side.
JACK
I’m so sorry about this JESSICA
What are you talking about? It’s
amazing! If I hadn’t left her the
book, oh my god... it’s like the
most epic love story ever (so triumphant)
- and it means I was right, and she
was wrong!

Taxi!
A taxi screeches to a halt. Jessica swings open the door,
gets Jack in. As she goes to the driver’s window JESSICA
(to Jack)
Where to?
As it suddenly dawns on Jack that he has no idea JACK
Shit. I have no idea.
JESSICA
Just call her JACK
I don’t have her number.

Don’t be ridiculous (getting her iPhone out)
Everyone is connected, you’ll have

grabs Jessica’s face, kisses her firmly on the cheek.
JACK
You bloody genius.

Keep up the triathleting!
INT. BLOOMSBURY BOWLING LANES - NIGHT
It’s quiet at the bowling alley now, and Sean is bowling on
his own. He is wearing Jack’s scarf around his neck. He
lovingly kisses the bowling ball he is holding, and is just
about to take a shot when JACK

Sean flings his bowling ball across three lanes.
EXT. A RUN DOWN OLD CAR - NIGHT
On the back, a bumper sticker that reads ‘GRASS, CASH OR ASS - NO-ONE RIDES FOR FREE’.
The car is burning some rubber through suburbia, the bright
lights of Central London behind it. Whose car could it be?
INT. SEAN’S CAR - NIGHT
It is of course, Sean’s car. And sat next to him is Jack,
holding on for dear life as Sean blatantly runs a red light.
As Sean dramatically swerves to dangerously over-take
someone.
JACK

I really don’t mind getting the

So what’s your plan?
My plan?

SEAN
To win her heart?
JACK
This isn’t a power ballad SEAN
Well it should be. Grand, romantic

Declarations. Heart on the line.
Life changing kind of stuff. That’s
what I was going for in the toilets

As Sean takes a sharp left hand turn, using just his left
hand, Jack looks aghast, visibly blanching.

Jack is visibly appalled. Sean overtakes another car, putting
his foot down on the accelerator. Screeeeeeeeech INT. SEAN’S CAR - NIGHT
Sean takes an abrupt sharp left hand turn onto a quiet,
street lamp lit row of Victorian terrace houses. He brings
the car to a halt, looks around.
JACK

Are we here?
SEAN
(tapping the wheel)
Yup. We’re here.
JACK
What number?

74.

SEAN

conviction)

Sean revs the engine.

Jack gets out. Sean speeds off down the road. Jack looks at
the houses. Take a deep breath. Heads for number 74.
INT. NANCY’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
Nancy, still sobbing, surrounded by Elaine, Adam, Bert and
Fran. They are trying to work out what she is saying, but she
is practically indecipherable throughout this scene NANCY

ESSIE
Old Man Stripper Gram!
JACK
(panic)
What, no As Essie and Sophie pull Jack into the house - a house that
does not appear to be Nancy’s parents' house, and does not
feel like a 40th Wedding Anniversary Party. Instead, it’s a
total teenage free house party, and it’s in full swing.

into the house. Sean grins at her, slamming the door shut on
us. And we see that the house number is not 74, it’s number
47.
INT. HOUSE NUMBER 74 - NIGHT
Jack is now at the very the epicentre of the teenage party the kitchen. Shots being done at the breakfast bar, joints
being lit and one couple getting off with each other up
against the fridge, which one of the teenagers needs to get
into for more booze. Essie and Sophie have their arms around
Jack as they lead him through the carnage ESSIE

Everybody, this is Jack!

A group of teenagers are doing rainbow body shots. They all
look at him in unison.

holding her hair back for her JACK
None of you are Nancy! Nancy

JACK
Can you take me to her?
Yes I can!

HARRY

Huge cheers, as the whole party follows Jack outside MUSIC UP - ‘HERE I GO AGAIN’ by Whitesnake.
We go out into the street with Jack, Harry and the teenagers.
Harry points up the road. Jack starts running up the middle
of the road, the teenagers immediately following him.
They’re a jogging/on a mission/take no prisoners sight to
behold. As Jack intently focuses on the mission ahead - Nancy, with a very large glass of wine and Sean - sitting
in the chair Bert got earlier - now at the party. Nancy’s
beaming family and friends look on. The only thing Nancy can
do is... attempt a pathetically sad smile back. Everyone
around her is happily chatting now, onto their puddings...
Sean looks like the cat who’s got the cream - or rather, the
chocolate mousse. As he takes a spoon, and tries to start
feeding Nancy some - Jack and the teenagers, still running up the middle of the
road. They are a force to reckon with. Various bemused
reactions from people walking past, and a couple of
disapproving neighbours looking out of their windows. But
Jack is still focused, and the teenagers are loving every
minute of it.
- Sean, trying to force-feed a very depressed Nancy some
chocolate mousse. She is trying to keep her mouth shut, but
Sean is determined - Jack and the teenagers still running. Wider shots of them
running round corners and junctions. Their journey isn't
quite as linear as we first thought, and there is growing
confusion/frustration from Jack. He looks to Harry - wtf? and Harry starts to doubt he knows exactly where he's going.
Wide portrait shot of Jack leading the teenagers through
frame at a T-junction. They exit frame and then run back,
around the junction towards camera. Jack glares at Harry.
This boy really isn't helping.
- back to Nancy, and Sean is still trying to get his
chocolate mousse spoon into her mouth. Sean discards the
spoon suddenly - Nancy looks at him, fearful of his next
move, as we hard cut back to -

MAN UP - Tess Morris

- Jack and his teenagers, all gathered around an iPhone in
the middle of a crossroads - Jack is very frustrated with his
teenage charges. Very blank confused looks from them all.
Jack - ‘you have no idea where we are, do you?’. Errr no they have no idea where the house is or where we are now!
Sicky girl throws up in the background. (She shouldn't have
come, really).
Jack looks around in desperation. He turns and starts
sprinting, the teenagers following - they won’t desert him!
- jump cut out to an ever widening top shot to see the whole
of a suburban grid of roads and houses, and Jack and his
hapless group snaking up a road. Their task looks truly
helpless...
- Nancy and Sean, the chocolate mousse action has really
ramped up now, and Sean is now using his finger. The guests
have started to notice. Hard cut back to - Jack, running down a narrow alley between houses, teenagers
still behind, trying to keep up. Jack is desperate - trying
to look over tops of walls, fences - ‘Where is this house!’ he reaches the end of the alley - desperately looking around he suddenly spots Sean's car in distance.
His confusion doesn’t take long to turn to fury, as he
realises Sean has tricked him - and that the house where his
car is parked is Nancy's parents' house.
As Jack dashes the final 100 yards towards the car, and more
importantly Nancy's parents’ house, with the teenagers
scrambling to keep up with him.
INT. NANCY’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
- Sean has succeeded in getting his finger into Nancy’s
mouth(!) and has smeared chocolate mousse all over it. She is
just letting him do it now, staring into space. The sound of
Bert, clinking his glass BERT
Ladies and gentlemen, your
attention please?
Everyone quietens down as. Bert moves to stand next to Fran,
who is sitting down - he tops up her wine glass in readiness
for the toast - and they both look at Nancy expectantly.
Nancy - oh my god, shit, yes - she wipes the chocolate mousse
from her mouth. Attempts to reset. Elaine sits up, excited.
Nancy rises slowly from her chair.
NANCY

words.

Hello!

I was standing underneath the clock
at Waterloo, this afternoon, when a
man called Jack mistook me for his
blind date. And instead of saying
‘you’ve got the wrong girl’, like a
normal person, for some reason I
decided it would be a good idea to
pretend I was his date.
Elaine - sharp intake of breath - oh my god Nancy you didn’t!
Nancy - yes I did.
NANCY (CONT’D)
So we went out, and for the first
time in ages I put myself out
there, I took a chance, I even got
stronger thighs Everyone is a bit confused now. But Elaine smiles.

Don’t be sad! I’m not sad! I mean,
I am sad, but I’m also quite proud

me to take a chance on her too. But
I didn’t. I blew it, like the 40year-old mid life crisis dickhead I
am. Which is why I have sought
help from ‘old beaus’ (he looks over at Sean)
- admittedly not the most reliable
source, but still Sean holds up his hands - all’s fair in love and war.
JACK
- and ended up at a teenage house
party instead! But I commandeered
those crazy, drunken youths and
together we went on a journey,
through the mean streets of
suburban London, because nothing
was going to stop me from finding
this girl again, and telling her
what I should have just told her
earlier...

Nancy. I am so bloody glad you
pretended to be my blind date
today. Because if you hadn’t, then
I never would have heard all your
amazing sex theories, or watch you
try to get jalapeno out of your
teeth, or witnessed your
instinctive firewoman skills, your
tactical vomit. I would never have
got to know your muddy beautiful,

surprisingly dirty laugh, or watch
your awesome, competitive arse when

If you hadn’t pretended to be my

been utterly rubbish...

back. Jack and Nancy start to kiss. Everyone cheers. The
party is back on.
NANCY

Jack does as he’s told. They grin at each other, kissing

slightly crazy teenagers now all dancing on the front lawn,

Things start to heat up, and we move out of the hot and
steamy bathroom, into the corridor, where Sean has his ear
pressed to the door, straining to hear what is going on in
there. He is finally rewarded as he overhears NANCY (O.S.)
Sweet baby Jesus.
Sean, triumphant and grinning from ear to ear to have heard
this, sniffing the scarf he thinks is Nancy’s. The camera
tracks through the house now, along the hallway and into the
main party scene, where we see happy vignettes of everyone
dancing, celebrating, having fun: Elaine and Adam, Bert and
Fran, all our crazy teenagers.
The camera backs away through all the guests, wiping into a
crane shot that pulls through the open window Jack has just
climbed through. And now we’re outside the house, pulling
away all the time, as we pull up and away into the night sky,
because guess what? Yes, it’s...
