INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
Concealer, lipstick, mascara on the counter. RUTH BADER
GINSBURG (36) is applying blush. When she’s finished, she
considers her reflection. She puts on A GOLD, SUNBURST PIN.
And tries a smile. ..... But it looks forced. She drops it.
A breath. And she tries again. A different smile. And...
RUTH
May it please the court.
Not right yet. A smile. And...
RUTH (CONT’D)
Your honors and may it please the
court...
That’s not it either...
RUTH (CONT’D)
May it please the court.
She looks herself in the eye one more time.
CUT TO:
MAIN TITLE -- OVER BLACK:

ON THE BASIS OF SEX
HEAR: Driving, martial music. Horns and drums. It’s the
Crimson fight song “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.”
AS A MALE CHORUS joins...
EXT. AUSTIN HALL - DAY
Well groomed white MEN (20s) march through a quad. Into an
impressive building with columned arches.
“Ten Thousand Men of Harvard want victory today....”
They’re the future leaders of America. And in their well-cut
dark suits, with their cocky grins, it’s clear they know it.
“For they know that o’er old Eli, fair Harvard holds sway...”
But amidst the pants and loafers -- GLIMPSE: a pair of highheeled shoes, a skirt swaying, shoulder-length brown hair.
“So then we’ll conquer all old Eli’s men...”

2

INT. AUSTIN HALL - DAY
AS THEY ENTER AN AUDITORIUM: She slows her step. Letting the
men pass...
IT’S RUTH (23 here). Petite, lean and striking. She takes in
the size of the place, its grandeur. And is awed.
“And when the game ends, we’ll sing again...”
Proud, she continues down the center aisle.
“Ten thousand men of Harvard gained victory today!”
Ruth finds a seat. And as the crowd quiets, smiles to the man
she’s settling beside. He stares. Confused by her presence.
IN FRONT: A line of seated professors. AMONG THEM: Professor
Ernest Brown. ERWIN GRISWOLD (52, formidable) comes to a
podium:
GRISWOLD
Settle down, please. ... Be seated.
SUPER: 1956
GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
My name is Erwin Griswold. I’m the
dean of this place. ... Welcome to
Harvard Law School. We have no glee
club here. The work is hard. The
load is heavy. ... Take a moment to
look around you...
Ruth does. There are over five hundred people in this grand
room. Most of them are white. Only nine of them are women.
GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
In this room are Rhodes and
Fulbright scholars. Phi Beta Kappa
members. Student body presidents. A
Harvard Crimson football captain.
Pats on the back for the smiling sports hero.
GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
Together, you will become lawyers.
It is a privilege you share. And a
responsibility that you accept. ...
Consider: what does it mean to be a
Harvard man? A Harvard man is
intelligent, of course. But he is
also tenacious. He is a leader
devoted to the rule of law.

GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
He is mindful of his country. Loyal
to tradition. And he is respectful
and protective of our institutions.
OFF RUTH: Determined.
INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - LATE DAY
The garden apartment is small and uncluttered: mismatched
furniture, books, baby toys and museum posters.
IN THE BEDROOM: THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO plays on a record.
Ruth, in a slip, is considering the contents of her closet.
One dress in hand, she pulls out another. She can’t decide.
She takes them with her... Out of the room. DOWN THE HALL...
THE LIVING ROOM empty, she enters THE ADJACENT KITCHEN:
RUTH
(re: the dresses)
Which one makes me look more like a
Harvard man?
MARTIN GINSBURG (24, classically handsome) is at the kitchen
table. Bouncing their daughter JANE (1) on his knee.
He looks up from a textbook before him. Adoring.
MARTIN
I’m thrilled you look nothing like
a Harvard man.
RUTH
Seriously, you know how I am at
these things. It’s the dean’s
dinner, Marty. I need to make a
good impression.
MARTIN
You will, Kiki (pr: Kick-EE). But
it’s the other way around. You make
the dress look good.
She kisses him -- and Jane. Then notices Martin’s untouched
plate of “food” on the table.
RUTH
You barely touched your tuna
casserole. I put onions in. They
help, right?
They don’t. As he forces down a forkful:
(CONTINUED)

4

MARTIN
Yeah... Definitely.
RUTH
(re: the dresses)
I don’t like either of these.
She breezes out of the room.
MARTIN
(to Jane)
So. Where were we? ... Ah.
(reading aloud to her)
The Tax Code disallows some
deductions held to be contrary to
the public interest.
(off Jane’s babbling)
Just wait. This is the good part.
He eats a grape off her plate.
OMITTED
INT. HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB - FOYER - NIGHT
A grand room. Dignified and formal. MALE PROFESSORS in suits
chatting collegially. THE EIGHT OTHER WOMEN of the class of
1959 (20s, intelligent, poised) are ingratiating themselves.
Ruth enters. A vision in her swing dress and pearls. And
takes it all in: The room. The crowd. The chatter... The men
are proffering arms to the women. Forming a double-line to
enter THE DINING ROOM...
Before the doors, Dean Griswold and his wife, HARRIET
GRISWOLD (52, on crutches, crippled by polio), are welcoming
their guests...
HARRIET GRISWOLD
Welcome. ... Hello, Professor.
GRISWOLD
Harry. You’re happy with the
updated textbooks? ... Good.
Ruth prepares herself... Then joins in.

5

INT. HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB - DINING ROOM - LATER
Ruth eats her stewed chicken and lima beans with slow
precision.
She scans the room. They’re around a formal dining table: men
and women in alternating seats. Entrenched in conversation.
Being served by Black Waiters.
She eyes the women: Confident. Wise. With easy laughs.
To her right: a YOUNG PROFESSOR faces away from her, ashing a
cigarette in the ashtray between him and Ruth, and talking up
one of the women, EMILY:
YOUNG PROFESSOR
He said, “Professor, have you
corrected our papers?” I said,
“Correcting them would take a
lifetime. I’m merely grading them.”
Emily laughs gregariously.
DING-DING-DING. At the head of the table, Griswold TAPS HIS
GLASS, rising. Ruth puts down her utensils neatly.
GRISWOLD
Esteemed colleagues. Ladies. This
is only the sixth year women have
had the privilege to earn a Harvard
Law degree. This little soiree is
our way of saying welcome.
(pointing her out)
My wife Harriet and I are glad all
nine of you have joined us.
APPLAUSE. Ruth is grateful. But notes that some professors
are more enthusiastic than others.
GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
Let us go around the table. And
each of the ladies, report who you
are, where you’re from... And why
you’re occupying a place at Harvard
that could have gone to a man.
As Griswold sits, Ruth is disquieted. She and the other women
exchange anxious glances. Harriet singles out the closest:
HARRIET GRISWOLD
Why don’t you get us started, dear?
One of Ruth’s CLASSMATES rises. White knuckling her chair:

(CONTINUED)

6

CLASSMATE
I’m Hennie Callaghan. Father’s a
lawyer back in Minneapolis. He used
to give me drafts of contracts to
use for drawing paper. At some
point, I got more interested in
reading them than drawing on them.
In a few years, it’s going to be
Callaghan and Callaghan.
GRISWOLD
That was fine. Next?
EMILY’s turn. She rises.
EMILY
Emily Hicks. Hello. Connecticut.
When I finished Mt. Holyoke, my
mother wanted me to get married.
But I didn’t want to do THAT. And I
didn’t want to be a teacher or a
nurse. So when I-GRISWOLD
Ha. That’s not a very good reason.
Ruth watches Emily slump into her seat -- mortified. All eyes
land on Ruth. Including Griswold’s. She stands...
And knocks over the Young Professor’s ash tray. It lands with
a heavy thud. Ruth stares at the ash and butts on the rug...
When she looks up -- she eyes them all. The anxious women.
The men watching her. Emily controlling her frustration.
Griswold is waiting...
RUTH
I’m Ruth Ginsburg, from Brooklyn.
GRISWOLD
And why are you here Miss Ginsburg?
RUTH
Mrs. Ginsburg, actually. My husband
Marty is in the second-year class.
..... I’m at Harvard to learn about
his work. So I can be a more
patient and understanding wife.
Emily laughs. Several others gasp. And on Griswold’s face is
plain dislike.
OFF RUTH: Seeing it.

7

INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Ruth. Home from dinner. Rubbing her sore feet.
RUTH
Come to dinner. The beans will be
boiled. The chicken will be stewed.
And you will be grilled. ... We
came to Harvard to be lawyers. Why
else?
Martin, in an undershirt, climbs off the bed.
MARTIN
It was an asinine question.
RUTH
I couldn’t just ignore it! But the
way he looked at me. Now he’ll
never take me seriously.
MARTIN
You’re smarter than everyone here.
You’ll be better prepared. Just
stand up and say what you know. In
this place, that’s all the matters.
She turns her back: Unzip me.
RUTH
In my experience even small
mistakes are glaring when you stick
out.
The dress falls to the floor. And he turns her around...
MARTIN
Then you’re lucky. Because you’re
very short.
She laughs. Despite herself.
RUTH
Oh, yeah? Why don’t you come down
here and say that to my face?
She pulls him into a kiss. Flirty. Fun... He lifts her. She
buries her face in his neck, as they fall onto the bed.
INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
The grand room is laid out like a Roman theater. Portraits of
alumni stare down: Holmes, Brandeis, Frankfurter...
(CONTINUED)

8

Ruth sits in the first row. Surrounded by men. A textbook on
the desk: Introduction to Contracts.
At nine-thirty precisely, PROF. ERNEST BROWN (50) enters. And
begins lecturing.
BROWN
I’m Professor Brown. This is
Introduction to Contracts. Hawkins
versus McGee.
Ruth’s hand flies up. Along with several others. Brown eyes
one student not raising his hand -- and finds him on a huge
seating chart with passport-size photos...
BROWN (CONT’D)
State the case please, Mr. Pruitt.
PRUITT adjusts his tie as he rises.
PRUITT
Uh, good morning. I’m Donald
Pruitt. I’m really honored to be
here with-BROWN
Hawkins v McGee.
As Pruitt flips through his textbook:
PRUITT
Hawkins v McGee. It’s uh-- a
fascinating breach-of-contract case
that-(found it)
Oh, right! Charles Hawkins hurt his
hand. And McGee-BROWN
Can someone help him, please?
As Pruitt deflates into his seat, a smug classmate,
FITZPATRICK, sees Ruth’s hand go up first. He raises his as
well. Brown looks at Ruth. Checks his seating chart...
BROWN (CONT’D)
Yes? ... Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Fitzpatrick rises, giving Ruth a look...
FITZPATRICK
It was Charles’s son who hurt his
hand. ... Electrocution burn.

(CONTINUED)

9

BROWN
And on what point does the case
turn, Mr. Fitzpatrick?
FITZPATRICK
McGee promised to fix the hand...
Ruth frowns. She knows Fitzpatrick’s not quite right. But
notices that no one else seems bothered by it.
FITZPATRICK (CONT’D)
...by performing a skin graft. But
McGee wasn’t very familiar with the
procedure. And the results weren’t
quite what he’d planned.
Ruth can’t let it lie. She decides to raise her hand.
BROWN
A question already, Mrs. Ginsburg?
RUTH
(rising)
A correction, Professor Brown.
McGee did not simply promise to fix
George Hawkins’s hand. He promised,
quote: a one hundred-percent good
hand.
Pruitt flips pages in his textbook, trying to catch up.
FITZPATRICK
That’s the same thing.
BROWN
Is it? What say you, Mrs. Ginsburg?
RUTH
It is not. Words matter. McGee
grafted skin from Hawkins’s chest.
Not only did this fail to fix the
scarring, he had chest hair growing
on his palm.
FITZPATRICK
Proving that a hand with a burn is
worth two with a bush.
LAUGHTER FROM THE CLASS.
RUTH
The Court denied Hawkins damages--

(CONTINUED)

10

FITZPATRICK
Hawkins did get damages! The court
said he could keep up to five
hundred dollars-RUTH
If I may finish: Hawkins was denied
damages for pain and suffering.
(as Fitzpatrick sits)
The New Hampshire Supreme Court
ruled he was entitled to damages
only based on the expected result
of the contract being fulfilled.
Brown, sliding down his reading glasses, measures up Ruth
over the frames. Pruitt, still flipping pages, is frantic.
RUTH (CONT’D)
So if Dr. McGee had set realistic
expectations, instead of making
grand promises, Hawkins’s award
likely would have been less.
A pair of men share a glance: “Ball-buster.” Pruitt gives up.
Ruth has silenced the room.
BROWN
Was that an answer, Mrs. Ginsburg,
or a filibuster?
As the class laughs, Ruth sits. Holding steady.
INT. HARVARD STUDENT UNION - DAY
Couches and endless book shelves. Warm light through the
windows. Students study, read, and hang out. AND IN ONE NOOK:
Emily is on a couch with another female FRIEND (20s). Martin
and TWO OTHER GUYS (20s) are on another. Beers all around.
Ruth stands before them... THEY’RE PLAYING CHARADES:
EMILY & FRIEND
Movie... Four words... Second word.
Ruth takes a swig of her beer. Then holds up seven fingers.
Seven.

FRIEND

EMILY & FRIEND
Fourth word.
Ruth thinks a beat... then starts scratching. The Men LAUGH.
(CONTINUED)

11

EMILY
Ape! Gorilla!
Monkey!

FRIEND

EMILY
Monkey Business!
Ruth waves them off. Builds her courage -- despite the
passing gawkers... And does her best Marilyn Monroe. Posing.
Back arched. Butt out.
FRIEND
Monkey on my back!
THE MEN LAUGH MORE. Martin laughs so hard his stomach hurts.
As Ruth reminds them: Second word. Seven.
EMILY
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
FRIEND
What’s that have to do with
monkeys?
GUY 1
(eye on his watch)
Annnnnd....
EMILY
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Time!

GUY 1

Yes!

EMILY (CONT'D)
The Seven Year Itch!
RUTH

As Martin gets up and kisses her:
MARTIN
Ruthless Ruthy strikes again!
She jabs him in the gut playfully with an elbow.
GUY 1
Okay. Next round is riding on you.
As Martin picks his clue from a hat:
RUTH
Don’t worry. He’s very good.

(CONTINUED)

12

MARTIN
And she dumped a guy once for being
bad at charades.
FRIEND
You didn’t really?
RUTH
It was a manifestation... of his
being an idiot.
EMILY
(to Guy 2)
Don’t worry. I’m comfortable being
smarter than you.
GUY 2
Oh, thank you.
LAUGHTER ALL AROUND.
FRIEND
Everyone ready? And... Go!
Martin begins.
A song.

GUYS 1 & 2

Martin curls his lip, shakes his arms, and gyrates his hips.
They enjoy his spot-on impression -- especially Ruth.
By Elvis.

GUY 1

GUYS 1 & 2
Three words. ... First word.
He points to a blue pillow:
GUY 1
Pillow! Chair!
GUY 2
Blue! Blueberry Hill!
GUY 1
That’s Fats Domino.
GUY 2
Third word.
Pointing to his feet, Martin does a bit of fancy footwork...

(CONTINUED)

13

FRIEND
Nice moves!
Martin winces, clutching his belly. And cries out.
EMILY
No sound effects!

GUY 1
Blue Suede Shoes!

MARTIN BUCKLES -- AS HE FALLS TO THE FLOOR:
GUY 2
Marty, you’re a lightweight.
Ruth knows something’s wrong. She runs to Martin. Going to
her knees. Cradling him...
RUTH
Marty? ... Marty!
Martin’s looking up at her. Pain written on his face.
RUTH (CONT’D)
He needs help. Somebody help!
As Ruth’s world slows and the sound fades:
GUY 1
Someone call an ambulance!
RUTH
Marty. I’m right here. I have you.
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
Hard floors and harder chairs. Ruth sits alone...
TIME CUTS:
It’s crowded. Ruth tries not to watch the other
worrying families. A man soothes his wife...
Fewer people waiting. Ruth still waiting. A mother reprimands
her son in harsh whispers...
Fewer still. Ruth still waiting. The misbehaving boy is
asleep on his mother’s lap...
The sky is lightening out the window. The few people left are
sleeping. Except Ruth. Still up. Still waiting.
She gets up...

14

INT. NURSES’ STATION / CORRIDOR - EARLY MORNING
Ruth approaches and tries to get the attention of TWO NURSES - talking among themselves:
RUTH
Excuse me. Excuse me? I’d like to
see the doctor who-One gestures for her to wait.
She does for a frustrated beat. Then notices AN EMERGENCY
ROOM DOCTOR (30) DOWN THE HALL. Ruth pursues him...
RUTH (CONT’D)
Doctor? ... Doctor?
He turns with a look that says, “I don’t have time for this.”
Yes?

EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR

RUTH
You examined my husband. I’m
wondering when you think he’ll be
able to leave. I need to call the
sitter.
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR
What’s the patient’s name?
RUTH
Ginsburg. Martin.
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR
Right. Ginsburg... He’s not going
home tonight.
Excuse me?

RUTH

EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR
We have more tests to run.
RUTH
What kind of tests?
Her voice stops him in his tracks.
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR
Various kinds. He’s gonna be with
us a while.

(CONTINUED)

15

RUTH
What tests are you running on my
husband?
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR
There was a shadow on his X-ray
that-RUTH
What kind of shadow?! I need to see
him!
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR
Mrs. Ginsburg. You’re getting
yourself worked up. Go home. Get
some rest. We’ll know more in a few
days. ..... If you’ll excuse me.
He leaves her. In the busy hallway. Uncertain and scared...
INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - MORNING
Ruth enters. The sound of the door wakes up Emily, on the
couch. Still in the same dress as during charades.
RUTH
Thank you so much.
EMILY
Ruth. Of course. Jane was a doll.
She’s blissfully asleep. .... How
is he?
RUTH
Fine. I’m sure he’ll be fine.
Emily hesitates to believe her. Then gives her a long hug.
EMILY
Call any time. Okay?
She leaves Ruth. ... Alone. And painfully aware of it.
Ruth turns on the record player, lifts the needle. AND STOPS.
Her gaze shifts to the collection of FAMILY PHOTOS on the
credenza beside the record player. TO HER MOTHER. Posing with
young Ruth. Supportive. Uncompromising. Strong. Wearing the
same sunburst pin Ruth wore in the opening scene.
Ruth lowers the needle at last. Static gives way to SOFT
OPERA. A breath. Then Ruth walks DOWN THE EMPTY HALL...

(CONTINUED)

16

TO JANE’S BEDROOM. As the girl sleeps, Ruth watches her.
Keeping her fear and doubt at bay.
ENTERING HER AND MARTIN’S BEDROOM, she collapses atop the
covers. And curls up alone...
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - DAYS LATER
Bright. Antiseptic. A TICKING CLOCK. Martin is hooked up to a
glass IV. Reading a textbook in bed. In a chair beside him,
Ruth has a law book as well. But she’s watching him. Waiting.
Her gaze shifts -- to an empty hospital food tray...
RUTH
At least you got a break from my
cooking.
He looks to her. And they laugh -- nervously.
DOCTOR WYLAND LEADBETTER (50) enters. Clean-shaven, in a bowtie, vest and white coat, full of genial self-confidence.
DR. LEADBETTER
Good afternoon.
RUTH
Dr. Leadbetter.
Hey, Doc.

MARTIN

As he pulls up a chair, he glances at Martin’s textbook:
DR. LEADBETTER
Fundamental Principles of Corporate
Taxation: Addressing the Challenges
of Today’s Regulatory Environment.
I thought medical books were dry.
He sits. And prepares himself to deliver the news...
DR. LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
It’s as we feared.
Ruth and Martin take the blow.
DR. LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
Marty you’re young, and we caught
it early. We’ve pioneered a
treatment here.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

17

DR. LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
It entails multiple surgeries, each
followed by a course of radiation.
It’s-- well, it’s unpleasant, but-MARTIN
What does that mean?
RUTH
On top of the pain of surgery, the
radiation will leave you exhausted,
nauseous. Prone to infection.
MARTIN
(off Leadbetter’s look)
Her mother died of cervical cancer.
DR. LEADBETTER
With the new treatment, there’s a
chance you could go on to live a
healthy, normal life -- as if this
never happened.
RUTH
What kind of “a chance”?
(off his hesitation)
Dr. Leadbetter, we’d rather know
what we’re facing.
DR. LEADBETTER
The survival rate for testicular
cancer has been about five percent.
It hangs there for a beat...
MARTIN
Thank you for the honesty. I think.
DR. LEADBETTER
(leaving)
I’ll let you two talk.
In the wreckage of his wake: a heavy silence...
Martin tries to make sense of it. Ruth stifles her tears.
They can’t even look at each other...
Until Ruth takes Martin’s hand. Pulling him back into the
present. They watch one another a beat...
She rises. And sits on the bed beside him. Their eyes locked.
I’m sorry.

MARTIN

(CONTINUED)

18

Slowly she lies next to him. They hold each other. Watching
one another. The clear path of their future lost in a haze...
RUTH
We’re never giving up. Keep
working. Keep studying. Jane will
have her father. And you will be a
lawyer. I am spending my life with
you, Martin Ginsburg.
EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - DAY
Bare trees. Snow flurries. ... Ruth rushes through. She’s
running late.
FREUND (V.O.)
Judicial consistency...
INT. LECTURE HALL TWO - DAY
PROFESSOR FREUND (48), black hair, broad, lectures before a
full class. His voice resonant:
FREUND
The doctrine of stare decisis comes
from English Common Law...
The door CREAKS. And Ruth enters. As Freund continues
lecturing, he watches her find a seat in back.
FREUND (CONT’D)
Which also provides the first
examples of circumstances where
precedents may be overturned.
Judges are bound... Excuse me. May
I help you?
She rises tentatively.
RUTH
I’m Martin Ginsburg’s wife. I’ll be
attending his classes for him.
Freund seems surprised by it. His students are impressed.
FREUND
In addition to your own?
The look in her eye leaves no room for negotiation. Freund is
moved. He resumes his lecture without further objection...

(CONTINUED)

19

FREUND (CONT’D)
Judges are bound by precedent. But
cannot ignore cultural change.
Ruth sits and begins taking notes.
FREUND (CONT’D)
A Court ought not be affected by
the weather of the day, but will be
by the climate of the era.
MARTIN (V.O.)
(weakly)
Wait. Wait. Say that again...
INT. GINSBURG HARVARD APARTMENT - NIGHT
AT THE KITCHEN TABLE: Ruth sits before a typewriter. From her
vantage point, through the opening between rooms, she can
only see half of Martin -- LYING ON THE LIVING ROOM COUCH.
RUTH
(reading her notes aloud)
A Court ought not be affected by
the weather of the day, but will be
by the climate of the era.
MARTIN
You’re sure that’s what he said?
She leans to the side to give him a look that says “Are you
kidding?” His chalky skin is blotched in sweat.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
(off her look)
Of course.
He closes his eyes and catches his breath.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
The law is never finished. It is a
work in progress. And ever will be.
As he dictates, Ruth types...
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Brown v Board of Education,
parenthesis 1954, was the most
revolutionary Supreme Court case of
the last century...
WAAAAH! Somewhere in the apartment, JANE CRIES. Ruth types
the last few letters as she rises...
(CONTINUED)

20

Martin continues, AS SHE PASSES HIM:
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Representing Oliver Brown, et. al.
RUTH
I’m not listening.
SHE HEADS FOR JANE’S ROOM, but Martin’s on a roll:
MARTIN (O.S.)
Thurgood Marshall educated the
Court about the burdens created by
segregation-IN JANE’S ROOM, the crying drowns Martin out.
RUTH
Sweetheart. What’s wrong?
Ruth scoops her up. And her cries fade to a whimper. Ruth
takes Jane with her back to THE LIVING ROOM... en route to
THE KITCHEN:
RUTH (CONT’D)
Okay. Brown v. Board of Ed. Go.
Silence. It stops her. Clutching Jane, she turns to find
Martin still as stone. She approaches him...
Martin’s asleep. His breathing shallow. Jane still in her
arms, Ruth returns to THE KITCHEN.
She takes a sip of coffee. Then removes the page from the
typewriter, stacks it with others, and puts them all into a
folder -- labelled “Martin.”
She opens another folder: “Ruth.” Loads a half-typed page
into the machine. And resumes her work in the quiet dark....
RUTH (V.O.)
One... Two...
EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - AUSTIN HALL - DAY - 18 MONTHS LATER 16
Campus is in bloom. Ruth and Martin walk with Jane (3 now)
holding both their hands and swinging between them....
RUTH
...Threeeeee!
JANE
Again! Again!
(CONTINUED)

21

RUTH
(reading Martin’s look)
Daddy needs a rest, sweetheart.
JANE
(disappointed)
Okay.
When she runs ahead, Martin watches her.
MARTIN
One day that little angel is going
to slam a door in our faces and
tell us we’re ruining her life.
Ruth appreciates the observation.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
I shouldn’t have taken the job.
RUTH
It’s a great firm. And New York is
the center of the legal universe.
You’ve earned it.
MARTIN
You earned it. I just survived. I
don’t want be apart from either of
you.
RUTH
You won’t be. I won’t allow it. ...
I’ll convince him.
INT. DEAN GRISWOLD’S OFFICE - DAY
A room with history. Daunting. Regal. Griswold sits at his
desk. Ruth, tiny in an oversized chair, looks him in the eye.
GRISWOLD
You want a Harvard degree, though
you plan to finish your coursework
at... Columbia? You would be well
served to remember, Mrs. Ginsburg,
how fortunate you are to be here.
RUTH
Dean Griswold, between the first
and third year of law school, which
is the more substantive? The more
critical?

(CONTINUED)

22

GRISWOLD
The first. Of course.
RUTH
Yet when someone transfers in as a
second-year student -- having taken
those more important classes
elsewhere -- he’s allowed a degree.
That’s--

GRISWOLD

RUTH
I’ve been here two years. I’m first
in my class.
GRISWOLD
There is no reason why your husband
cannot provide for you while you
and the child remain in Boston.
RUTH
Last year, John Sumner was allowed
to finish his coursework in
Baltimore. Three years ago, Roy
Paxton-GRISWOLD
Very different cases.
RUTH
How are they differ-GRISWOLD
Mrs. Ginsburg. You have no
compelling need to transfer.
RUTH
Marty could relapse! The doctors
say at any time. He puts a good
face on it, but I can see it. He’s
scared. Dean Griswold, this is my
family.
Griswold is sympathetic for a beat...
GRISWOLD
Nonetheless. We each have our
responsibilities. And mine is to
protect the distinction of a
Harvard degree. I can’t force you
to stay. But I won’t reward you for
leaving, either.
OFF RUTH: The argument lost.

23

EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - AUSTIN HALL - LATER
Ruth. Bearing her disappointment. Comes out of the building.
For a beat, she watches Martin and Jane playing tag among the
trees. Until Martin stops to catch his breath. And notices
her. Smiling, he waves.
Ruth forces a smile. And waves back.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. GINSBURG APARTMENT (1959) - DAY
A brownstone on a quiet side street. Ruth comes out in smart
suit. Determined and bold.
She heads down the street. And around the corner. REVEALING:
NEW YORK, NY -- in autumnal red and gold. Vibrant, bustling,
and alive.
SUPER: 1959
E/I. MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Ruth goes through a revolving door into an impressive LOBBY.
She enters an elevator full of men in suits.
GREENE (V.O.)
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
INT. GREENE’S OFFICE - DAY
GREENE (45), a big man, a street-wise lawyer, is reading
Ruth’s resume. SOUNDS OF CONSTRUCTION outside.
GREENE
Graduating top of your class. Law
Review at Harvard AND COLUMBIA?! I
didn’t even know that was possible.
RUTH
Thank you, Mr. Greene. I’ve worked
hard.
GREENE
You want some white-shoe firm. Bigmoney cases, complex legal
maneuvers.
(CONTINUED)

24

RUTH
No, I think Bibler and Greene would
be a perfect fit. You handled the
Mercer bankruptcy last year, and-GREENE
C’mon. How many have you been to?
With a look, she deflects.
GREENE (CONT’D)
They all turned you down right? How
many? Ten?
Twelve.

RUTH

GREENE
A woman. A mother. A Jew, to boot.
I’m impressed that many let you
through the door.
RUTH
One sent me to interview for the
Secretarial Pool.
Ha!

GREENE

RUTH
Another told me I’d be too busy at
bake sales to be effective. One
partner closes clients in the
locker room at his club -- so he
said I’d be out of the loop. Last
week I was told women are too
emotional to be lawyers. Then, that
same afternoon, that a woman
graduating top of her class must be
“a real ball-buster,” and wouldn’t
make a good colleague. I was asked
when I’d have my next baby, and
whether I keep Shabbat. One
interviewer told me I have a
sterling resume, but they hired a
woman last year, and what in the
world would they want with two of
us?
Unburdened, she lets out her breath. And grows embarrassed.
Greene’s sardonic chuckle says he gets it:
GREENE
You must be livid.
(CONTINUED)

25

She is.
RUTH
My mother taught me not to give way
to emotions.
GREENE
Bull shit! You’re angry. Good! Use
it. I have to say, Mrs. Ginsburg,
I’m impressed.
A glimmer of hope. Ruth grabs for it...
RUTH
Mr. Greene. I want to be a lawyer.
I want to represent clients before
the court in pursuit of justice.
(re: her resume)
You can see I worked hard through
school. I did everything I was
supposed to, and I excelled. I
swear it: I’ll do the same for you.
Greene takes a moment to think... As he does, his gaze drifts
over the contours of her body. Ruth tenses.
GREENE
Thing is... We’re a close-knit
firm. Almost like family. And well-the wives, they get jealous.
Ruth stares him down. Fighting her building fury.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY
Ruth back on the street. Stunned...
She slows. Almost to a stop. Diminished...
New York continues its perpetual movement around her without
notice.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT (1959) - LIVING ROOM - DAY
It’s mostly the same furniture, art and books -- moved to a
new city. One addition: an original opera poster from Rome.
Ruth is on the couch with Jane (4 now) in her lap. They’re
reading the Marcia Brown illustrated edition of CINDERELLA...

(CONTINUED)

26

RUTH
The prince would marry her whose
foot would fit the little slipper.
First they tried it on the-They hear the FRONT DOOR OPEN. As Martin finds them:
MARTIN (O.S.)
Ruth? Kiki?
Daddy!

JANE

MARTIN
(sweeping her up)
Hi sweetie.
He notes a bottle of champagne on ice near the couch.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
You got the job! Are they giving
you a corner office, or will they
make you jump through hoops first?
He kisses her.
RUTH
It’s not at Bibler and Greene. I
wasn’t what they were looking for.
MARTIN
I don’t-- Then what’s the firm?
RUTH
Clyde Ferguson left his
professorship at Rutgers.
Kiki.

MARTIN

RUTH
They haven’t found another black
man to replace him, so someone
decided a woman would be the nextbest thing.
MARTIN
There are more firms. You can’t
give up. This is the biggest city
in the most litigious country in
the history of the world. You can
still-She shuts him up with a kiss.
(CONTINUED)

27

RUTH
Marty. I got a job. Open the
champagne.
For a beat, he searches her face...
MARTIN
Okay. Okay! Let’s celebrate.
As he opens the bottle:
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Y’know what? I think this is
better. I do.
Ruth puts on a record. THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO OVERTURE
begins.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
You won’t be beholden to a firm.
There won’t be partners breathing
down your neck. A professor can
represent any client she wants.
POP! ... The bottle open, he pours.
RUTH
So long as they don’t mind a lawyer
who’s never actually practiced law.
(re: champagne)
Thank you.
MARTIN
(a toast)
Hooray for Mommy!
JANE
Hooray for Mommy!
RUTH
... Hooray for Mommy.
She takes a drink.
BLACK.
HEAR: SCREAMING. CURSING. A MASS OF FURY...
EXT. RUTGERS UNIVERSITY - NEWARK CAMPUS - ACKERSON HALL - DAY
21
Early fall. STUDENT PROTESTORS (20s) throng the urban
boulevards around the MAIN PLAZA STEPS -- across the street
from Rutger’s Law School. Seething. Screaming.

(CONTINUED)

28

And scorched by late-summer heat. They wave placards:
‘Impeach Nixon’; ‘End the War’.
They’re surrounded by A CORDON OF CAMPUS POLICE
OFFICERS.
SUPER: 1970
ON THE STEPS: students hoist enlarged photos of the KENT
STATE MASSACRE. A PROTEST LEADER has a microphone:
PROTEST LEADER
Blood flowed at Kent State. Those
Guardsmen shot blindly into the
crowd. And for what? Was anyone
armed?
No!

STUDENT PROTESTORS

Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg (36 now) approaches the throng.
This isn’t “Occupy” anything. It’s Tahrir Square...
PROTEST LEADER
No! They murdered them. Murdered
them for protesting Nixon’s illegal
and immoral and grotesque war in
Vietnam.
Ruth wedges her way INTO THE CROWD: Student-Protestors all
around. Taller than her. Men, women, white, black. SCREAMING
WITH RAGE. She sees The Protest Leader over their shoulders:
PROTEST LEADER (CONT’D)
And now-- Now we’re told there will
be NO PROSECUTIONS! Are we gonna
stand for it?
No!

STUDENT PROTESTORS

PROTEST LEADER
Are we gonna die in Vietnam?
STUDENT PROTESTORS
Hell no! We won’t go! Hell no! We
won’t go!
As Ruth pushes toward ACKERSON HALL: Campus Police hold the
Students back with billy clubs. She’s jostled. And ignored.

29

INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - LATER
Narrow windows, drop-ceiling, linoleum floor. It’s worlds
away from Harvard...
As Ruth enters, the students find their seats. And watch her
arrange syllabi and lecture notes from her bag in neat piles.
At last she looks them over. An uncomfortable silence...
RUTH
I’m Professor Ginsburg. This is Sex
Discrimination and the Law. ...
Some of my colleagues will tell you
that sex discrimination doesn’t
exist. I may as well be teaching
the legal rights of gnomes and
fairies. Let’s see if they’re
right. ...... Hoyt versus Florida.
State the facts please, Miss...
(checking a class list)
Valentin.
VALENTIN, an Hispanic, blue-collar Jersey Girl, rises.
VALENTIN
Gwendolyn Hoyt was a housewife. And
her husband was this real asshole.
The class CHUCKLES.
RUTH
Can you recall the specifics?
VALENTIN
He cheated on her. He choked her.
He’d rip off her clothes and
threaten to kill her.
RUTH
So in statutory terms... he was a
real asshole.
WHEN THE STUDENTS LAUGH, Ruth seems almost embarrassed by it.
But the room relaxes. Including Ruth.
RUTH (CONT’D)
On the night in question, Clarence
told his wife he had met another
woman, and he was leaving. How did
Hoyt respond, Miss... Burton?
IN THE BACK: BURTON rises.

(CONTINUED)

30

BURTON
She smashed in his skull with a
baseball bat. Then called an
ambulance, while he was dying.
RUTH
A jury convicted Hoyt of seconddegree murder. And that’s where our
story begins. A great civil rights
lawyer took up Hoyt’s appeal.
Dorothy Kenyon.
Ruth writes her name on the board. The students take notes.
RUTH (CONT’D)
On what grounds, Miss... Roemer?
ROEMER, an Angela Davis-type, rises.
ROEMER
That Florida’s juries violated the
U.S. Constitution, ‘cause there
were only men on them. Kenyon said
a jury with women on it may have
convicted Hoyt of a lesser crime,
like manslaughter.
BENNETT, a male student, calls out:
BENNETT
That law makes sense though. Women
can’t take care of their kids, if
they’re on some sequestered jury.
WHOA! It doesn’t go over well with the women in the room.
FEMALE STUDENTS
Excuse me? Are you kidding? (etc.)
BENNETT
What? Men are the mammoth hunters.
BURTON
You’re never getting laid again.
VALENTIN
What about women who don’t have
children?
BURTON
Yeah. Or they’re out of the house.

(CONTINUED)

31

ROEMER
Let the man stay home and take care
of his children. We got work to do.
The women HOOT AND HOLLER.
BENNETT
Hey, hey, hey! Don’t take it out on
me. I’m not holding my fiance back.
She has TWO jobs.
RUTH
Which she can be fired from just
for marrying you. The law allows
it.
That quiets him. And the room.
RUTH (CONT’D)
There are laws that say women can’t
work overtime. A woman’s social
security benefits, unlike her
husband’s, don’t provide for her
family after death...
The class is furious:
STUDENTS
What? ... That’s bullshit. (etc.)
BURTON
We need to do something.
Ruth is thrilled by their passionate response. They recognize
she’s waiting and shush one another...
RUTH
Ten years ago, Dorothy Kenyon asked
a question: if the law
differentiates between people on
the basis of sex, then how will
women and men ever become equals?
And the Supreme Court answered. ...
They won’t. Hoyt lost her appeal.
The decision was unanimous:
discrimination on the basis of sex
is legal.

INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT (1970) - DAY
They’ve come up in the world. The apartment is spacious, with
city views and a balcony. The furniture is contemporary. The
artwork, original. The Roman Opera poster is still prevalent
on a wall. An ARIA plays on the radio.
JANE is stirring blanquette de veau simmering in a pot on the
stove. She’s 15. Pretty, blonde, in a private school uniform.
JANE
Daddy, that’s not how you do it. If
you put the herbs in too early they
lose all their punch.
Martin (37 now, in a French apron) is chopping celery, thyme
& rosemary with a chef’s speed and precision.
MARTIN
The flavors are meant to compliment
one another. Not pummel each other.
As he adds his work to the pot and covers it:
MARTIN (CONT’D)
That’s why it’s called marrying
them.
HEAR: THE FRONT DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE. Then...
JAMES (O.S.)
We’re home!
JANE
Speaking of which...
James bursts in...
Daddy!

JAMES

Martin scoops him up -- matching his tone:
James!

MARTIN

Ruth enters and kisses Martin.
Hi.

RUTH

(change in tone)
Jane.

(CONTINUED)

33

Hey, mom.

JANE

MARTIN
So? How is this year’s class?
As she gets a spoon to taste the stew:
RUTH
These kids are so passionate. To
them it’s about more than
precedents and dissents. They want
to forge a movement.
(re: the stew)
Mmm. This is delicious.
As he does, Jane tries to make her exit.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Hold on Jane. We need to have a
talk. I got a call from her school
today. Apparently I mis-dated a
note excusing you from classes last
week?
Martin is flipping through the Advance Sheets...
JANE
It’s not a big deal.
MARTIN
(sarcastic)
Oh, well, problem solved then.
RUTH
You skipped school. It’s the first
week. Is this what this year’s
going to be like? You lied to-JANE
I never lied.
RUTH
Forging a note IS lying, Jane.
You’re smart enough to know that.
JANE
(leaving)
Apparently I’m not, Mom.
As Ruth follows Jane out...

(CONTINUED)

34

MARTIN
Don’t forget we have the party
tonight.
James, thrilled by the action, tries to follow Ruth out.
Martin grabs him by the back of his shirt.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Oh no. Not you.
IN THE LIVING ROOM: Ruth pursues Jane across the apartment.
RUTH
Jane. ... Jane, stop.
JANE
I apologize, okay?
RUTH
I want to know where you were.
Jane turns back on her.
JANE
Denise and I went to a rally to
hear Gloria Steinem speak.
Ruth looks at her: You did WHAT?
JANE (CONT’D)
(”obviously”)
She’s a writer. She’s starting her
own magazine. She just testified in
the Senate about-RUTH
I know who Gloria Steinem is. What
if you got hurt? Or arrested.
JANE
It was just a rally. Not a riot.
RUTH
Those things can get out of hand.
JANE
I’m fifteen years old. You don’t
have to control every minute of-RUTH
Yes. I do. That’s my job. Your job
is to go to school and learn.

(CONTINUED)

35

JANE
Gloria says we need to un-learn the
status quo.
RUTH
You’re on a first name basis now?
Jane sees Martin coming from the kitchen.
JANE
...You know what, Mom? You may be
satisfied sitting around with your
students talking about how shitty
it is to be a girl-MARTIN
Hey, language.
JANE
But don’t pretend it’s a movement.
It’s not a movement if everyone’s
sitting. That’s a support group.
For Ruth, it stings. Martin sees it.
MARTIN
Jane that’s enough.
RUTH
(to Martin)
We should get going.
JANE
Yeah. Go make yourself pretty for
Daddy’s party.
OFF: Ruth.
INT. WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
Mahogany and marble, the firm’s name in brass. PARTNERS (50s
+), ASSOCIATES (30s) and INTERNS (20s) mingling. All men.
NEAR THE BUFFET: Martin stands out in his short-sleeved,
collared shirt. He’s surrounded by a group of eager Interns.
MARTIN
It is well known. Tax is the only
genuinely funny area of the law.
INTERN 1
I think most of us just want
careers that have more... impact.

(CONTINUED)

36

Martin glances across the room: THE WIVES are segregated in a
corner... But he notes that Ruth is NOT among them. As he
regales the Interns, he continues to scan the room...
MARTIN
Do you know that in Sweden, young
people often don’t get married?
The Interns chuckle. Nervously. Unsure what to say.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
It’s true. They get engaged. Live
together. Raise families. But they
don’t marry. You want to know why?
INTERN 1
They can have sex without it?
The Interns laugh. Not Martin. .... As he finally finds Ruth:
MARTIN
Because of taxes.
IN A CORNER: Alone. Ruth sips a glass of wine, inspecting a
framed, modernist painting. Until her gaze lands on Martin.
Watching her while he talks. She smiles at him.
BACK BY THE BUFFET: Martin continues his lesson. Tipping his
head, he cracks a smile.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
After the war, Sweden decided
married couples should file joint
tax returns. But unlike the United
States, they didn’t give the
couples a benefit. Married Swedes
found themselves in much higher tax
brackets. So, they got divorced.
He knows he’s got them hooked.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
‘Course they kept living together.
NEARBY: TOM MALLER (55, Senior Partner and Martin’s boss)
approaches the buffet and, as he fills a plate, is drawn into
Martin’s story.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
So the government passed a new law.
If a couple got divorced, but
continued living together -- then
for tax purposes they’d still be
considered married. ...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

37

MARTIN (CONT’D)
People did what anyone would. Added
a second entrance to their homes
and a wall down the middle. With a
door for easy access.
The Interns laugh. Tom Maller smiles.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Fine. Once married, now divorced,
two-earner couples in sub-divided
homes would, for tax purposes, be
considered living together and-INTERN 1
And therefore still married.
Martin’s laughing with the Interns now. Ruth arrives. Takes a
glass of wine off a waiter’s tray, and hands it to Martin:
MARTIN
It kept going. For decades. While a
whole generation of Swedes simply
avoided the issue by never getting
married. ... Thanks, Honey. ...
Have you met my wife?
RUTH
The moral of his story is that, in
their attempt to raise revenue, the
Swedish government ruined all those
young men’s best hope at happiness.
MARTIN
Exactly. Because how a government
taxes its citizens is a declaration
of a country’s values.
He turns to look Intern 1 - who challenged him - in the eye.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Now what in the world could have
more impact than that?
As the point hits, Maller puts an arm over Martin’s shoulder.
MALLER
You’d be wise to listen, boys. I
swear to Christ, Martin Ginsburg’ll
be signing all our checks some day.
As Martin smiles modestly, Maller takes it too far:

(CONTINUED)

38

MALLER (CONT’D)
You’re a smart girl, Ruthy. You
married a star.
OFF RUTH: Stung, but biting her tongue.
EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREET - LATER
Ruth walks ahead quietly. Martin sees she’s irritated...
MARTIN
Tom Maller is barely evolved. He
started walking upright last week.
RUTH
You always do that. You act like it
doesn’t matter. But all the little
brush-offs, the dismissive pats on
the head... It matters, Marty.
MARTIN
Why? YOU know what you do is
important.
She keeps walking.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Fine. Next time my boss gives me a
clumsy compliment, I’ll challenge
him to a duel. Will that help?
RUTH
I wouldn’t want to hurt your
stellar reputation.
Martin stops.
MARTIN
What do you want me to do, Ruth?
Should I quit in protest? Tell me
what you want, and I’ll do it.
RUTH
Nothing! I want... Nothing. I want
you to go to work and wow your
bosses and clients.
RUTH (CONT’D)
And be the youngest partner
in the history of the firm.

MARTIN
That’s not fair! Give me a
break.

(CONTINUED)

39

RUTH
And I want you to walk me home,
Marty. So I can sit in my corner
and write a lesson plan to inspire
the next generation of lawyers to
go forth and fight for equality.
MARTIN
What could possibly be more
important than that? I don’t
understand why you’re acting like
it’s a punishment. You’re teaching
young people to change the world!
It comes bursting out:
RUTH
Because that’s what I wanted to do!
As she walks off -- leaving him there -- the admission is as
much a shock to her as it is to him...
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER
Ruth sits at the table that was once in their kitchen in
Cambridge. She’s writing lesson plans, sipping coffee.
She ignores a KNOCK on the door. Martin enters anyway. And
drops, right onto her papers, a small, yellow booklet -- the
TAX COURT ADVANCE SHEETS (TCAS).
Page ten.

MARTIN

RUTH
I don’t read Tax Court cases.
MARTIN
Read this one. The IRS wouldn’t
allow a tax deduction for the
Petitioner to hire a nurse to take
care of an invalid mother.
RUTH
Sounds like a real page-turner.
MARTIN
Ask me why.
RUTH
Marty. I have a lecture to write.

(CONTINUED)

40

He seems to accept it. And heads for the door. But before he
goes, he turns back:
MARTIN
It’s because the Petitioner is a
man.
When she turns to him, he grins -- and is gone. Ruth opens
the TCAS: CHARLES E. MORITZ V. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE...
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER
Martin putts a golf ball under the couch and into a water
cup. When he looks up, Ruth’s in the doorway. TCAS in hand:
RUTH
Section 214 of the tax code assumes
a caregiver has to be a woman. This
is sex-based discrimination...
AGAINST A MAN.
Poor guy.

MARTIN

RUTH
If a federal court ruled that this
law is unconstitutional, it would
become the precedent others refer
to and build on. Men and women
both. It could topple the whole
damn system of discrimination.
She notices the delight on his face.
RUTH (CONT’D)
What? ... What is it?
MARTIN
No. Nothing. I’m just thrilled by
your sudden enthusiasm for tax law.
She puts her arms around him:
RUTH
Marty. We need to take this case.
INT. ACLU RECEPTION AREA - DAY
An open bullpen bustling with the urgency of a Military HQ.
There’s a culture war, and these are front-line soldiers. A
sign over reception: AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION.
(CONTINUED)

41

An elevator slides open, REVEALING RUTH...
She heads for THE RECEPTIONIST, crossing paths with ACLU
STAFFERS (various ages, races, genders), hearing SNIPPETS OF
CONVERSATION:
ACLU STAFFER 1
Of course he says he’s against
bombing Cambodia. I want to know,
where’s his bill to de-fund it?
Another STAFFER is holding up a T-shirt -- a “WANTED: DEAD OR
ALIVE” poster with a cop in the middle.
ACLU STAFFER 2
(to a third staffer)
It’s derogatory. It’s taunting. But
it’s speech. Not conduct.
RUTH
(to receptionist)
Mel Wulf is expecting me.
Phone to her ear, the Receptionist motions for her to wait.
MEL WULF, the ACLU’s Legal Director (40, handsome, wildly
smart), is escorting A GUEST to the elevator:
MEL
I need exact words. Did he say he
wants to get his hands on Nixon, or
that he hopes the Viet Cong do?
He notices Ruth at Reception. And grins mischievously.
ACLU STAFFER 3
Why? What’s the difference?
MEL
Five years in prison. Would you
excuse me?
As Ruth waits, Mel sneaks up behind her...
MEL (CONT’D)
(chanting)
I'm a little acorn round / lying on
the dusty ground...
Ruth spins on him. As Mel jumps into an intricate
choreographed routine of stomps, claps and jazz-hands.

(CONTINUED)

42

MEL (CONT’D)
Everybody steps on me. / So I'm a
little cracked you see...
Everyone stops. To watch. The Receptionist lowers the phone.
Ruth smiles -- blushing.
MEL (CONT’D)
I'm a nut / but that's no sin. / At
Camp Che-na-wah, I'll fit right in.
Arms spread. Breathing heavy. A broad grin.
MEL (CONT’D)
Ladies and gentlemen. The threetime Camp Che-na-wah All-Around
Camper: Ruth “Kiki” Bader.
A smattering of APPLAUSE. As Mel struts toward Ruth, he jokes
to a laughing colleague...
MEL (CONT’D)
Hey. You think this job’s hard? I
used to judge the fifteen-andunders with a color war trophy on
the line.
(to Ruth)
Hi Kiki. Whaddya say?
INT. ACLU OFFICES - CORRIDOR - LATER
Ruth follows Mel down a crowded hallway. He’s reading the Tax
Court Advance Sheets as they walk.
MEL
You said you had a case. This is
not A case. It’s the opening salvo
in a fifty-year war for a new class
of civil rights.
RUTH
Yes! Exactly!
MEL
I can’t help you. This is beyond my
mandate.
RUTH
American CIVIL LIBERTIES Union.
Women’s right are civil rights.

(CONTINUED)

43

MEL
I’m still getting flack for
defending draft card burners. And a
right to protest actually exists.
He hands Ruth the Advance Sheets. As they stop before his
office: “Melvin Wulf / Legal Director”. He opens the door.
But neither moves.
After you.

MEL (CONT’D)

INT. MEL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Mel closes the door behind them. Then relaxes into his chair,
feet up on the desk. As Ruth sits across from him:
MEL
How’s Marty? Still protecting the
rich from the predations of the
poor?
She gives him a look.
RUTH
If we’re going to appeal, the court
needs to agree there’s a
constitutional handle here.
MEL
How did you even convince this guy
to let you represent him?
RUTH
I’ll take care of that. Alone, the
judges-MEL
Are you kidding me?
RUTH
The judges may not give Marty and I
the benefit of the doubt. But with
your name alongside ours on the
brief...
He considers her...
RUTH (CONT’D)
You must see the opportunity this
case represents.

(CONTINUED)

44

MEL
You think judges will be
sympathetic because they all have
prostates? Men and women eat at the
same lunch counters. We drink at
the same fountains. We go to the
same schools.
RUTH
Women can’t attend Dartmouth.
MEL
Men can’t go to Smith.
RUTH
Women police officers can’t patrol
New York City streets. We have to
get credit cards in our husbands’
names.
MEL
You’re fifty-one percent of the
population. You’re not even a
minority. Anyway, it’s been tried.
Muller. Goesaert. What’s-her-name
with the baseball bat.
RUTH
Gwendolyn Hoyt.
Exactly.

MEL

RUTH
And morally, they were right.
MEL
Yet they lost. Look around you,
Ruth. Morality doesn’t win the day.
Dorothy Kenyon couldn’t even get
women equality arguing a case with
sex, murder, and prison-time on the
line. You and Marty really think
you’re gonna do it with this guy
and his taxes?
EXT. ACLU’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
A tower in Manhattan’s financial district. A man holds the
door for Ruth -- and she takes the other. She storms past
Business Men and Secretaries. Taxis and phone booths. The
sound of CAR HORNS AND CONSTRUCTION is oppressive. As she
disappears down THE STEPS OF A SUBWAY STATION...

A MOMENT LATER: Ruth re-emerges. Eyeing A PHONE BOOTH... She
steps inside.
RUTH
(into the phone)
Operator. I need a number. ...
Denver, Colorado.
EXT. LEXINGTON AVE. - DAY
MARTIN’S ON THE CORNER, waving down a cab. As it pulls over,
he’s urging Ruth, Jane and James to hurry up...
MARTIN
C’mon! C’mon!
DOWN ON THE BLOCK: They’re hurrying. Jane pulling Ruth’s bag.
RUTH
(to Jane)
You’re going to have to get James
from school while I’m in Denver.
JANE
Mom. I told you, Denise and I are
starting our consciousness-raising
group.
RUTH
Then take James with you.
(looking them over)
Will you be all right?
Jane puts a hand on James’s shoulder.
JANE
We’ll survive somehow. Go kick ass.
Martin’s loading her bag:
MARTIN
Meter’s running.
Ruth approaches him...
RUTH
What if I can’t convince him?
MARTIN
What if you never try?
They kiss. And she gets in the taxi...

(CONTINUED)

46

Martin watches it all the way down the street.
JAMES
Daddy. Why’s Mommy going to Denver?
MARTIN
She’s climbing a mountain.
E/I. MORITZ HOUSE - DENVER - DAY
Ruth walks up the path to a modest home in a leafy Denver
suburb. She rings the bell. No answer. She knocks, waits
patiently. And finally tries looking through a nearby window.
MORITZ (O.S.)
Mrs. Ginsburg...
She’s startled. The front door has opened to reveal CHARLES
MORITZ (60’s, lived-in face, no shoes).
MORITZ (CONT’D)
You’re early.
RUTH
(checking her watch)
I can come back in ten minutes, if
you prefer.
MORITZ
You might as well come in now and
have your say.
Ruth follows him into THE ENTRYWAY, where he indicates for
her to removes her shoes. As she slips off her heels, her
mountain seems steeper.
INT. MORITZ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Moritz points out a sofa where Ruth can wait...
MORITZ
I’ll be with you in a minute.
He crosses the room to his MOTHER (85). In a wheelchair by a
window. Napkin tucked into her shirt. Tomato Soup on a TV
tray beside her.
MORITZ (CONT’D)
Mother. This is Ruth Ginsburg. The
New York lawyer I told you about.

(CONTINUED)

47

RUTH
Mrs. Moritz... hello.
Moritz’s Mother gives Ruth a dismissive look. To her son:
MORITZ’S MOTHER
I thought she’d be bigger.
As Ruth waits, she looks at family photos on the mantle. One
in particular catches her eye: a young, proud Charlie as the
drum major in a marching band.
RUTH
I see you were a drum major. I was
a twirler.
MORITZ
That was a thousand years ago.
So much for making a connection. Ruth pulls out a legal pad.
Moritz finishes feeding his mom. He hands her a large-print
crossword puzzle and tries to put a pencil in her hand, which
SHAKES uncontrollably. Eventually, she secures it.
Moritz returns to Ruth.
RUTH
Mr. Moritz. About your case...
MORITZ
I don’t have a case. Four lawyers
told me so before I went to Court
myself and asked for justice. And
that judge... Tietjens, he
basically said I was a tax cheat.
Are you?

RUTH

MORITZ
I’ve never cheated at anything in
my life!
Suddenly, from the other side of the room... and LOUD!
MORITZ’S MOTHER
“Tasmanian egg-layer.” Eight
letters.
MORITZ
Not now, Mom.

(CONTINUED)

48

RUTH
(ready to take notes)
Tell me in your own words: why did
you hire a nurse?
MORITZ
If you’ve never cared for an ailing
parent...
RUTH
(pained by the memory)
I have.
He’s surprised.
MORITZ
Then you know. Between the
dressing, the bathing, the toilet.
It’s not a task for one person.
Especially when you have a day job.
If it weren’t for Cleeta, I’d have
to put mom in a home.
RUTH
And so you deducted Cleeta’s salary
on your taxes.
MORITZ’S MOTHER
“Tasmanian egg-layer.” Second
letter L.
MORITZ
Mom. I’ll help you in a bit.
RUTH
(loudly, helpfully)
How about ‘Platypus’?
Moritz’s Mother writes it down. Ruth smiles to Moritz. He
doesn’t smile back.
MORITZ
I’m a salesman Mrs. Ginsburg. I
know when I’m being sold.
RUTH
With due respect, you have $296 at
issue. I’m not here for the money.
We’d represent your appeal probono, if you’ll let us.
MORITZ
The judge said that Tax Code is
plain.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

49

MORITZ (CONT'D)
The caregiver deduction is
available to all women. But only to
men whose wives are incapacitated
or dead. Or who are divorced.
RUTH
And you’ve never been married. ...
The men who wrote that law couldn’t
even fathom that a bachelor
choosing to take care of a parent
at home might exist.
MORITZ
So... what? The judge was wrong?
RUTH
Mr. Moritz, the LAW is wrong.
He takes a beat to respond.
MORITZ
You’re a long way from home. You
must be hungry after your trip.
Ruth nods with a smile.
INT. MORITZ RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - LATER
Moritz is making cold-cut sandwiches -- mixing his own
mustard-horseradish spread. Ruth is at a small table.
MORITZ
What’s so difficult for my mother
is that she’s KNOWS she’s fading.
And there’s nothing she can do to
stop it.
Ruth considers it...
RUTH
The hardest part for MY mom... It
must have been-- When she was
young, she was expected to tend to
her father and brother, instead of
going to college. ... The idea that
now her daughter... that I was
taking care of her...
MORITZ
How did you manage to do both? You
were just a girl.

(CONTINUED)

50

RUTH
And you’re ‘just an unmarried man.’
(she thinks about it...)
We both confounded expectations.
He finishes the sandwiches and sits. Ruth bites into hers.
RUTH (CONT’D)
This is delicious. I was famished.
He watches her eat for a moment.
Moritz’s Mother and her nurse, Cleeta (70), pass by IN THE
HALL...
MORITZ
If it’s not for the money, then why
are you here?
She puts down the sandwich.
RUTH
The 14th Amendment to the United
States Constitution says all people
must be treated equally under the
law. And yet, there are... I don’t
know how many laws -- like the
caregiver deduction -- that say, in
effect, women stay home, and men go
to work, and that it should stay
that way forever. ... I want to
convince the federal courts that
those laws are unconstitutional.
MORITZ
(impressed)
How do you do that?
RUTH
One case at a time. Starting with
yours. We’ll submit a brief stating
our argument. Then the government
will submit a response. And both
sides will present oral arguments
at the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals, here in Denver.
MORITZ
(a knowing smile)
So I’m a guinea pig?

(CONTINUED)

51

RUTH
No, sir. You’re the man marching
out ahead of the band, leading the
way. Just like the drum major you
used to be.
He smiles.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Can you imagine, Charlie, if our
moms had grown up in a world where
girls could dream as big as boys?
She looks back to him. It’s plain in his look: he’s in.
EXT. WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES - NIGHT
A brisk autumn evening. Martin and Tom Maller come out of the
building. As they look and cross the street:
MALLER
For God’s sake. I’ve invested a lot
of my own reputation building up
your career. Now you’re wanna dump
it down the toilet for some
cockamamie case?
MARTIN
My contract says I need permission
to take outside work. So I’m
asking. But-MALLER
You’re on track to be the youngest
partner at the firm. Do yourself a
favor. Don’t blow it.
He notices Martin’s slowing down...
MALLER (CONT’D)
I thought you live uptown?

(CONTINUED)

52

MARTIN
I’m picking up Ruth’s dry-cleaning
around the corner.
MALLER
Jesus Christ. ... What are you doing
this for Marty? You’re gonna go
blindly traipsing into this case...
for what? So the little woman can
feel like she’s a real lawyer?
MARTIN
(holding in his fury)
Tom. I am determined to-MALLER
You really want to support her?
Tell her the truth.
Which is?

MARTIN

MALLER
The case is unwinnable. You must
know that. Congress can write
whatever taxes it wants. That’s not
open to constitutional attack.
MARTIN
You only say that because no one’s
ever done it successfully before.
MALLER
Fine. So try it. I won’t stop you.
Martin’s relieved.
MALLER (CONT’D)
But when you lose, be ready for
your career to come crashing back
to Earth.
As Maller leaves, checking his watch, Martin weighs the
warning...
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - NIGHT
ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE: A dog-eared copy of TO KILL A
MOCKINGBIRD, and an essay by Jane, crossed out and marked up
in red pen -- “Atticus Finch: Great American Lawyer.”
RUTH
Murder can never be condoned. Least
of all by a lawyer.
(CONTINUED)

53

JANE
It’s called justice, mom.
RUTH
What’s just to you may not be just
to me or to someone else.
IN THE FOYER: Martin enters.
JANE
You know what I mean.
MARTIN
Good evening!
Ignored, Martin notices THE BOOK on the table.
JANE
Would it kill you to admit that
maybe I’m actually right about
something? This is an ‘A’ paper!
RUTH
Of course it is. You’re a beautiful
writer. That’s not the point.
MARTIN
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! ... Please tell
me you’re not going ten rounds over
To Kill A Mockingbird.
JANE
Daddy. Tell her Atticus Finch can
be a role model.
RUTH
He covers up Bob Ewell’s murder. He
is a terrible lawyer.
JANE
Why? ‘Cause you say so?
RUTH
Not me. Canon One of The
American Bar Association’s
Model Code of Professional
Responsi--

JANE (CONT'D)
... What are you talking
about?!

RUTH
Legal ethics.
JANE
You’d do exactly the same thing -if you actually had a heart.
(CONTINUED)

54

MARTIN
All right. That’s enough.
She storms off -- disappearing DOWN THE HALL. HER DOOR SLAMS.
RUTH
I don’t know where she gets her
stubbornness.
Martin lets it lie.
As Ruth goes to THE DINING ROOM TABLE, and copies onto a note
card a quote from a legal tome:
MARTIN
... So how are you?
She looks at him: How am I? ... Then picks up one of the
books open beside her, and hands it to him -- highlighted:
MARTIN (CONT’D)
(reading aloud)
“History discloses that woman has
always been dependent upon man.
Like children, she needs special
care. This justifies a difference
in legislation.”
RUTH
Muller v Oregon. The law of the
land.
She picks up another book...
RUTH (CONT’D)
Or Bradwell v Illinois.
(reading aloud)
“The destiny of woman is the benign
offices of wife and mother. This is
the law of the Creator.” ... And
for how long have you been hearing
the voice of the Creator, Justice
Bradley?
MARTIN
Maybe The Creator submitted an
amicus brief.
RUTH
On a stone tablet, no doubt.
She tosses the book aside.

(CONTINUED)

55

RUTH (CONT’D)
I’m writing this brief, and citing
the same cases, coming up against
the exact same precedents as
everyone before us. If this is what
we go in with...
With a look, he shares her worry.
FROM JANE’S BEDROOM comes BLARING MUSIC: “OHIO” by Crosby,
Stills and Nash. Ruth and Martin share a look.
When Ruth moves to get up, Martin waves her back...
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - JANE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jane over her math homework is the mirror-image of Ruth with
her brief. Martin KNOCKS and enters.
I’m busy.

JANE

He turns down the record. When Jane looks up at him, he’s
surprised to see her eyes are welled with tears...
Come here.

MARTIN

She sits beside him on the bed. And for a beat, lets him hug
her... Then shrugs him off.
JANE
I’m fine. I can be as tough as she
is. ... She’s a bully. She needs
everybody to know how smart she is.
MARTIN
You want Mommy to stop being smart?
JANE
I want her to stop rubbing it in
everyone’s face all the time.
(off his look)
Don’t tell me she doesn’t.
MARTIN
Rubbing it in people’s faces is the
only way she’s ever gotten anyone
to notice.
Jane hears him.

(CONTINUED)

56

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Grandma Celia died when Mom was
about your age. But right up to her
dying breath, they would read
together, and debate ideas, and
she’d make mom question everything.
... Jane, Mom isn’t bullying you.
She doesn’t want you to feel small.
She wants to share what her mother
taught her. .... That’s how she
shows her heart.
Jane is touched.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Maybe she overdoes it sometimes.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - LATER
Ruth is at the typewriter, still working.
Martin enters. Takes one of her reference books. And joins
her. Ruth looks up and watches him. ... Until he notices.
RUTH
Is she okay?
MARTIN
She’ll be fine.
They resume working. Together. Until Ruth looks up again...
RUTH
I love you.
MARTIN
I love you.
EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY
A SHOP OWNER cleans graffiti off his store window. Cast iron
facades. Pot-holed streets. Dumpsters overflowing. And
against the gray sky, the Twin Towers are being built.
In her up-town coat, Ruth is out of place. Searching for an
address. Beside her, Jane, in a short skirt and knee-highs,
hugs her denim jacket tighter against the blustery, lateautumn cold.
JANE
This is stupid. You’re the one who
said I’m supposed to be in school.

(CONTINUED)

57

RUTH
If you’re going to write about
Great American Lawyers, you may as
well meet one.
They come to a derelict building with an empty storefront.
Share a wary look. And step over a drunk, passed out on the
sidewalk. Entering...
INT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
As they come DOWN A LONG HALLWAY, Ruth grabs Jane’s wrist,
holding her back. Awestruck.
DOROTHY KENYON is locking a door marked “Attorney” in peeling
paint. She’s slender, with a white bob beneath a broadrimmed, floppy hat. Her eyes are vivacious; they can flash
from humor to fiery passion without blinking.
Door locked, she turns. And finds them.
KENYON
You ladies look lost.
Ruth watches her -- a long beat.
KENYON (CONT’D)
Well, spit it out.
RUTH
Ms. Kenyon. We’re here to see you.
I tried to make an appointment.
KENYON
Here I am. I don’t have all day.
RUTH
... It’s about Gwendolyn Hoyt.
KENYON
Ah. In that case I have no interest
in talking to either one of you.
She shoves the keys into her large bag. As she blows by them,
Ruth and Jane follow.
RUTH
I’m arguing a case... Sexdiscrimination violates the equal
protection principle.

(CONTINUED)

58

KENYON
‘Equal Protection’ was coined to
grant equality to the negro -- a
task at which it has dismally
failed. What makes you think women
would fare any better?
RUTH
Please. If we could just talk for-Kenyon turns on them:
KENYON
You wanna know how I blew it, that
it? What I’d do differently? Why?
You think you can change the
country?
She indicates Jane, who is taken by surprise.
KENYON (CONT’D)
You should look to her generation.
They’re taking to the streets.
Demanding change. Like we did when
we fought for the vote.
Jane gives Ruth an “I told ya so” look.
KENYON (CONT’D)
Our mistake was thinking we’d won.
We started asking please. As if
civil rights were sweets to be
handed out by judges.
RUTH
Protests are important. But
changing the culture means nothing,
if the law doesn’t change. As a
lawyer, you must believe that.

(CONTINUED)

59

KENYON
Let me guess: you’re a professor,
aren’t you? Yeah. A ton of
knowledge, and no smarts.
JANE
Mom. We should go.
KENYON
You want advice? Here it is. Tell
your client she won’t find equality
in a courtroom.
She walks away... Ruth following:
RUTH
My client’s name is Charles Moritz.
KENYON
That’s cute.
RUTH
He hired a nurse who helps care for
his mother. But he was denied a
caregiver deduction on his taxes.
Kenyon does the calculation. It takes her a beat -- but just
a beat -- to put it together. Kenyon stops.
KENYON
He’s never been married. You found
a bachelor taking care of his
mother at home? .... The judges
will be repulsed by him.
RUTH
Feeling anything is a start.
KENYON
... What did you say your name was?
RUTH
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
She and Kenyon watch one another for an extended beat.
KENYON
Well... Sorry Professor Ginsburg.
Maybe someday. But the country
isn’t ready. Change minds first.
Then change the law. ...

60

KENYON (CONT'D)
If you’ll excuse me, the mayor’s
decided to rename the neighborhood,
so now a developer’s kicking thirty
families out of a building he
abandoned ten years ago.
As she heads to the stairwell...
KENYON (CONT’D)
... SoHo. Who’s ever heard of such
a ridiculous thing?
Ruth and Jane share a look: Whoa.
EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - SIDEWALK - LATER
It’s raining hard as Ruth and Jane exit. They open their
umbrellas. Ruth looks back the way they came. Then points
Jane in the other direction.
RUTH
Let’s catch a cab.
They start walking.
JANE
I know she's your personal hero and
all. But she's kind of a bitch.
RUTH
No. She’s formidable. ... Dorothy
Kenyon has been fighting for Civil
Rights and Women’s Rights and Labor
Rights her entire career. She
didn’t always win. But she made
damn sure she was taken seriously.
The rain is pelting down. Ruth and Jane take cover under a
scaffolding. A cab passes, but its dome light is off. They
lower their umbrellas.
JANE
She didn’t help you. ... What are
you going to do?
RUTH
It’s the right cause. It’s the
right client. But women have been
losing this same argument for over
a century.
JANE
Well... just because you lost a
hundred years before you started is
no reason not to try to win.
Ruth considers it... And realizes:
(CONTINUED)

61

RUTH
Jane. That was incredibly wise.
JANE
Do you know who said it first?
(Ruth doesn’t)
Atticus Finch.
In Ruth’s look: “Touché.”
Across the street, two CON ED WORKERS SHOUT and WHISTLE at them
lasciviously.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Lookin’ good, ladies. We’ll warm
you up... if you’re getting wet.
RUTH
(checking for another cab)
It’s okay. Just ignore them.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Too good for us, huh? Bitches!
Jane SHOUTS back at them.
JANE
Real nice. You kiss your mother
with that mouth? Asshole.
That shuts the Workers up. Jane sees Ruth’s surprise.
JANE (CONT’D)
Mom. You can’t just let boys talk
to you like that.
At that moment, Jane sees a vacant cab approaching. She
dashes out fearlessly and YELLS:
TAXI!

JANE (CONT’D)

The cab BRAKES sharply. Ruth starts out after her, but stops
mid-street. Jane’s at the cab door.
Ruth looks around at the constructions workers tearing down
buildings, wild posting for a Joni Mitchell concert; a couple
making out; sexy women on a billboard...
JANE (CONT’D)
Mom, c’mon.
(to the TAXI DRIVER)
Yeah, yeah. Hold on a second.
She returns to her mother. She’s not sure what’s going on...
JANE (CONT’D)
He’s not gonna wait forever. You’re
getting soaked.

62

RUTH
Twenty years.
(a beat)
Look at you. It may as well be two
hundred.
JANE
You lost me.
RUTH
It’s only twenty years since I was
your age. Back then girls were
told: “Be a lady.” “Speak when
spoken to.” “Respect your elders.”
Jane’s getting where her mom is headed...
JANE
Now it’s ‘Don’t trust anyone over
thirty!’
RUTH
They taught me how to curtsy in
school.
(laughs)
I couldn’t go out wearing pants.
JANE
I’m not even wearing a bra.
The cabbie HONKS impatiently.
RUTH
You are a liberated, fearless young
woman. Twenty years ago, you
couldn’t have been who you are
today.
(a beat)
Dorothy Kenyon’s wrong. The times
have already changed.
BEGIN -- BRIEF-WRITING SEQUENCE:
INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - EVENING
Ruth. Alone. Consulting a book. Hunched over a legal pad.

INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Ruth’s standing at the counter. Eating leftovers. Martin is
reading the typed notes. Concerned...
RUTH
“A court ought not be affected by
the weather of the day. But will be
by the climate of the era.”
MARTIN
Okay... So we’re not re-fighting
the old cases.
RUTH
We’re arguing the precedents should
no longer apply.
MARTIN
But Ruth, Freund was talking about
Brown v. Board of Ed. That was a
once-in-a-generation case.
RUTH
And we’re the next generation.
OFF MARTIN: impressed.
INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - FACULTY OFFICES - DAY
Ruth is dictating her notes to a department secretary,
MILLICENT (28, sultry), who is typing them up.

On the wall over her desk, Ruth tacks up the same note card.

INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - FACULTY OFFICES - DAY
CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER KEYS STRIKING THE PAPER: “Changes in
societal attitudes.” ... “Unalterable biological traits.”
INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - EVENING
Ruth’s added a coffee pot to the room. Some of her class is
with her. They’re passing books, newspapers, journals -- and
Chinese food cartons -- between them. Animated. Discussing.
OVER THIS, START TO HEAR: MILLICENT’S TYPING...
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT
AS THE TYPING CONTINUES, GETTING LOUDER...
Ruth and Martin walking -- dressed in overcoats:
MARTIN
Our client is a man. We can’t lose
sight of that. Men are also harmed

Millicent is typing up their hand-written pages...
She pulls out the final page.

Millicent enters -- the typed Moritz Brief in hand:
MILLICENT
Professor Ginsburg? I finished
typing the brief.
RUTH
(accepting it)
You’re a saint, Millicent.
MILLICENT
May I make an observation? ... It’s
just... I’m typing your brief. And
jumping out all over it is, well...
sex-sex-sex-sex-sex-sex. It reeks
of hormones and backseats and-- You
know how men are. Maybe you should
try a less distracting word.
She and Ruth exchange a look...
MILLICENT (CONT’D)
Maybe... gender?
RUTH
You realize that means...
MILLICENT
That’s no problem. I’m happy to
type it again.
Off Ruth: END SEQUENCE.

ACLU STAFFER 4

throat out myself!
As he opens his OFFICE DOOR:
KENYON (O.S.)
Melvin. Didn’t your mother ever
teach you to clean your room?
INT. MEL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
She’s sitting behind his desk. Reading a newspaper -- THE
IDAHO STATESMAN. Mel, surprised, enters and closes the door.
MEL
Ms. Kenyon. Is it time for your
annual dusting-off already?
Kenyon laughs. As she folds her newspaper...
KENYON
In 1776, Abigail Adams wrote her
husband a letter. “As you write
this new constitution,” she said,
“Remember the ladies.” Know what
the bastard went ahead and did?
MEL
I can guess.
She slams the paper down, the article oriented toward him:
“COURT FINDS FOR CECIL REED.”
MEL (CONT’D)
The Idaho Statesman? You need a

She taps the newspaper article with her finger.
KENYON (CONT’D)
The Idaho Supreme Court just said
that is perfectly legal.
With some effort, she gets up. Taking her over-sized bag with
her. As she does:
MEL

protestors in jail in California.
I’ve got schools in Mississippi
that still refuse to desegrega-KENYON
Eh, you’re a sissy. The Board

That’s not-- I don’t have the
resources to take this on.
KENYON
I’ve seen you stand up to the might
of government with sling and stone
for what you know is right. And
kid, I loved ya for it. They’re not
gonna fire you, Mel. The board’s a
bunch of tired old fools, and they
don’t have the nerve to do it. I
should know; I’m one of ‘em.

She pats him on the cheek.
KENYON
You’re a good boy.
INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
The Fourteenth Amendment is written on the board. Ruth,
before her class, underlines the Equal Protection Clause...
RUTH
But nowhere does the Constitution
say the federal government must
treat people equally. What did the

PARKER
That the Due Process Clause implies
that Equal Protection applies to
the federal government as well.

INT. DINER - DAY
Ruth and Mel with coffee. Only Mel is eating pie. He reaches
into his bag -- and drops Ruth’s brief between them. An
accusation in his eyes.
MEL
It was well played Ruth, sending
your work to Kenyon.
RUTH
(playing innocent)
I thought she might have advice.
MEL
Cut the shit. Just don’t play games
with me again.
They stare each other down for a beat...
RUTH
What did you think of the brief?
MEL
(admitting it)
It’s a compelling argument.
Brilliantly reasoned. These days
more women than ever are working.
And why not? We have pre-schools
and washing machines and cheap
contraceptives.
RUTH
Times have changed.
MEL
But there’s a glaring problem... In
the unlikely event that you win
this thing -- what’s the remedy?
The Court takes away the Caregiver
Deduction from everyone -including working mothers. And then
you’ve done more harm than good.
RUTH
No. Do you remember Justice
Harlan’s opinion last June in Welsh
v United States?

MEL
(getting it, impressed)
He said laws could be extended,
when doing so would be closer to
the legislature's intent than
overturning would be.
RUTH
We’re adding one more section to
the brief, urging The Court to
extend the law -- to include
Charlie as well as everyone else.
Mel runs through the argument in his mind. It could work.
MEL
I still say I’d rather be a woman
in America than a black man. Or a
socialist. Or religious minority...
But the ACLU will put its name on
your brief.
RUTH
We appreciate your support.
She gives it a beat...
RUTH (CONT’D)
Now let’s talk about you taking on
Reed v Reed.
(off his look)
All men in Idaho are better at
math?! It’s a perfect example of-MEL
Quit while you’re ahead, Kiki. One
case. That’s all you get.
As he goes for his wallet:
RUTH
The Moritz argument works just as
well for a female client. And
Reed’s a state supreme court case.
Which means the US Supreme Court
must hear the appeal.
(he’s ignoring her)
Call Sally Reed’s lawyer, Mel.
MEL
I told you, I’m not starting
another fifty-year battle. I’d
worry about defending my own case,
if I were you.
He tosses some cash on the table. And rises to go.
(CONTINUED)

71

MEL (CONT’D)
I expect to see your Remedy
argument before you submit to the
Tenth Circuit. And I want to be
there when you practice your oral
arguments.
(before she can protest)
We’re holding a moot court. That’s
not negotiable.
RUTH
(relenting)
When?
MEL
As soon as we get the government’s
response brief.
EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) - DAY
Imposing, limestone facade -- gray in the winter-morning
light. Over the entry: “Justice is founded in the rights
bestowed by nature upon man.”
BOZARTH (V.O.)
...A pig ‘aint good for nothing but
sitting in its own filth.
INT. DOJ - TAX DIVISION - BOZARTH’S CUBICLE - DAY
JIM BOZARTH (26), a Government Lawyer, is full of airy,
likeable, college-boy confidence. In his uncluttered cubicle:
a photo of his wife and a University of Texas coffee mug.
He’s yukking it up with A COLLEAGUE (25):
BOZARTH
It’s the first rule of barbecue.
You start with a cow.
COLLEAGUE
Well, you could try up in Columbia
Heights, if not for... you know,
the riots.
BOZARTH
For a slab of beef cooked low and
slow? I’ll pack my ..45.
GLADYS (55) approaches before him with a file cart. A
reliable cog in the machine of government. She hands him a
brief. And a clipboard.

(CONTINUED)

72

GLADYS (V.O.)
Bozarth. You finished a case today.
As Bozarth’s Colleague takes his leave, she passes Bozarth
his new assignment...
GLADYS
Sign for your next brief.
INSERT: Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals / Charles Moritz v
Commissioner of Internal Revenue / Authors - Ruth Bader
Ginsburg; Martin Ginsburg; Melvin Wulf, Legal Director, ACLU.
Bozarth lets out a long whistle.
BOZARTH
10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Know
who I am, Gladys?
GLADYS
Sure do. You’re the kid who’s going
to sign my form.
BOZARTH
(as he does -- grinning)
I’m a guy moving up in the world.
He settles in, feet on the desk -- and opens the brief.
GLADYS
In the meantime, the chief best not
catch you with your feet on that
desk.
He takes them down. And re-opens the brief.
BOZARTH
Howdy, Mr. Moritz. And what can
your Uncle Sam do for you today?
INT. DOJ - TAX DIVISION OFFICES - LATER
Brief in hand, Bozarth heads down a hallway to a closed door
marked “Special Attorney / Tax Division”. Stops. Prepares
himself. ... THEN KNOCKS.
BROWN (THROUGH DOOR)
... What is it?

73

INT. DOJ - BROWN’S OFFICE - LATER
The room is utilitarian. Straight lines and right angles.
With an orderly and organized charm that’s inviting.
(Professor) Brown is 65 now. Dignified. Finished to a high
polish. He’s at his desk reading the brief. Bozarth watches.
BOZARTH
You can’t make a constitutional
challenge to the Tax Code. Right?
BROWN
(still reading)
It’s a stretch.
BOZARTH
And who’s ever heard of ‘gender
discrimination?’
Brown gives him a look. Then finishes reading.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
These folks are runnin’ at Hell
with a bucket of water.
BROWN
Case law is filled with challenges
that could not be made... Until
they were. I’m putting Murphy on
writing our response brief.
BOZARTH
With due respect, Mr. Brown-BROWN
It isn’t personal, Bozarth. But if
we’re not careful, this appeal will
cast a cloud of unconstitutionality
over every federal law that
differentiates between men and
women. I need someone more seasoned
on it.
For Bozarth, it’s a body blow. Brown picks up his phone...
BROWN (CONT’D)
Could you get me the Solicitor
General, please?
Bozarth summons his courage.
BOZARTH
I pulled the file. I deserve the
chance. Murphy’s a weak sister.
(CONTINUED)

74

Brown gives him a dismissive look. Bozarth leans in.
Firm:
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
I know how to win this case, sir.
Better than Murphy. Better than
anyone. You need me on this appeal.
Brown stares. A bit impressed. A bit dubious... Before he can
decide, someone picks up on the other end of the line.
BROWN
(eyes still on Bozarth)
This is Brown. I need to see him.
EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
A cold day. The ground dusted with snow. But (Dean) Erwin
Griswold doesn’t seem to notice. He’s 67 now, and Nixon’s
Solicitor General. Brown and Bozarth walk with him...
GRISWOLD
For God’s sake! Where does it end?
Gender equality as a civil right?!
BROWN
When everyone’s aggrieved and a
victim. It’s what the ACLU does.
Divide the country into smaller and
smaller subgroups.
GRISWOLD
Ginsburg... Cancer, right? And the
wife. Very demanding.
But smart.

BROWN

GRISWOLD
Ten years. Ten years I fought to
enroll women at Harvard Law. The
faculty, the university -- even my
wife warned me it could come back
to haunt me. Now this is the thanks
I get.
BROWN
Erwin, we could settle. Martin
Ginsburg was one of my best
students. A practical young man. I
can call him, tell him we’ll let
the man have his money. And we go
our separate ways.
Griswold thinks about it for a beat...
(CONTINUED)

75

GRISWOLD
No. ... No. We settle now, it’s
open season. Let’s put the idea of
gender discrimination to bed once
and for all. They handed us a
winnable case.
BROWN
(on the mission)
Then we’ll win it.
Griswold talks of Bozarth as if the young man weren’t there:
GRISWOLD
You’re sure he’s up to it.
BROWN
Mr. Bozarth is a fine litigator.
(to Bozarth)
Tell him your idea.
BOZARTH
We list the laws.
What laws?

GRISWOLD

BOZARTH
All of ‘em. Every federal law that
treats men and women differently.
So the Court sees exactly the can
of worms these folks are-Griswold’s belly-laugh interrupts him. Until, looking between
Brown and Bozarth, Griswold realizes it’s not a joke.

(CONTINUED)

76

GRISWOLD
Last I checked, the U.S. Code was
20,000 pages long.
(to Brown)
Whose gonna read it? Him?
BOZARTH
I can get it done, sir. All I need
is an introduction.
Griswold’s interest is piqued.
To whom?

GRISWOLD

Bozarth knows exactly how outrageous it sounds:
BOZARTH
... The Secretary of Defense.
EXT. THE PENTAGON - DAY
Sprawling. It dwarfs the Washington Monument in the distance.
INT. THE PENTAGON - DAY
Reels of magnetic tape spin. Glowing switches CLACK. And the
whole room HUMS. A KEYPUNCH OPERATOR (female, 22) hands a box
of punch cards to one of a dozen TECHNICIANS (male).
Through plate glass, Brown and Bozarth watch from a hallway.
BROWN
And this computer will find what
we’re looking for?
BOZARTH
In just a few days.
BROWN
Without any human being actually
reading the laws. ... What a
horrifying age.
INT. RUTGERS LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - EVENING
The Students are filing out. Talking among themselves.
Murmuring their thanks and goodbye. SEE: Roemer, Burton,
Valentin, Parker, Bennett amongst them...

(CONTINUED)

77

STUDENTS
Thank you, Professor. .....
Good night. ... Thanks,
Professor Ginsburg.

RUTH
Good night. ... Thank you.
.... That was a persuasive
analysis of Gruenwald v
Gardner, Mr. Bennett.

BENNETT
Hey thanks, Professor G.
COURIER (O.S.)
Ruth Bader Ginsburg?
Everyone stops to see him standing in the doorway with a
thick envelope in hand.
COURIER (CONT’D)
Delivery from the Department of
Justice.
She signs for it and accepts. Then opens the envelope -- all
eyes on her:
RUTH
It’s the government’s response
brief.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - NIGHT
Twenty volumes of THE U.S. CODE stacked around the room. Open
and empty cartons from the ACLU...
Ruth, Jane and Ruth’s students Roemer and Burton are seated
AROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE. In the middle of them, the
brief is open to “Appendix E”. Each has a volume before her,
and is looking from the Appendix to her book, searching for
the corresponding page.
ROEMER
Get this: there’s a law that we’re
not allowed to fly military cargo
planes?
BURTON
Why would you want to?
JANE
That’s not the point. We should be
allowed.
ROEMER
You really think you can change all
these laws?

(CONTINUED)

78

RUTH
That’s the plan.
The FRONT DOOR opens, and Martin enters. Dry cleaning over
his shoulder.
MARTIN
Ruth are you ready? Curtain’s up in
forty minutes. It’d be nice to get
there on time.
(to himself)
For a change.
He enters the DINING ROOM.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
RUTH
The Government’s brief came. ...
Look who’s listed as co-author.
She passes it to him.
MARTIN
I had heard Griswold was trying to
recruit Brown to the DOJ. I guess
it worked. ... How does it look?
BURTON
Check out Appendix E.
Martin gives her a look: Who are you? ... But obliges.
JANE
It’s every federal law that
discriminates on the basis of sex.
We’re looking them all up.
Martin exhales: The scope of it.
MARTIN
Pass me one of those volumes.
Ruth smiles as Martin joins the unorthodox team at the table.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
How in the world did they manage
all this?
INT. GRISWOLD’S SUBURBAN HOME - LIBRARY - MAGIC HOUR
A formal room. Out the window, the first hints of spring.
(CONTINUED)

79

James Bozarth stands before A PULL-DOWN SCREEN in a formal,
wood-panelled “library.” Amidst a team of young DOJ LAWYERS.
PROJECTED ON SCREEN: JUDGE DAUGHERTY (57, close-cropped hair
and perfect posture).
OFF TO THE SIDE: Harriet Griswold (67 now and in a
wheelchair) is supervising a MAID preparing tea service.
ON A COUCH before Bozarth are Griswold and Brown.
BROWN
So you’re confident Daugherty will
see it our way.
BOZARTH
Based on reading all of his
opinions. Yes. And so will
Holloway.
Bozarth uses his clicker. JUDGE HOLLOWAY (48, a kindly smile)
appears on the screen.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
But the final judge, Doyle...
Bozarth puts up DOYLE’s picture (60, a shock of white hair).
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
He’s a tougher nut to crack.
Griswold shoots Brown a warning look.
GRISWOLD
That’s unacceptable.
BROWN
We need an unanimous verdict out of
the Tenth Circuit, James.
GRISWOLD
I don’t intend to risk so-called
gender discrimination going before
the Supreme Court.
BOZARTH
Yes... Yes, sir. I understand.
Harriet can see he’s nervous.

And sympathizes...

HARRIET GRISWOLD
What makes this judge so difficult?

(CONTINUED)

80

BOZARTH
He’s a civil rights crusader,
ma’am. Two years ago he ordered
Denver to bus black students to
white schools. There was arson,
protests, demands for him to quit
the bench. But even after someone
threw a bomb at his house, Doyle
wouldn’t budge.
GRISWOLD
In that case he was enforcing the
law. The Ginsburgs are asking him
to MAKE law. We need to drive home
the difference.
Brown considerd Griswold’s challenge... And offers a path:
BROWN
(to Bozarth)
Paint the judges a picture of the
America that will exist if they
rule the wrong way. Children
running home from school to find...
No one’s there. Mommy’s at the
office. Or on a factory floor.
GRISWOLD
That’s very good, Ernie. If a man
and woman vie for the same job, she
can work for less. What is a man
without a paycheck to take care of
his family?
BROWN
What woman would want him?
BOZARTH
(going with their flow)
Wages go down. Divorce rates soar.
Society unravels.
BROWN
Exactly! The other side wants this
to be about the Equal Protection
Principle. YOU need to show the
court that what’s really at stake
is the American family.
GRISWOLD
What the judges are deciding is
what kind of country, what kind of
society, they want their children
and grandchildren to grow up in.

80A

INT. GRISWOLD’S SUBURBAN HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Harriet’s atop the bed. Her withered legs sprawled limply
across Griswold’s lap. He’s massaging them.
She watches him for a beat...
HARRIET GRISWOLD
Erwin. Did you ever take a
caregiver deduction on our taxes?
GRISWOLD
I take whatever deductions the law
says we’re entitled to.
He can see in her look, she’s not satisfied with his answer.

(CONTINUED)

81

Harriet...

GRISWOLD (CONT’D)

HARRIET GRISWOLD
Are you sure you’re doing the right
thing in this case?
GRISWOLD
What exactly are you concerned
about?
HARRIET GRISWOLD
I don’t doubt the law is on your
side. But I feel sorry for this
Moritz. Can you imagine coping with
the burden of my polio if-GRISWOLD
You have NEVER been a burden to me.
You have been so productive all
your life.
HARRIET GRISWOLD
But I’ve always had help.
He knows it. Griswold considers her. After a long beat...
GRISWOLD
I can’t imagine how Charles Moritz
manages. It must take remarkable
fortitude. Really. ... But I don’t
get to indulge in sentiment. I took
an oath to protect the constitution
because it protects the country. I
can’t let these Ginsburgs attack it
piece-by-piece.
HARRIET GRISWOLD
I don’t envy you.
He smiles. And goes back to rubbing her legs.
GRISWOLD
You should. I’m a very lucky man.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - NIGHT
Martin, in his usual golf shirt and French apron, is cooking
IN THE KITCHEN.
James is drawing dinosaurs on THE COUNTER BETWEEN THE KITCHEN
AND DINING ROOM.

82

IN THE DINING ROOM: Ruth paces. Notes in hand. Practicing...
RUTH
(to herself)
Sex and race are both unalterable
biological traits...
She’s forgetting something. She checks her notes: Of course.
IN THE KITCHEN: Martin lifts a flambé pan warming on the
stove. And... WHOOSH! He ignites the Calvados inside.
JAMES
(running into the kitchen)
Whoa! Cool!
Martin pours the flaming liquor over a pan of chicken livers.
THE DOORBELL RINGS. As Ruth goes to answer it, Jane finds
her...
JANE
Mom. Can I be on the jury?
RUTH
There is no jury in federal appeals
court. No witnesses, no evidence.
... It’s just you and the judges.
She looks to Jane and smiles. Then opens THE FRONT DOOR to
GERALD GUNTHER (44). He’s genial, with graying hair and a
bald crown. He wears a collared shirt and gray sweater. Ruth
is delighted to see him.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Gerry. Jane, you remember my old
professor, Gerald Gunther.
He has a vaguely European accent. As Ruth takes his coat:
GUNTHER
A little specificity, Mrs.
Ginsburg. Former professor.
(to Jane)
Look at you. All grown up.
Jane smiles. As he follows them into the DINING ROOM:
GUNTHER (CONT’D)
Hello, James.

Hi.

JAMES

JANE
What do you think of our courtroom?
The place has been transformed into a rough facsimile of a
courtroom. The table serves as a judges’ bench. A dictionary
lectern, the lawyer’s podium.
GUNTHER
All it’s missing is Justice holding
her scales. So, who did Mel find to
be the third judge?
RUTH
(intimidated)
Pauli Murray.
GUNTHER
He’s not making it easy for you.
JANE
Who’s Pauli Murray?
GUNTHER
Thurgood Marshall himself called
Pauli’s writings the Bible of the
Civil Rights Movement.
Martin enters, wielding a meat tenderizer.
MARTIN
Gerry. I come bearing your gavel.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - LATER
Beneath a drawing (by James) of Justice, the moot-court
judges sit behind the dining room table.
Laid out on the table: sliced baguette, apple, vegetables.
And a heaping, garnished platter of chicken liver paté.
Gerry BANGS his meat tenderizer gavel.
Mel is to his left. Biting into a baguette slice topped with
paté, he’s impressed.
To Gerry’s right is PAULI MURRAY (61) -- a petite, black
woman with short hair in tight curls and round glasses. Her
grin extenuated by joyous laugh lines.
Martin watches from the couch. With Jane.

84

GUNTHER
Counsel for the appellant, you may
proceed. Again.
Ruth, at the lectern, takes a breath. As the “judges”
continue to snack.
RUTH
Your honors and may it please the
court. Section 214 of the tax code
covers employed single women who
care for their dependents. But
excludes Charles Moritz, a bachelor
providing-PAULI
My wife stays home to raise our
children. You’re saying she’s
oppressed?
RUTH
No Judge. But as a man, you-MEL
Stop. Stop.
(he finishes chewing)
Never make it about the judge.
GUNTHER
You don’t think the judge knows
he’s a man?
MEL
I don’t think she needs to put him
on the defensive about it.
PAULI
In Brown, we put it out there
without apology: This. Is. Wrong.
MEL
Well, no offense, but Ruth doesn’t
exactly have Thurgood
Marshall’s......
Balls?
Gravitas.

PAULI

Nothing resolved, the conversation’s over. Ruth shuffles her
papers to cover her frustration. Jane gives Martin a worried
look. His smile says “Don’t worry.”

RUTH
Should I start again?
Ya think?

MEL

GUNTHER
Whenever you’re ready.
RUTH
Your honors and may it please the
court. Section 214 of the tax code

care for their dependents. But
excludes Charles Moritz, a bachelor
providing the same care. There is
no rational basis for-GUNTHER
Why isn’t it rational? Men go out.

Why shouldn’t men be nurses? If
women want to fight fires-MEL
What about pilots?
RUTH
Again if women-MEL
(chewing)
Judges?
Why not?

RUTH

MEL
Generals? CEOs? What about garbage
men? You wanna be a garbage man?
RUTH
And men should be teachers or raise

MEL
No. Wrong. Wrong. You’re
screwing it up!

RUTH (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
People should be able to
pursue their passions and--

She holds up the Government’s APPENDIX E:
RUTH (CONT’D)
Have you seen the appendix attached
to their brief? Laws written by men
who think we’re privileged to be
excused from men’s obligations.
It’s not a privilege. It’s a cage.
These laws are the bars.
As they all fall silent. Ruth realizes she’s blown it. Mel
eyes her smugly...

87

MEL
(smearing paté onto bread)
And you’re going to take on all of
them at once, is that it?
RUTH
You asked the questions.
MEL
(harshly)
That doesn’t mean you answer them,
Ruth. You’re making the
government’s case for them.
Jane’s surprised, and angered, by his tone.
MEL (CONT’D)
Either you make this case about one
man, or you lose. Because to the
judges, you’re not talking about
women in the abstract. You’re
talking about their wives. At home.
Baking briskets.
JANE
You braise a brisket. You don’t
bake it.
Mel shoots her a look. As Martin chuckles.
GUNTHER
Perhaps that’s enough, Mel.
MEL
No. I don’t think it is, Gerry.
(to Ruth)
Since you were a girl, you’ve been
pretty and smart as a whip. But
you’re coming off as some bitter,
unlikable shrew I don’t recognize.
And let me tell you: if that’s who
shows up in Denver, Ruth, you’ll
blow it. And would it kill you to
smile?
RUTH
That’s your sage advice: ignore the
judges and smile?
Mel bites into the bread. With his mouth full:
MEL
But I will say your paté is the
best I’ve ever tasted.

Ruth’s look says, Choke on it.
Martin rises and approaches Ruth. Gently. Supportive.
An excellent teacher, he talks just to her...
MARTIN
You could evade.
(modelling)
“Do you think women should be
firefighters?” ... I’ve never
considered it. Because my client
isn’t a firefighter.
Jane’s watching. Martin’s “teaching” Ruth, but without
condescension. Wanting only her success. Ruth listens. With
trust and affection. It’s intimate... And Jane is affected.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Or refocus. With respect, Judge.
This case isn’t about firemen; it’s
about taxpayers. And there is
nothing inherently masculine about
paying taxes.
Mel looks up. That’s not bad. He shares a look with Gunther
and Pauli.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Or crack a joke. Your honor, no one
who’s raised children could be
intimidated by a burning building.
Then lead them back to your case.
Ruth looks to Martin: Thank you.
MEL
Marty. You should do the oral
argument.
It lands like a grenade...
MARTIN
No. No way. I was just... Ruth is
the expert in gender law.
GUNTHER
At least half this case is tax.
MEL
The most important thing is that
Charles Moritz wins.
MARTIN
I said no. Drop it, Mel.

(CONTINUED)

89

A beat of silence. As Ruth crumbles...
PAULI
They could split the time. Martin
goes first, focuses the argument on
tax. Then Ruth steps in to talk
about gender.
Her tone is so even. Her solution, so reasonable. Her affect,
so definitive. It’s clear they agree.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - LATER
The ‘Judges’ are getting ready to leave. As Ruth chats with
Gunther and Pauli, Martin sidles up to Mel. Quietly. Angrily.
MARTIN
There is no aspect of the law at
which Ruth Ginsburg can be bested.
MEL
Objection noted, counselor. She’s
still arguing half.
MARTIN
I don’t know how things work at the
ACLU. But if anyone at my firm
couldn’t see that, he’d be fired.
MEL
She’s written a revolutionary
argument. But brief writing is an
academic’s job. Oral arguments
require a lawyer who commands a
judge’s respect. A real appellate
lawyer.
Mel turns away -- suddenly cheerful. Leaving Martin to stew.
MEL (CONT’D)
Well, I think this was a very
productive exercise. I have to get
to a fundraiser. Pauli. Gerry. Are
you headed downtown?
They all leave...
When the door closes, Martin looks to Ruth. And waits for her
to speak first...
RUTH
You have such a light touch. It’s
effortless for you, isn’t it?

MARTIN
Mel was goading you. He wanted you
to feel overwhelmed.

RUTH
Of course he was. He’s a relentless
prick. But that doesn’t change the
fact that I’m not ready.
MARTIN
But that’s not your fault. You’ve
never even done this before.
RUTH
Is that what I’m supposed to tell
our client when I blow it in court?
She’s already walking away:

Where are you going?
RUTH
To figure out every question those
judges can possibly ask me. I’m
going to have answers for all of
them.

Mel gestures for Ruth to sit beside Allen. Who half-rises,
and offers a handshake:
ALLEN DERR

Mel SHUSHES him. As Ruth sits -- unsure what’s going on.

to do.
ALLEN DERR
Mel says you know this area of the
law better than anyone.
MEL
You’re our secret weapon, Ruth.
Ruth is shocked... Honored... Amazed:
RUTH
You want me...? In the Supreme
Court?
Mel can see she thinks she’s being asked to argue the case:
MEL
I assured Allen you’d be eager to
help him write his brief.
She swallows her disappointment.
MEL (CONT’D)
You can basically just take the
Moritz brief and change the
pronouns around, isn’t that right?
RUTH
It’s a bit more involved than that.
MEL
I was kidding. We’ll get working
right away.
(rising)
Allen. Enjoy the city. You should
catch a show.
ALLEN DERR
Oh! Well, thank you.
MEL
Kiki and I have some other things
to discuss.
ALLEN DERR
Of course! I’ll be out of your way.
(gathering his belongings)
It was a pleasure, Ruth -- or Kiki!
Goodbye, Mel. ...... Bye. Oh!
(he remembers his hat)
Bye.
(CONTINUED)

93

And he’s gone. Mel’s smile drops.
MEL
What a schmuck.
RUTH
Let me argue Reed in Court.
MEL
Give me a break, Ruth.
RUTH
I am no less experienced in Federal
Court than Allen Derr. If you’re
gonna use MY arguments-MEL
He’s been Sally Reed’s lawyer for
three years. She trusts him. She
wouldn’t even let ME plead the
case. Now would you just listen for
a second?
She does.
MEL (CONT’D)
Ernie Brown called earlier. In
light of Reed going to the Supreme
Court, the government is offering
to settle Moritz’s case for a
dollar.
RUTH
(getting it)
Reed ups the profile of our case.
They’re getting nervous.
MEL
I told him to expect you in D.C. on
Monday to sign the paperwork.
RUTH
Why would you--? Charlie won’t want
to settle.
MEL
Convince him.
RUTH
I will not. First you took half the
argument away from me...

(CONTINUED)

94

MEL
Nobody took anything from you,
Ruth. You weren’t robbed in the
night. I gave you this opportunity
for the good of the cause...
MEL (CONT’D)
...not for your own personal
glory.

RUTH
You think you gave this to
me?!

MEL
In fact I did. Jesus Ruth, get your
emotions in check.
You first.

RUTH

They stay that way. Eye to eye. Until...
MEL
Allen’s going to argue in the
Supreme Court that times have
changed. We can’t afford the 10th
Circuit ruling that they haven’t.
RUTH
Nothing would strengthen the
argument more than the Appeals
Court deciding for Charlie.
MEL
Yes. That would be very nice. But
here in the real world-RUTH
You think I can’t be persuasive.
MEL
Ruth, I’ve never been more certain
of anything in my life.
RUTH
You don’t get to tell me when to
quit.
MEL
You asked for my support. I put my
neck out for you. And you couldn’t
even get through a moot court
without embarrassing yourself.
You’ll lose Ruth! And when you do,
it’ll set back the women’s movement
by a decade or more.

MEL (CONT'D)
We’re dodging a bullet here. Are
you really the only one who can’t
see that?
A strained and silent beat. Before...
Mel pulls a stack of documents from his desk drawer.
MEL (CONT’D)
These are Allen’s briefs from his
previous appeals. Tie them into the
framework of the Moritz brief. I’ll
review it when you’re done.
Eyeing him coldly, Ruth doesn’t move.
MEL (CONT’D)
It’s a Supreme Court brief. .... I
can assign it to someone else, if
that’s what you’d prefer.
She hesitates. Then takes them from the desk. As she leaves:
MEL (CONT’D)
And Ruth, the sooner you call
Charlie the better.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
As Ruth pours coffee, Martin is watching her.
RUTH
You know I had this idea...
She trails off.
MARTIN
What was it?
RUTH
It doesn’t matter. ... Thank you
for working so hard on this. I know
you had paying clients to worry
about, too.
MARTIN
What were you going to say?
She hesitates a beat. Then admits it -- the scope of her
ambition:

RUTH
We could have taken Appendix E from
the Government’s brief, that entire
comprehensive list of laws that
differentiate between the sexes,
and turn it into our own hit list.

RUTH (CONT'D)
We could have started a special
project at the ACLU to go after
those laws one-by-one -- in the
legislature, in the courts. Until
women and men were genuinely equal
under the law.
She laughs at her own naiveté.
RUTH (CONT’D)
... And I’ve been running around
claiming things have changed.
She leaves. OFF MARTIN: Who doesn’t know how to help her.
INT. GINSBURG APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER
At her desk. OPERA on the radio. Her mother’s portrait
watching her. Ruth takes a long, slow sip of coffee.
Then gets to work taking down the note cards and clippings
still tacked to the wall... One by one.
Jane approaches. But hesitates in the doorway. Watching...
JANE
Daddy told me about the case. Why’s
Mr. Wulf being such a douchebag?
Ruth’s displeased with the language. But lets it go.
RUTH
He thinks I’m going to lose.
JANE
Seriously? I can tell you from
experience: no way, Jose.
RUTH
He didn’t exactly give me a choice.
Jane considers is...
JANE
So do you want help taking apart
your life’s work, or is that
something you’d rather do alone?
They share a look -- and really SEE each other.
RUTH
I know that this case... That I
disrupted our lives. I’m sorry.

JANE
For what? Doing your job? That’s
how men WANT us to feel. ... Mom,

INTERCUT:
INT. MORITZ’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Moritz cradles the phone to his ear with his shoulder. He’s
cleaning up His Mother’s lunch off the television tray.
MORITZ
So you did it? ... We won. Ruth.
Congratulations. ... And they’ll
say it, right? That I’m not a
cheater. That the law is unfair.
RUTH
No, Charlie. That’s the point. They
don’t want to... They will never
say that. A judge has to.
MORITZ
But if they don’t say it, Ruth...
how have I gotten justice?
RUTH
You get the money.
Moritz considers this. And it doesn’t sit right.
MORITZ
What about everyone else? When you
came to see me, you said-Ruth knows Jane is listening, and is sad to say it, but...
RUTH
That’s for another day.
MORITZ
But could we win?
RUTH
We could.
(looking at Jane)
And the impact would last
generations. But in the end, you
may walk away with nothing. ...
Charlie. The ACLU feels it’s for
the best if you take the offer.

MORITZ
... But you’re my lawyer, Ruth.
What do you think?
Off Ruth: with a decision to make.

INT. DOJ - BROWN’S OFFICE - DAY
Brown opens the door to Ruth. He takes her hand. Warmly.
She’s mildly surprised to see Griswold behind him.
Ruth.

BROWN

RUTH
Hello, Professor Brown. Dean
Griswold.
GRISWOLD
(as they shake hands)
Mrs. Ginsburg. I’m pleased you
found a use for your Harvard
Education.
RUTH
Oh, no. What I’m doing, I learned
at Columbia.
He sizes her up for an awkward beat... Until Brown steps in.
BROWN
Ruth was always my most thoroughly
prepared student. So much to prove.
These days the girls are as
hopeless as the men.
(offering her a seat)
How’s little Jane?
RUTH
Not so little. And we have another.
James.
BROWN
They must keep you busy.
RUTH
Yes. Both of us.

GRISWOLD
Ernie has your paperwork ready.
RUTH
My client was very excited about
your offer.
GRISWOLD
Good. Good.
RUTH
He did, however, have some
conditions.
BROWN
Conditions...? What kind of...?
RUTH
First of all. He’d like you to
forgive a hundred percent of the
money. None of this one dollar
business.
BROWN
Ha. Well... I’m sure we can find a
way to arrange that.
RUTH
And he’d like the government to
concede that he did nothing wrong.
And to enter into the court record
that Section 214 of the Tax Code
discriminates on the basis of sex.
And is therefore unconstitutional.
Griswold and Brown’s smiles drop.
GRISWOLD
I can’t agree to that. And you know
it.
BROWN
Does Mel Wulf know about this?
It’s in Ruth’s look: she’s completely in control. Brown
glances to Griswold -- who’s eyeing Ruth coldly.
BROWN (CONT’D)

We’ll see you in court.

IT’S THE SAME SCENE THAT OPENED THE MOVIE:
Concealer, lipstick, mascara on the counter. RUTH BADER
GINSBURG (36) is applying blush. When she’s finished, she
considers her reflection. She puts on A GOLD, SUNBURST PIN.

EXT. 10TH CIRCUIT COURTHOUSE - FRONT STEPS - DAY
Early fall. A Denver Cab parks across the street from the

Ruth stares at the court. Frozen. Awed. ... Martin sees her:
MARTIN
You’re ready for this. You’ve been
ready for as long as I’ve known
you. Just let the judges see the
Ruth Ginsburg I know.
As they cross the street, a black town car pulls up. And DOJ
Lawyers step out. With Bozarth and Brown. ... Brown spies
Martin and approaches. As Ruth continues up the stairs.
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Professor Brown.
Brown clasps Martin by the hand. Another hand on his

It’s good to see you Marty.
He looks over at Ruth -- still collecting herself...

She’s getting psyched up.

Ah...

After you.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
Ruth, Jane and Mel enter between gray, marble pillars. A
chandelier casts the JUDGE’S BENCH in warm light. Over it, a
clock and an adage: Reason is the Soul of All Law.
MEL
(skeptically)
Well... Here we are.
A small CROWD loiters amid the pews IN THE GALLERY. From
among them, Moritz approaches.
Charlie.

RUTH

MORITZ
Good morning.
(to Mel)
Mr. Ginsburg?
MEL
Uh... Um. No. Mel Wulf. ACLU.
Jane chuckles. As Martin arrives.
MARTIN
Mr. Moritz, that’s me. I’m Mr. Ruth
Bader Ginsburg. It’s nice to
finally meet you.
They shake. Moritz looks warily toward Bozarth and Brown at
THE APPELLEE’S TABLE. As the Court Clerk puffs his chest.
COURT CLERK
All rise. The United States Court
of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is
now in session. Judges Doyle,
Holloway, and Daugherty presiding.
Martin and Ruth find their place at the APPELLANT’S TABLE.
The Judges enter from behind the velvet curtain beyond THE
JUDGES’ BENCH. Each takes a seat behind his name plate.
In THE GALLERY, Mel and Jane flank Moritz. Jane reminds him
to remain standing.
Be seated.

JUDGE HOLLOWAY

Martin and Ruth share a glance as they sit. At THE APPELLEE’S
TABLE across the aisle, Brown catches Bozarth eyeing them.

(CONTINUED)

103

BROWN
You have a century of case law on
your side. Just do your job.
Holloway flips through a couple papers on his desk.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
The first case is docket number 711127. Charles Moritz v Commissioner
of Internal Revenue. Each side will
have 30 minutes to present. When
two minutes remain, the Court Clerk
will rise to give warning. When
your time is up, he will sit.
He looks over at Martin and Ruth, seated together before him.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY (CONT’D)
Counsel for the appellant. Mr.
Ginsburg, you may proceed.
It begins.
Martin and Ruth look to one another. Then Martin takes his
place AT THE LECTERN, checking the time on the clock
overhead. 9:00 AM.
IN THE GALLERY, Moritz sits taller. Smiles nervously to Jane.
MARTIN
Your Honors and may it please the
court. We’re going to demonstrate
that Section 214 of the tax code
discriminates against our client -Charles Moritz -- because he is a
man.
FROM THE BENCH the Judges settle in. Interested. And engaged.
INT. COURTROOM - 9:13 AM
ON THE BENCH, Judge Holloway remains polite. Thoughtful.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Congress assumed that a caregiver
is most likely a woman. Is that so
unreasonable?
MARTIN
If the law said all caregivers can
claim a deduction.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

104

MARTIN (CONT'D)
And in the back of their minds the
authors thought, well, this will
only apply to women, that would be
an assumption. But they did more
than that, Judge. They explicitly
listed who counts as a caregiver.
JUDGE DOYLE
As is their prerogative.
MARTIN
I doubt you’d turn a blind eye if
the code said that only white
caregivers-JUDGE DOYLE
That’s hardly the same thing.
Martin checks the clock. 9:14:40
MARTIN
Respectfully we disagree. But I’ll
turn it over to my co-counsel to
address the constitutional-Ruth begins to get up.
JUDGE DAUGHERTY
You’re telling us that race and
gender are the same?
Ruth is stuck, mid-rise. Watching Daugherty.
MARTIN
Your honor, my co-counsel-JUDGE DAUGHTERTY
Yes. Yes. We’ll get to her in a
minute. But I’d appreciate an
answer to my question.
Ruth sinks back into her seat. And Martin is caught looking
back and forth between her and Daugherty. She urges him on
with her eyes: Get out of there.

(CONTINUED)

105

JUDGE DAUGHERTY
In order for a law to discriminate,
it must distinguish between groups
arbitrarily. Is that correct?
MARTIN
Again. Your Honor. My co-counsel-JUDGE DAUGHERTY
Mister Ginsburg. I have asked you.
Martin looks to Ruth. An apology. He has no choice...
MARTIN
It must be arbitrary. Yes. And this
law is. Mr. Moritz is a man who has
never been married. That may
suggest he is less likely to have
child-care responsibilities. But
not parent-care responsibilities.
Had he been a woman-Judge Doyle cocks a skeptical eyebrow.
JUDGE DOYLE
And to your mind, classifications
of this sort must always be
discriminatory?
AT APPELLEE’S TABLE, Brown leans close to Bozarth.
BROWN
There’s some help. He’s asking him
to make a broad categorical claim.
MARTIN
I can’t speak to always, Judge
Doyle. We can only speak of this
man. In this case.
IN THE GALLERY, Mel lets out a breath. Martin nailed it.
Very well.

JUDGE DOYLE

He takes a note on the brief before him. As Martin moves away
from the LECTERN.
JUDGE DOYLE (CONT’D)
Then speak of him.
The COURTROOM chuckles. Especially Brown. In the ruckus,
Martin turns to check on Ruth. She’s staring at her notes.

(CONTINUED)

106

MARTIN
Again. The distinction between Mr.
Moritz and other caregivers is, in
Judge Daugherty’s words, arbitrary.
(hurriedly)
I cede the remainder of the time to
my co-counsel.
Ruth looks up. Realizing she’s on. As Martin gathers his
papers and flees the LECTERN.
As he passes, he eyes Ruth: What could I do? Martin sits at
the APPELLANT’S TABLE. As Ruth approaches the lectern.
FROM THE BENCH, the Judges eye her skeptically.
She adjusts the microphone down. To Doyle’s amusement.
RUTH
Your Honors...
She watches them. Looking down on her. And falls silent. She
cannot see Martin urging her on with his eyes.
IN THE GALLERY, Mel sits forward. Nervous. Moritz notices.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Whenever you’re ready, Professor
Ginsburg.
RUTH
... Your Honors and may it please
the court. Section 214 denies Mr.
Moritz a caregiver tax deduction
available to similarly situated
women who-JUDGE HOLLOWAY
We’ve been through all that. Mrs.
Ginsburg. You are aware that the
government has three co-equal
branches?
She watches. Expecting him to continue.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY (CONT’D)
Mrs. Ginsburg?
It dawns on her. He actually expects an answer.
RUTH
Yes. Of course, Judge.

(CONTINUED)

107

JUDGE HOLLOWAY
And that it is the Congress’s role
to write law.
RUTH
(sharply)
Your Honor, I understand how
government works.
Holloway lifts his eyebrows, unaccustomed to being addressed
impatiently.
IN THE GALLERY:
MEL
(to himself)
Take it easy, Ruth.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Well sometimes a law -- even a good
law, even a law that is legal under
the constitution -- may not be good
for every individual it affects.
JUDGE DOYLE
I have a question. If I understand
correctly, you’re concerned about
men and women being pigeon-holed
into certain roles based on gender.
RUTH
Yes. That’s correct. Because -JUDGE DOYLE
Excuse me. That wasn’t my question.
(Ruth grimaces)
It strikes me that the caregiver
deduction does the opposite. It
helps women be able to work outside
the home. Isn’t that a good thing?
RUTH
But the law assumes it must be
women who are supposed to stay at
home in the first place.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
That’s the case in every family I
know.
JUDGE DOYLE
So it’s the assumption that’s the
problem?

(CONTINUED)

108

JUDGE DAUGHERTY
Then when can a law differentiate
on the basis of sex? Never?
Ruth stares up at Daugherty for a beat. Catching up.
IN THE GALLERY: Moritz glances at Jane biting her fingernail
nervously. Then back at Ruth.
RUTH
When the classification is
rationally related to the law.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Keeping women out of combat, for
example.
RUTH
I’m not sure whether I agree with
that example, but-IN THE GALLERY: Mel closes his eyes. Exasperated.
JUDGE DAUGHERTY
So you think women belong on the
front lines now, too?
RUTH
No. That’s not what...
Ruth takes a deep breath. Composing herself.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Gender. Like Race. Is a biological,
unalterable trait. There is nothing
that women are inherently better at
than men. Nor vice versa.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Growing a beard?
The GALLERY laughs. And Holloway appreciates the attention.
As Ruth grows visually frustrated.
RUTH
That isn’t-Lactation.

JUDGE DAUGHERTY

More laughter. AT THE APPELLEE’S TABLE: Brown and Bozarth
share a satisfied grin.

109

RUTH
(bursting)
No thinking person can possibly
believe Charles Moritz’s gender
relates to his ability to-Her hand strikes the microphone. And it SQUEALS. Leaving the
courtroom dauntingly quiet in the wake of her outburst.
IN THE GALLERY: Mel drops his head. Defeated.
AT THE APPELLANT’S TABLE: Even Martin looks away.
Ruth knows she’s blown it.
JUDGE DOYLE
Why can’t we? Mrs. Ginsburg?
Staring at the floor, she doesn’t answer.
JUDGE DOYLE (CONT’D)
In most households, aren’t women
the primary caregivers? Aren’t men
the breadwinners? ... Aren’t they?
She readjusts the microphone.
RUTH
Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE DOYLE
Doesn’t that reality suggest that
it’s the natural order of things?
She looks to Martin. Who watches her with deep and tender
sadness in his eyes.
RUTH
Respectfully. Your Honors. I’d like
to reserve the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.
Slowly. She gathers her papers. And returns to the
APPELLANT’S TABLE. Daugherty tosses up his arms.
As Ruth sits, Martin leans toward her.
MARTIN
(whispering)
Good move. It’s not over yet.
IN THE GALLERY: Moritz turns to Mel.

(CONTINUED)

110

MORITZ
I don’t think I followed all that.
How are we doing?
Mel eyes him askance. Are you serious? He mimes an explosion.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Mr. Bozarth for the appellee. You
may proceed.
AT THE APPELLEE’S TABLE:
BROWN
Don’t let them forget what this
case is really about, and you’ll be
fine.
Bozarth understands. He steps to the LECTERN. 9:27.
JUDGE DAUGHERTY
Ah. Bozarth. The master of
citations.
BOZARTH
That’s what my family calls me too,
Judge.
Daugherty chuckles.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
Your Honors and may it please the
court. Congress created this tax
deduction to help caregivers go out
and work. Caregivers. Folks that,
if they weren’t working, would stay
home.
Martin focuses his attention on Ruth. Eyes her steadily. As
she stares ahead. Maintaining her composure.
IN THE GALLERY: Moritz listens intently. One thing about him:
he could be any man.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
Are we meant to believe that this
man would have the skills or the...
caregiver’s instinct to do that?
JUDGE DOYLE
Why can’t we believe that? Why does
an unwed woman have that instinct,
but not an unwed man? Or a WIDOWER
for that matter?!

(CONTINUED)

111

BOZARTH
Widowers don’t choose to be
caregivers, Judge Doyle. It’s
thrust upon them. As for women...
It doesn’t take a legal treatise to
prove what a hundred thousand years
of human history makes clear.
Ruth -- calmly, quietly -- slides her notes across the table
to Martin. ... A flash of relief, as Martin begins to review
them. Preparing for rebuttal.
JUDGE DOYLE
And Congress can write the tax code
to enforce this... natural law?
BOZARTH
Congress can write any tax code it
wants. All I’m saying, Judge, is
that -- given the natural order of
things -- Mr. Moritz has not
suffered as a result. But the
COUNTRY will suffer, if the court
doesn’t find for the appellee.
AT THE APPELLEE’S TABLE: Brown is impressed by his protege.
INT. COURTROOM - 9:53
STILL AT THE LECTERN: Bozarth is winding down.
BOZARTH
Y’honors, I’m certain there isn’t a
man amongst us who wouldn’t try to
ease his wife’s burdens.
AT THE APPELLANT’S TABLE: Martin is working on Ruth’s notes.
Drawing arrows, jotting down reminders.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
So I don’t see how we can judge
negatively the members of Congress
who would do the same. And I’m not
alone in that. There is a long and
honorable tradition in the Courts
of supporting laws like this one.
The Court Clerk rises. 9:54.
IN THE GALLERY: It’s clear on Mel’s face: the damage is done.

(CONTINUED)

112

BOZARTH (CONT’D)
I for one would rather see my
government err on the side of
caring too much, of trying too hard
to help the ladies of this country.
Rather than be indifferent to their
unique burdens. Now maybe Mr.
Moritz disagrees. Or maybe he
simply doesn’t like paying taxes.
IN THE GALLERY: Moritz looks small. And defeated.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
Personally, I don’t believe that.
AT THE LECTERN: Bozarth knows he has the Judges’ attention.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
I believe Charles Moritz is a
victim. Not of his government. But
of lawyers who used his case to
achieve their own ends...
Ruth looks up at him -- finding him staring at her.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
Radical. Social. Change.
He lets it sink in. Lets his head nod for emphasis.
BOZARTH (CONT’D)
We rest our case on our briefs and
argument, and ask that the Court
uphold the Tax Court’s decision.
9:55. The Clerk is still standing.
An awed silence follows him. Ruth watches as he takes his
seat at the APPELLEE’S TABLE. Brown pats him on the back.
AT THE APPELLANT’S TABLE: Martin jots a last note to himself.
As Ruth watches Bozarth and Brown. Her mind reeling.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Counsel for the appellant. You have
four minutes for rebuttal.
Ruth looks up toward the BENCH. And sees where the Judges are
looking: all eyes are on Martin. He rises. Gathering his
papers.
She looks across the aisle. At the APPELLEE’S TABLE: like
he’s still her professor, like she’s still some presumptuous
student - Brown stares at her over the frames of his glasses.
(CONTINUED)

113

And she looks back INTO THE GALLERY, where Mel’s
rocking nervously.
Ruth grabs Martin’s arm. He looks down at her. An enduring
glance, as she tightens her grip and pulls him back down.
IN THE GALLERY: Mel sees it. And knows they’re screwed.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Counsel for the appellant?
Martin considers Ruth’s intensity... And grins. THIS is the
woman he married. He settles into his chair. Gives a nod...
Counselor.

MARTIN

Leaving her notes behind, Ruth approaches THE LECTERN. The
Judges share a look.
RUTH
Radical social change.
She half-laughs at it. And looks up to the Judges.
RUTH (CONT’D)
When I was in law school... there
was no women’s bathroom.
A murmur of LAUGHTER from the gallery. ON THE BENCH: Doyle
smiles. Holloway and Daugherty don’t know where she’s going.
RUTH (CONT’D)
It’s amazing to me now, but we
never complained. Not because we
were timid. We were just astounded
that we were in law school at all.
AT THE APPELLEE’S TABLE: Bozarth turns away dismissively toward Brown. Surprised to find him listening intently.
RUTH (CONT’D)
A hundred years ago, Myra Bradwell
wanted to be a lawyer. She had
fulfilled the requirements for the
Illinois bar, but wasn’t allowed to
practice because she was a woman.
An injustice she asked the Supreme
Court to correct. Illinois was so
confident of victory, they didn’t
even send a lawyer to argue their
side. They were right. She lost.

(CONTINUED)

114

IN THE GALLERY: Mel leans forward. This is a different Ruth.
She’s confident. Compelling. She’s finally connecting.
RUTH (CONT’D)
That was the first time someone
went to court to challenge his or
her prescribed gender role. A
hundred years ago. Radical social
change?
She clutches the lectern.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Sixty-five years ago. When women in
Oregon wanted to work overtime, and
make more money, as men could. The
Court looked to the precedent in
Bradwell. And said no. And then
there were two precedents. Then
three. Then four. And on. And on.
You can draw a direct line from
Myra Bradwell to Gwendolyn Hoyt told ten years ago she was not
entitled to a jury of her peers.
She looks the Judges directly in the eyes.
RUTH (CONT’D)
That is the legacy the Government
asks you to uphold today. You are
being urged to protect the culture
and traditions and morality of an
America that no longer exists.
For Judge Holloway, it’s a sobering thought.
RUTH (CONT’D)
A generation ago, my students would
have been arrested for indecency
wearing the clothes that they do.
THE GALLERY laughs. Including Jane and Moritz.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Sixty-five years ago, it would have
been unimaginable that my daughter
would aspire to a career. And a
hundred years ago. I would not have
had the right to stand before you.
She presses her fingers into the lectern for emphasis...

(CONTINUED)

115

RUTH (CONT’D)
We are not asking you to change the
country. That’s already happened
without any Court’s permission. We
are asking you to protect the right
of the country to change.
9:58. The Clerk Rises. Ruth considers him.
IN THE GALLERY:

(to himself)
Get to the remedy. The remedy.
RUTH
There are a hundred and seventyeight federal laws that
differentiate on the basis of sex.
Count them. The Government did the
favor of compiling them for you.
And while you’re at it, I urge you
to read them. They are obstacles to
our children’s aspirations.
JUDGE DOYLE
You’re asking us to overturn nearly
a century of precedent.
She looks him dead in the eye. Without hesitation.
RUTH
I’m asking you to set a new
precedent. As courts have done
before when the law is outdated.
It’s in Martin’s reaction -- that was a good response.
JUDGE DOYLE
But in those cases the courts had a
clear constitutional handle.

JUDGE DOYLE (CONT'D)
The word ‘woman’ doesn’t appear
even once in the U.S. Constitution.
RUTH
Nor does the word ‘freedom.’ Your
honor.
Doyle looks down on her for a long time. And she returns his
gaze -- unflinchingly. Until he leans back. A slight nod.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Our sons and daughters are barred
by law from opportunities based on
assumptions about their abilities.
How will they ever disprove these
assumptions, if laws like Section
214 are allowed to stand?
FROM THE APPELLANT’S TABLE Martin watches the Clerk, watching
the clock. 9:59:30.
RUTH (CONT’D)
That is why we must take these laws
on. One-by-one. For as long as it
takes. For their sakes.
IN THE GALLERY: Jane smiles. Mel is anxious: C’mon. C’mon.
RUTH (CONT’D)
And you have the power to set the
precedent that will get us started.
You can right this wrong, by-The Clerk sits. 10:00. And Ruth watches him. Her jaw
clenched. Willing him to stand. As Mel exhales a long,
distressing breath.
JUDGE HOLLOWAY
Go on. Professor Ginsburg.
Ruth looks to him. His gentle eyes urging her on avuncularly.
RUTH
The principle purpose of Section
214 is not to protect women nor to
discriminate against men. It is to
provide caregivers the opportunity
to work outside the home. Therefore
-- as the Supreme Court did in Levy
v Louisiana -- this court should
fix the law in the way most in line
with the legislative intent. Extend
the deduction to never-married men.
Help all caregivers equally.

She should be done. She knows that. But she lets herself
linger a moment more. And no one stops her.
RUTH (CONT’D)
Our client, Charles Moritz, was
well raised to be the sort of man
we should all hope our sons will
become. He deserves our admiration.
Not only has he accepted the burden
of caring for his... very strongwilled mother -- when no one would
expect it of him.
The courtroom appreciates her diplomacy.
RUTH (CONT’D)
But in doing so, he has surpassed
the limitations the rest of us -and our laws -- try to force upon
him. We rest our case on our briefs
and argument, and ask that you
reverse the Tax Court’s decision.
The room is silent as Ruth returns to her seat...
INT. 10TH CIRCUIT COURTHOUSE - ROTUNDA - DAY
Amongst the milling crowd, Bozarth and Brown exit the
courtroom.
BOZARTH
I’d say it’s clear we had the
stronger legal footing.
Perhaps.

BROWN

He eyes Ruth, Martin, Jane, Moritz -- ACROSS THE ROOM:

MORITZ
What happens now?
MARTIN
They’ll issue an opinion in a few
months. For now, we wait.
Mel comes running up. Embraces Ruth. Her smile beams.
MEL
Kiki. That was perfect. Perfect.
RUTH
We don’t even know who won.
MEL
It doesn’t matter, Ruth. It was
right.
She’s moved by the sentiment...
It’s as much a question as a promise:
RUTH
This is just the beginning.
With a look, he agrees.
Then he eyes the government lawyers headed out, and gets a
playful air. Bounding off:
MEL
I’m going to gloat.
MORITZ
Martin. Thank you. ... Jane.
(as they embrace:)
Ruth.
RUTH
I’ll be in touch.
As he walks off, Martin turns to Ruth. And they kiss...
Letting it linger.
MARTIN
You did it.
Quietly, Ruth takes his hand... And Jane’s as well. As they
head off together:
We did it.

EXT. U.S. SUPREME COURT - DAY
ESTABLISH: The United States’s temple to the rule of law.
Bag over her shoulder, Ruth approaches the broad front steps.
Where men in suits loiter, talking in close huddles.
SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER -- UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER (V.O.)
Our first case is docket number 704, Reed v Reed -- on appeal from
the Supreme Court of Idaho.
Among the men, Ruth spots Erwin Griswold. And stops short.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER (V.O. -- CONT’D)
Counsel for the appellant. Mr.
Derr, you may proceed.
When Griswold notices her, Ruth holds his gaze. A beat -- as
they size each other up...
Griswold approaches her. And Ruth prepares for it...
GRISWOLD
Mrs. Ginsburg...
He proffers his hand. Moved, she accepts it. And they shake.
DERR (V.O.)
Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court. One hundred years ago,
Myra Bradwell wanted to be a
lawyer...
AS RUTH’S WORDS CONTINUE AND SLOWLY FADE:
She climbs the Supreme Court steps. NOT with wide-eyed awe
this time. WITH CONFIDENCE. Ruth is a woman who knows exactly
where she’s going. She’s determined. Resolute. And unafraid.
Becoming...
THE REAL RUTH BADER GINSBURG (84), Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court. Taking her younger self’s place, in a
matching, contemporary outfit, she ascends the final steps.
Fully the woman she set out to be.
