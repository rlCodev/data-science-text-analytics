INTRODUCTION
INT .. TA.RASCO BAR ROOM· SANTA CECil..IA, tdEXICO- DUSK
P.O.V. of BUSCEMI bursting through the doorway into the bowels of the
stench filled TARASCO BAR Buscemi, an anglo character about 28 xears and
not in the best physical sh.ape, rambles towards the nearest barstool, �hich
seems a mile away in this forced perspective. He inspects the roomful of
roguish, disgusting looking BARFLIES, nursing bottles of cheap booze and
sour dreams of glory in this forgotten Mexican border town. His kind of
people.
He takes a seat, trying to keep his balance on his uneven barstool as the
SHORT BARTENDER finishes serving another customer. It's obvious from
the guarded whispers and ambience that not everyone is here for booze's
sake. Dealing's being done.
SHORT BARTENDER
What do you want?
booze...

BUSCE:Ml

SHORT BARTENDER
All l've got is piss warm, but inexpensive.
BUSCEMI
That's my brand...
SHORT BARTENDER
(looking him over)
Alright.
Short Bartender fetches the drink.
Buscemi soaks up the surroundings like a sponge: how many men are at the
window seats, w.ho' s guarding the baclc, who's flanking the god forsaken altar
of booze where the Short Bartender reigns kin_� supreme.
Short Bartender serves him a dirty glass full of something that more than fits
the desaiption of piss warm and inexpensive. Buscemi swigs it coolly,
savoring every rotten drop.
BUSCEMI
Well this is damn good.

"'-.··.

Short Bartender doesn't have any reason to believe .him.

,____

BUSCEMI
I'd say this is the best booze I've ever had.
Short Bartender knows his booze is cheap, but these undeserved
compliments disturb him.
Actually....

BUSCEMI

Short Bartender tries to ignore him by waiting on one of his regulars. '.
SHORT BARTENDER
You need anything over there?
Negative nods from the Rogues. Nobody's gonna help him get away ·from
this chatter box.

BUSCEMI

...rm just glad to be alive right now.
Short Bartender grabs his own half full brew and sits back against his counter.
He can wait this one out

BUSCEMI

\-....._ .,., ' ' .
...

I was up a few towns away, you know Saragosa?
Short Bartender waits a beat belore surrendering a nod.
BUSCEMI
I was visiting a bar there, not unlike this one, they
served beer, not quite as good as this, but close. ..
and I saw something you wouldn't believe ...
Short Bartender is not on the edge of his seat
BUSCEMI
I'm sitting there see... small table, all by myself.
Now this bar... it was full of real low lives, I
mean... I was wondering what I was doing in
there. .. ya know? Not like this place here... No, I
mean bad... Like they were up to no good, ya
know what rm saying?
A few Rogues exchange drunken looks...
Short Bartender's eyes stay fixed on Buscemi

(leaning in towards BARTENDER)
... but not too secret neither.

A few Rogues seem to have nothing better to do than listen to Buscemi
because that's
- - just what they're doing. · ·

BUSCEMl

(hammering the- point home)
- I'm sitting there_.
Short Bartender.'s not even wondering when. the story's going to start, he's
pouring himself another warm one.

BUSCEMI

So... rm sitting there...
CT.ITTO:
FLASHBACK

\

'"'·�· ..

POV of unseen STRANGER.. opening the bar door, just as we saw Buscemi
do in the opening shot. We hear Buscemi's voice over this dreamy, slow
motion flashback.
ijUSCEMI
(Voice Over)
...And in wallcs the biggest Mexican I've ever seen.
Just walks in lilce he owns the place. Big as shit. No
one knew quite what to make of him, or quite
what to think. But there he was._ and in he
walked...

Now, understand. Buscemi is whiter than the powder they're trading 'neath
the tables. His "biggest Mexican" observation brings slow head turns from the
Rogues that heard him. They're all listening now ... and Short Bartender
even stopped his drinking. Mid sip.
Dark, too.

BUSCEMI

Buscemi is surveying the nearbys. He· has their attention. This is more like it.

BUSCEMI

I don't mean lilce ... dark skinned. No, this was
different. It was as if he was always walking in a
shadow.

{CONTINUED)

,.

CON-rINUEO:
FLASHBACK
We see Stranger walking tall, slow, and faceless towards the bar. The light
from the bar hits him in such a way that you can only see details on his
clothes. But his face is in a shadow, and his head is str�ngely baclclit. �e
passes groups of seated, rough looking, unfriendly folk.
BUSCEMI
(voice over)
I mean, every step he took towards the light, just a.s
you thought his face was going to be revealed...
Stranger nears a light, a bit of his face starting to reveal itself beginning at the
chin and illuminating up to his nose...
.. .It wasn't.

BUSCE:MI

We see the shadow CRAWL bade down his face, obscuring his identity from
everyone.
BUSCEMI
(slowly, otherworldly)
As if the lights ... dimmed... just for him.
The mood is th.idc in the bar, now. The whole room is silent, listening. You
can almost hear a low rumble permeating the room.
The mood is suddenly broken in half by a Rogue's RUDE LAUGH.
Short Bartender joins in. The Rogues go about their business. No amount of
booze is going to change there mind about Buscemi. The verdict is out. He's
full of shit and there's no point in listening to anymore.
BUSCEMI
(continues unaffected)
$o this guy he takes a seat at the bar, asks the
bartender for a soda pop, sits back. .. says nothing.
A soda pop?

SHORT BARTENDER

Buscemi nods.

I

'-

'---'." .

BUSCEMI
Now, I wasn't interested in his drink, I was more
interested in what he was carrying when he walked
in. some sort of suitcase, kind of heavy. He just sat
that thing down on the stool 'side him as if it were
his girl.
(CONTINUED)

CONI'Thl1JED:
FUt..SHBACK
In flashback we see Buscemi peering over from his seat.
Buscemi's POV of a guitar case sitting next to the Stranger, whose face is in
the shadows as he's served his soda pop.

BUSCE.Ml

Then, all of a sudden... the bastard spoke. Started
talking low and whispery with the bartender, and
you know he wasn't tallc.ing soccer. He was talking
business, 'cause whatever he said it was upsetting
the bartender. Especially when he mentioned...
Short Bartender gave up on this character a long time ago. He's finished his
beer and is wiping the mug clean with a dirty rag. He sets the bottle on the
counter beside him.

BUSCEMI

... he said something like... Bitch... or_. Bucho.
That's what it was. Bucho.
Short Bartender stops what he's doing. Buscemi gets a few slow head turns
from the nearby Rogues who heard him. That low rumble is back, and pins
can be heard dropping.

BUSCEMI

(sees he hit a cord)
Well whatever he said... It pissed off the bartender
plenty. And some of those unsavory characters I
told yo1,1 about? Not class acts like these boys here,
but real scum? They got plenty pissed too. So they
get up ..(Buscemi stands for emphasis )
...a.nd they start pulling guns and knives and what
have you. .. starting some shit.
Buscemi has his audience back. He acts the scene out now, and we intercut
between the flashback and Buscemi's live show.

BUSCEMI

Now this Stranger... he BOLTS out of his barstool
like you wouldn't believe, grabs his case like it was
a girl he's been assigned to protect and he DIVES
into the middle of the room with it! Just dives

but what the hell else they got to listen too.

CO�!IN'u"'ED:

BUSCEMl
Now I don't .know what he does on that floor-as
he's somersaulting but he's up in two shakes, the
suitase is wide open and he's pulled god knows
what out of it but whatever it is it's the biggest
hand cannon I've ever seen. ..
FLASHBACK
Stran ger rises from the ground surrounded. by angry scum..nd he levels
what appears to be the BIGGEST FIREARM you've ever seen, we can't really
tell because it spits blinding FIRE so fast you can't get a good look at it, nor
the damage it does as BODIES FLY about the room, mostly in pieces, crashing
into this and that. KNIVES FLASH and get BURIED in the wrong chests,
BULLETS FLY and take out the wrong men. The place is a mad house and
the berserker in the middle i.s the faceless stranger doing WlSpeakably
impressive acts of violence, too fast for the human eye to register, but
enough to make you wonder if he's the devil twnseJJ... and where'd he learn
all those tricks?
His SPURRED BOOTS swoop around the room like a high powered ceiling
fan, the SOUND of flesh being SLICED by the silver spur tips flashing like
crimson lightening.
SHORT BARTENDER
(doubting heavily)
Yo.u're telling me you stood there and watched all
this go on?
All Rogues turn to Short Bartender.
SHORT BARTENDER
You didn't even run for cover, or join in?
Buscemi is staring wide-eyed at Short Bartender like he's just not getting it.
BUSCEMI
What's joining in? I was frozen stiff! All I could do
was watch this.�. thing tear the p�ce apart! I mean
it was amazing! Cutthroat scum bags were coming
out of the woodwork, and dying much deserved
deaths...
We see a few more inaeclible sprinkles of the show: BODIES HURLED out of
ROOF and striking the ground hard, bags of
windows, corpses lil1i"Il'1G

BUSCEMI

turds, and I'm sorry but they got what they
deserved. It was judgement night in that place.
And the whole time..•Th.e whole time this was
going on...
FLASHBACl<
Death-like slow motion of the Stranger in action.

BUSCEMI

(voice over)
.. .I never saw the guy's face.
The rumble is. definitely happening, and the Rogues are as quiet as mutes,
and warm beer is the furthest thing from Short Bartender's mind.

BUSCEMI
...Not once. I mean who could? 'Ole place was
raining blood.
CUI'TO:
Dark, hard to see Stylized Shot of the Stranger standing alone in a HE.AP OF
BODIES, blood DRIPPING from the ceiling in a thick sprinkle. The Stranger
slowly lowers himseli to the ground and grabs hold of a dying turd.
BUSCEMI
(voice over)
So he grabs one of these guys, the only one still
breathing. And starts getting information from
him. I heard 'em talking, so I started wallcing over
... real slow, just for a little peak.•. '
POV of Buscemi moving tow a.rds the Stranger, whose back is to Buscemi.

BUSCEMI (cont'd)
... cause I was moving real slow, took me almost
three whole minutes to get from point A to B, and
when I got there that guy was still spilling it ...

The story comes to a temporary halt.
Buscemi's eyes are fixed on his empty mug. Short Bartender notices this and
immediately grabs the mug. and refills it with some brew, then slowly pushes
it across the counter to Buscemi. Compliments of the house. Buscemi brings
the soupy brew to his lips and freezes.
The room's eyes are on him. Buscemi studies the mug. Practically writes a
book about it.

BUSCE}.,ll

(finally)
Can I have a cleaner mug? Titis one's dirty.

Rogues exchange glances with Short Bartender, who is obviously insulted. I
mean the balls on this guy, asking for a clean glass to Short Bartender's face.
SHORT BARTENDER
Man, fuck you, that's the cleanest one I got.
Buscemi's knows he's lying. Bartender grabs the beer and dumps it into
another glass. Buscemi waits patiently, trying not to notice the cold hard
stares of his waiting audience. Bartender slams the new mug down in front
of Buscemi.
BUSCEMI
(drinks)
So anyway... I get right near this guy, don't ask me
why rm doing this. I just wanted to...
We see Buscemi cautiously walking up to the Stranger, who is aouclled on
· the floor with his back to Buscemi.

BUSCEMI

...shake this guy's hand, I mean one gunfight later
and the planet has SO l� world class turds to
worry about. I me� hallelujah.
Buscemi is right next to Stranger now, looking not unlike someone trying to
muster up courage to ask for an autograph.

BUSCEMI

And then, without warning, without any hint or
preview this guy whips around.... and sees me!

(C01'ITINUEO)

COl\ITI:NUED:
The suspense is killing the Rogues.

BUSCEMI

And I... I see him!

SHORT BARTE1'1DER
You saw his face?

BUSCEMI

His face... no.
{leans forward)
His eyes.

We see Buscemi's POV of the mostly visible face of the Stranger, the
MARIACHI, who is looking deep into Buscemi's eyes, our eyes.
Mariachi releases the Bad Guy's throat, and rises slowly from the corpse
strewn floor. He has his .45 fixed on Buccemi, and stands emotionless.
SHORT BARTEN'DER
(voice over}
And.he didn't do a thing to ya?

BUSCEMI

What was there to do? I suggested that this was
none of my business.
Buscemi shrugs his shoulders helplessly tD Mariachi, as if tD say his presence
was an accident.

BUSCEMI

(voice over)
... and he must have agreed, because he turned his
attention back to the guy on the floor, who right at
this time ...
We see the Bad Guy Mariachi extracted information from, reaching for a
nearby gun.

BUSCEMI

(voice over)
...was reaching.

Low•angle spooky shot of the Mariachi TOWERING over the camera, a slow
turning FAN over his head like some kind of HALO, as he aims his .45 into
the camera and FIRES.

Buscemi looks up at Short Bartender.
What?

BUSCEMI

SHORT BARTENDER
The bartender. Was he killed?
The silence is broken by Laughing Rogue's short bunt of a laugh. But Short
Bartender isn't laughing.
BUSCEMI

Buscemi shakes his head in sorrowful remembrance.
BUSCEMI

He looks worried.
CUT TO:·

CBEPITS SEQUENCE
(__.,

BLACK SCREEN.
A GUITAR is strapped on. Cose-up of TUNING I<N'OBS being tightened,
and �GERS loosening up. A HAND emerges from the darkness,
stnu:runing down over the TAUT STRINGS ... and the playing begins.
The MARIACHI is clean cut, dressed to kill, and playing in his element. He's
in a CLUB of some sort, a classy joint, and h'e plays fast and furious as the
CREDITS roll.
The SONG he plays is elaborate and features his virtuoso guitar work and
baritone voice. He ha.s two other musicians, CAMPA and QUINO standing
behind him. They're all playing guitars.
On Cam.pa's shoulder is a SMALL MONKEY, dressed in his own little black
and white mariachi OUTFIT with a sombrero riding on his back. He
STRUMS his own LI'ITLE GUITAR and then prances around collecting tips.
The song they are playing is catchy and energetic, and one would get the idea
that if it just got outside these walls onto a radio somewhere it would be a big
hit. The girls SCREAM a.s his fingers deftly force the guitar strings to sing
their beautiful melodies.

'·'--·

A FIGHI' has broken out at the other end of the bar, a fight over a girl it
seems, and someone has pulled a KNIFE. Mariachi sees this, and suddenly
LEAPS atop the bar counter. As he plays the intricate patterns that are
required at this point of the song, he walks aaoss the bar, kiclcing a few
glasses off now and again, making his way to the fight.
The KNIFE MAN has his back to Mariachi. Mariachi kneels down on the bar
with his guitar neck just BEHIND the Knife Man's head. Mariachi completes
a stunning and complex section of the song, accenting it by WHA.CI<ING the
back of Knife Man's head. The nearby men and women pull the knife away,
beat Knife Man to a pulp, then carry him out the bar.
The crowd CHEERS for the Mariachi as he walks back across the bar to where
he came from, continuing the song, wooing the girls, and keeping his balance
without missing a note. He's incredible.
Finally, after w�g over several hundred female admirers, all to the
agitation of their dates, he FINISHES the song in a grand display.

i�-

After such an outstanding performance, truly he deserves a standing ovation
to end all ovatiON. He holds his guitar up high above his head after striking
the final chord, and li5teI15 intently for the uproarious applauae that should
follow. He hears nothing ...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
The Mariachi seems dumbfounded. No one moves. The place is completely
dead. All eyes STARE at him. He stands there, like an -idiof, waiting for the
belated applause. It doesn't come.
The c:REDITS continue over this.

-

Mariachi finally hears a sound: the lonely sound of-a single perspn
CLAPPING. The clap is slow and rhythmic, beginning faintly in the back of
the room. The clap grows LOUDER as the person moves towards Mariachi,
who strains to see that far into the darkness.
__
Vvho could it be? The Mariachi doesn't wait to find out, he nods his head,
waves his hand, and says "Thank You" to his unseen friend.
The mystery person, a man in white, his rhythmic clapping now at full
audibility, STEPS OUT of the darkness. Mariachi realizes the man isn't
applauding him at all... but rather CLAPPING A PACK OF MARLBOROS
AG.A.INST HIS HAND, trying to get a cigarette oul He frees one, puts it in his
mouth, and continues walking towards Mariachi. The man is MOCO.
Moco passes his henchman. BIGOTON, who is staring at Mariachi. Moco
STRIKES a match aaoss Bigoton's chin. and lights up his cigarette.
Mariachi lowers his a.rm... The CREDrIS are almost finished.
Someone places their HA1'ID on Mariachi's bade.. Startled, he spins to see
who it is.
DOMINO meets his gaze. He looks surprised to see her. She moves towards
him for a kiss as the last of the CREDrIS roll. As, he nears her lips, a loud
KN'OCI<ING sound is heard offscreen. Mariachi hears it, and shifts his eyes to
the directfon of the sound. Domino is still waiting for her kiss, eyes closed.
He turns his attention bade to Domino. Their lips are nearly touching now. A
kiss long overdue, between lovers of long ago.
The KNOCKING sound again. He finally turns around to see where it's
coming from and we ...

The 1'NOCKING SOUND again.
He throws a g�ce to the chair where his DOG, a Pit Bull, sleeps SOW\�y,
peacefully, unbothered by the noise.
Mariachi crawls out of bed. He STUMBLES to the door, leaning against it. He
takes a moment to regain his senses, catch his breath., and try to remember if
he was expecting_anyone today. He wasn't.
His .45 rises from out of frame, aimed at the door.

MARIACHI

Who is it.

No answer. The wind. Finally ...

realizes that they're not Mexican. They're JAPANESE. They smile at hi:Jn as
they sing their song. He looks at the back of their jackets and sees the
embroidered name: LOS JAPONESES. He notices that the audience is

takes out an unusual COMB (everything Mariachi owns is unusual).
He combs his hair as if on his way to a job interview. He fixes his jacket. He
studies the comb. Obviously a gift from someone. Sentimental value firmly
attached. Mariachi tosses the comb into the street. He doesn1 t expect to come
out of this one alive, and he doesn't really seem to care. He picks up .his

Mariachi sees this and stops the fan with a few bullet hits to the motor.
The fan dies.

anyone that might be a nuisance.

Tavo keeps a safe distance for a few.blocks, then closes the _gap.
The YOUNG WOMAN we saw eulier is buying some fruit at a fruit stand.
She takes her bag and walb on. This is CAROLINA.
Mariachi is walking RIGHT TOWARDS her. They are niREE BLOCKS away
from each other.
Tavo is ONE. BLOCK behind Mariachi. His eyes are SQUINTING, trying to
find a break from the sunlight so he can get a good shot in.
Mariachi must think he's home free, because he's not glancing around
anymore. His eyes are fixed on what at this� appears to be a very
beautiful young woman abo�t 1WO BLOCKS away and closlng.
Tavo takes his GUN out from his shirt. He lets it hang at his side. His fingers
dance aaoss the grip •.. feeling the weight, adjusting his eyes to the sun.•.he
tries to find the moment. He picks up his pace.
Mariachi sees the girl as his lost love DOMINO. She seems to be walking to

starts to JOG.

Mariachi's eyes are fixed on the girl. His heart is poun4ing. Through � eyes
he sees Domino.
Tavo RAISES HIS GUNS as he jogs. Both barrels are AIMED at Mariac:hi's
back. Tavo doesn't want to chance firing at this distance. He must get� close
as he can. We �alize he is just as incompetent as the other money pa�ger.
That's probably why they work the bathroom.

The guns are BARRELING towards Mariachi at FULL SPEED. Tavo is trying
to shake as little as possible. There's no going back.
Carolina's sees the man RUNNlNG at Mariachi, she SEE.S the guns and
SCREAMS just as Mariachi SPINS and sees the barrels coming for his face.
Mariachi LEAPS atop Carolina and PULLS her to the ground, SHIELDING
her with his body from the gun blasts that take a good size CHUNK OF
FLESH from his upper left arm.
Tavo TRIPS over them and CRASHES to the ground.

Carolina turns her head in time to see Tavo AIMING a gun right at her. She
sees Mariachi JUMP atop Tavo, PU�G the g1m downward.
The gun FIRES, and large pieces of CONCRETE burst up a foot away from
Carolina's face.

gwu:nan,

Mariachi is struggling with the
the barrels alternating between
aiming at Mariachi and aiming at Tavo. Finally Mariac:hi delivers a
devastating HEAD-BUl'T that temporarily SIUNS them both. Mariachi
shoves the pistols under Tavo's � pulls the triggers, and ends it.
Mariachi staggers to his feet, then falls into 'Carolina's arms. Blood pours
from his arm.
Carolina is looking. around for someone that can help. Not on this street.

As they climb up to the ROOF, Carolina looks over the side of the building
and watches the flames lick the walls.
They run to the OPPOSITE side of the roof where they can jump to another
building. He peers over the side. A few men WAITING down in the alley fire
a few rounds up at him. He pulls away as the conaete near his face COUGHS

They break apart from each other, exchanging desperate looks as Mari�chi
releases the empty clip from his gun.
A Shot at the ground level shows the empty clip hit the ground.
From this angle we see Carolina removing her mismatched shoes and
putting them in her coat pockets.

Both Mariachi and Carolina stare helplessly at the Bad Guy as he tries :
desperately to climb up. Blood seeps from the comers of h.is mouth. He looks
genuinely TERRIFIED, and quite pathetic. This dilemma disturbs Mariachi

One of the Bad Guy's hands SUPS, and we can tell Carolina is pondering
saving the man. Mariachi is thinking the same thing.
Bad Guy brings his hand back up, only this time it has a GUN in it.
Our Heroes' expression changes from one of concern, to one of CONTEMPT.

Mariachi takes two GRENAD5 from his case and pulls the pins. He holds
them up for a few seconds then DROPS them over the side.

GUITAR FIGHTER #1
This Guitar Fighter's GUITAR CASE is different. He doesn't have to open
the lid. The FRONT PANEL on the guitar SLIDES open, exposing the
BARREL. He siJl:tply aims the ENTIRE CASE. The barrel at the front of the
case SPITS the bullets. He �ply waves the guitar wherever he wants to
shoot.
The Limo is RIDDLED with bullets from Machine Gun Guitar Fighter's case_

The second Guitar Fighter steps up to the. plate with HlS ase. His guitar is
different from the others as well. He simply SWINGS his case up to his
shoulder. It seats comfortably there, and in this position the case looks like a

the Limo. This seems to �ause some major dents and topical damage, if not
shake up the men inside quite a bit.
The Sunroof Sniper is scared SHITLESS at this new development. The men
inside are. trying to get the phone to work. They are all shaken up.
The driver tries to restart the engine. The side doors BURST open and a few

cars.
The Machine Gun Guitar Fighter ANGLES his guitar c:ase in the direction of

Machine Gun Guitar Fighter is doing a good job of almost SINGLE­

Mariachi's eyes DART about.... He finally sees the Boy lying
motionless on the sidewalk aaoss the street, partly obscured by a
TELEPHONE POLE. His BLOODY HAND is outstretched to the
GUITAR lying beside him. The fire spread around by the explosion is
nearing him.
Mariachi RUNS out halfway aaoss the street. He stops in his tracks,
pondering for the moment if he should abandon the Guitar Fighter to help
the boy or stand his ground and back him up.
Guitar Fighter stares at him as if this shouldn't be an ussue. 'Stand you're

The Monkey climbs into Mariachi's guitar case and finds his own little guitar

The last few Henchman slowly creep out from hiding, out from the bu.ming
wreckage of parked cars, and proceed to find the Last Mariachi.
The Monkey opens his guitar case and finds a small PISTOL, then darts down
the street towards the Henchman in front of the group.
The Hencluna.n sees the tiny aeature darting towards him and before he can
react the Monkey leaps to the man's chest and grabs his collar. With the
other hand he shoves· his tiny pistol into the Henchman's face and fires.
The tiny blast blinds the Henchman, who falls back clasping his bloody £ace.
The other Henchmen are stunned as the Monkey leaps under a car and

The Henchmen look about for the Monkey who may pop out at any time.
