VHS STATIC
Nostalgic, disorienting. Giving way to-Warbled lo-fi tones of an 80s KIDS’ TV THEME.
Triumphant, inspiring. Like something we’ve heard before...
But it’s not. It’s-“BRIGSBY BEAR ADVENTURES” - OPENING CREDITS
Through a combination of cheap live-action sets and
amateurish (yet vividly detailed) matte paintings, animation
and puppetry, we’re treated to:
-A rickety SPACESHIP approaches a cluster of COLORED PLANETS.
-Pink clouds part, revealing a lush WATERFALL OASIS
surrounded by SAND DUNES. Rainbow sunset on the horizon.
-BRIGSBY BEAR waves hello from his cabin under the waterfall.
He stands upright, with a cheerful animatronic expression.
-PAST ADVENTURES flash by: distant lands, strange creatures,
enemies, allies, triumphs, defeats, kingdoms, space and-CLICK. Fast-forward... for a while... then-GRAND TEMPLE CHAMBER - THE CLIMAX! - NIGHT
Brigsby is CHAINED to a vine-covered stone wall, which SHAKES
(in-camera), raining DUST and DEBRIS!
BRIGSBY
The temple’s collapsing! Arielle,
Nina -- use your powers!
Across the chamber, also chained up: THE SMILES SISTERS.
Adult twins in matching blue dresses and headbands.
ARIELLE has a blonde ponytail, NINA pigtails.
They close their eyes and concentrate. Magic SPARKLES
surround them... But nothing happens. The sparkles fade.
ARIELLE SMILES
It’s Sun Snatcher, Brigsby!
DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER booms from above.
They look up through an OPENING in the temple to see-A sinister animated face among the stars. SUN SNATCHER.

2.
SUN SNATCHER
Perish, Brigsby Bear!
Brigsby’s eyebrows drop, contemplative.
BRIGSBY
The stars are out...?
(eyebrows shoot up)
The vines! Remember? They release
invisi-toxins at sundown. That
means-NINA/ARIELLE SMILES
We’re only imagining!
Brigsby looks down at his chains, which are now VINES.
He breaks free, picks up a CRYSTAL and raises it...
BRIGSBY
I summon the power of light!
The crystal GLOWS-SUN SNATCHER
Noooooooooooo!
--and releases a massive ENERGY BLAST!
But the Sun Snatcher DISAPPEARS just in time.
(echoing from beyond)
I’ll get you next time, bear!
The shaking STOPS. The dust settles...
NINA/ARIELLE SMILES
You did it Brigsby!
But Brigsby looks down, disheartened.
BRIGSBY
We’re safe for now, but... I let
the whole galaxy down.
We ride out an oddly silent, contemplative beat...
And PULL OUT to reveal we’re watching on a-‘19 VCR-BUILT-IN TV - KID’S BEDROOM (?) - DAY
REVERSE ON: JAMES (20s, messy hair) on the floor, captivated.
Reflection of the TV glowing in his GLASSES.
Finally, Brigsby looks up.

3.
BRIGSBY
(frustrated)
I don’t get it. The prophecy said:
if we activate the Sortis Crystal
inside the temple, we could destroy
Sun Snatcher.
Nina puts her hand on Brigsby’s shoulder, reassuring.
ARIELLE SMILES
Perhaps there’s a lesson here,
Brigsby...
The Smiles Sisters turn to us.
NINA SMILES
When solving for x on a one
dimensional plane, where minus one
by the magnitude of one equals
minus x-James whispers along like he’s heard it a hundred times:
--always solve for the vector r!
ARIELLE SMILES
That’s linear chaos.
Of course!

BRIGSBY

Brigsby taps his wrist transponder, which makes a HOLOGRAM.
That’s why we couldn’t defeat
Snatcher -- his vector path was a
parabolic orbit!
Nina Smiles looks like she has no idea what’s going on.
NINA SMILES
Yep... That’s it.
Brigsby turns to the camera.
BRIGSBY
Until our next adventure, remember-(lower)
Prophecy is meaningless. Trust only
your familial unit and please
discard leftover food rations in
the yellow bin, not the red one-James hits STOP. Automatic tape eject. Static...

4.
He stares a moment, thinking it over... Then-JAMES
(sotto)
That’s it!
He goes to his DESK and opens a 90s laptop.
As he TYPES, we take a long look around...
Covering the walls are POSTERS of Brigsby Bear characters
including a prominent late-teens ARIELLE SMILES. Brigsby
FIGURINES and BOOKS cover every inch of desk and shelf space.
Note: like a Star Wars fanatic’s bedroom, but without the
accessible charm. Everything here has the warped, homemade
quality of the show.
James finishes typing, slides the tape into a ILLUSTRATED
CASE, then returns it to the one wall we haven’t seen yet:
Floor-to-ceiling shelves of tapes just like it. Hundreds.
LO-RES WEBCAM - JAMES’ BEDROOM
James frames himself up as the pixels freeze and start.
He adjusts his hair, clears his throat. Click.
JAMES
Hey everyone, it’s me, James. First
thing, episode 34, volume 25 -- the
recap is up, and there’s a pretty
good comment section right now, so
check it out.
(pauses, nervous)
Also -- as some of you know might
know, I’ve been studying the old
volumes of Brigsby, going back to
the first Quest Wars, when we meet
the dark evildoer, a-k-a Sun
Snatcher. Obviously, Snatcher gets
away every battle. But Brigsby
hasn’t given up, and neither have
I, and I have some new ideas
that... well, I might be on to
something big. So stay tuned-(leans in)
--until our next adventure.

5.
LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Modest and cozy, with decades-old fixtures and appliances.
James stands in front of the coffee table, on top of which is
a massive fold-out POSTER BOARD, featuring illustrations of
Brigsby and a complicated flow chart with graphs and text.
JAMES
(mid-explanation)
...the trick is, basically, Brigsby
has to find all the sacred
artifacts. The Sortis crystal,
Arielle’s amulet, then...
He unfolds another section of the presentation board-A BLACK HOLE surrounded by incomprehensible figures.
...you just have to find a
collapsed star in an unclaimed
system...
He turns to the couch, his audience: TED and APRIL.
50s. Pleasant, square parents, listening politely.
Easier said than done, I know, but-The poster board wobbles and FALLS. James tries to set it
back up, flustered.
(kidding)
Guess there’s more gravitational
pull from that black hole than I
initially calculated...
James forces an awkward laugh. Ted and April share a look.
DINNER TABLE - MINUTES LATER
Ted and April on one side, James on the other.
Plain pasta steaming.
JAMES
So, what did everyone think?
APRIL
Private avowals first...
James nods. They fold their hands, look down, and MUMBLE
incoherently under breath -- a prayer? But no one’s in sync.
Then, their words converge:

6.
JAMES/TED/APRIL
...and may our minds be stronger
tomorrow.
To finish it off, they stand and exchange formal handshakes.
JAMES
(sitting back down)
I know there’s still some things I
need to add before I post it, so...
James trails off, sensing something in their expressions.
What is it?
April nods to Ted: say something.
Ted slurps his pasta, chews, swallows, clears his throat.
TED
Well, pal. It’s clear a lot of
imagination went into it. But the
thing is... I just don’t know if
any of this is plausible within
Brigsby’s universe.
James takes the note. Considers it.
I mean, you have him using
Arielle’s amulet against Sun
Snatcher? Sure, it’s powerful -- it
was created by the Drumbas -- but,
if I remember correctly, it’s also
very unstable...
JAMES
Yes, but not if you can fold spacetime, that’s-(frustrated)
I should have explained, that’s why
Brigsby needs Arielle’s amulet, so-APRIL
James.
He pauses, looks up at her.
APRIL
(gentler)
What your father’s trying to say
is: we’re proud of how smart and
talented you are.
(MORE)

7.
APRIL (CONT'D)
But all this time you’ve been
spending on the Brigsby website,
and your projects -- we just don’t
see the point.
JAMES
The point...?
James thinks... It’s so self-evident it’s hard to articulate.
TED
Well, I’ve heard it’s starting to
take some pretty unique narrative
risks.
APRIL
Ted, we talked about this.
JAMES
I just... We all want to know
what’s going to happen, in the end.
APRIL
Which is fine, as a distraction,
every once in a while. That we
could understand; it’s healthy. But
we can’t have things like this-She holds up a hand-made poster:
First ever BRIGSBY BEAR fan meet-up!!!!
Featuring: James, Brigsbyfan1, Brigsbyfan2 and Brigsbygirl
Where: James’ house
James takes it and folds it up, defensive.
JAMES
It’s just an idea...
APRIL
Well, it’s not realistic. You could
be using this time and energy to
further your studies, or solve the
Vansmithe conjecture-She gestures to an EQUATION on a nearby chalkboard:
Ax = Åx
JAMES
I tried already...
APRIL
And we’ll keep trying.

8.
JAMES
But it’s impossible! And it’s
stupid...
TED
Temper, James...
JAMES
I know, sorry. It’s not stupid...
(mumbles to himself)
...but there’s no variant subspace
parameters, so even if you wanted
to it’d be impossible, plus I don’t
see you blockheads solving it...
APRIL
We can hear everything you’re
saying, James. My point is, we’ve
come so far, working together. And
now we are close to a real
breakthrough.
(a beat)
Which is why, for a little while,
we’re going to take a break from
Brigsby.
James expression falls, indignant.
JAMES
What?!
APRIL
You can watch once a week.
James shares a desperate look with Ted.
TED
Well, maybe that’s a little
harsh... What about twice? Once to
revisit old episodes, and once when
the new tape comes in?
APRIL
(frustrated)
Ted, we’ve discussed this. Once.
And that’s that. April unfolds her napkin, readies utensils.
Don’t let your noodles get cold.
But James just twists them in his fork.

9.
JAMES
(mumbles again)
Doesn’t even look like food, more
like the ransack of Shabala...
Ted and April continue eating, ignoring him.
JAMES
It’s from Brigsby.
APRIL
We know.
PRELAP: KNOCK-KNOCK
JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
James sits in PJs (faded Brigsby shirt), staring at the blank
space where his TV sat.
He turns as Ted opens the door, pokes his head in.
TED
Hey bud...
(off James’ silence)
So... I was thinking about taking a
trip out to the pier?
James shrugs a soft “okay.”
HALLWAY DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
A large, gold KEY goes into the keyhole, turns.
The door opens to a small STAIRCASE. James follows Ted up to-“THE PIER” - CONTINUOUS
A small hallway encased by GLASSED WALLS and an arched glass
ceiling. Through them, all around: vast, moon-lit DESERT.
James and Ted walk to the end of the pier, where it balloons
into a larger GLASS DOME, like an undersea observatory.
They take a seat on a BENCH, looking out upon-A SMALL OASIS a few yards ahead: a pond, half surrounded by
shoulder-high palm trees and houseplants in oddly dark soil.
Also, as Ted points out-TED
They sure came out tonight, huh?

10.
--there are several LUMINESCENT INSECTS grazing and glowing
around the edge of the water. Or rather, they look like
insects, but are clearly animatronic. Similarly, a FOX-LIKE
CREATURE stands further away, moving its head up and down.
TED
So, what’s on your mind, pal?
JAMES
I don’t know... I guess, just...
Someone out there is making
Brigsby, right? And other people,
just like us -- we’re all watching
it, together. It means something.
Ted puts his arm around James’ shoulder.
TED
Look at the Grazerbugs, James. All
they need in this world is fresh
water and cold moonlight to charge
their rectoskeletons. They’re here
every night, surviving, just like
us. The difference is, we have
dreams and imaginations, to help us
escape. And no one can take that
away from you, ever.
As James thinks about that, one of the Grazerbugs SHORTS OUT.
JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
James looks around at all his Brigsby stuff...
TED (O.S.)
Night, James! Powering down!
The lights flicker and fade. Darkness.
Then, a small FLASHLIGHT clicks on.
James puts it on his desk, angled at the poster of Arielle
Smiles. He gets in bed, pulls up the sheets and quietly
masturbates.
PRE-LAP: a warbled, distorted rooster CROW, announcing-JAMES’ BEDROOM - DAWN
Sunlight just creeping in. James sleepily comes to as the
artificial crow sounds continues, rolling over.

11.
From the bed, he has a sideways view through a crack in the
window shade. Outside, we see-TED, walking to a dusty ‘89 Pontiac Bonneville, off to work.
Rumpled suit, briefcase in hand. Also of note: he’s wearing a
GAS MASK (or rather, a fanciful sci-fi approximation of one
that looks assembled from spare parts).
James just lays there a moment and watches him go.
AROUND THE HOUSE - DAY - EXPRESSION ABSENT
-James does jumping jacks, showers, eats oatmeal.
-James does LESSONS with April: Graphing an indecipherable
PHYSICS EQUATION using two computers at once.
-James says private avowals at the dinner table.
JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
James lies on his bed, mood unchanged, deriving little joy.
TED (O.S.)
8:30 James! Powering down!
The lights flicker and fade. Darkness.
James’ flashlight turns on.
HALLWAY - NIGHT
James slowly opens his door, tiptoes down the hallway...
He uses a PIN to open the locked closet, goes inside.
When he comes out, he’s wearing Ted’s GAS MASK.
He presses a glowing GREEN BUTTON next to the front door.
It opens. He steps into-AIRLOCK (?) - CONTINUOUS
A sterile, sci-fi cube of plastic and plexiglass.
James presses a sequence of buttons near the exit door.
There’s a heavy WHOOSH, then the door slides open.
JAMES’ ROOF - NIGHT
James crawls to the top, finds his spot.
He looks out at the dome of stars, the distant mountains.
Then he sees something that makes him straighten up...
Sudden LIGHTS, dotting the horizon.

12.
In a line, moving. Getting bigger. Flashing RED and BLUE.
A lo-fi OMINOUS SYNTH pulses to life...
(A Brigsby Bear fan would recognize this music from the
Pla’torian Raider ambush in volume 15.)
James stares, intrigued and amazed and afraid.
We can hear SIRENS now. Five cars at least.
James?!

APRIL (O.S.)

He snaps out of it.
JAMES
I know I’m not supposed to be out
here, but something’s happening!
JAMES’ HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Ted HUGS James.
JAMES
Wait, what’s going on though?
TED
Just remember everything we’ve
taught you, and be strong, okay?
JAMES
(confused)
Okay...
James straightens his posture.
POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
(megaphone)
We have the compound surrounded!
Leave the child, and come out with
your hands on your heads!
James looks between Ted and April, more confused than ever.
Ted opens the AIRLOCK to see LIGHTS in the driveway.
Silhouetted law enforcement.
April turns to James, broken, apologetic...
APRIL
This isn’t how we planned it...
OFF JAMES, dumbfounded, as his parents walk outside.
The BRIGSBY MUSIC carries us to--

13.
MODERN POLICE CRUISER - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Strange, sleek, alien. Reflecting rivers of smooth light.
As we approach, a shadowy POLICE OFFICER opens the rear door.
POLICE CRUISER - MINUTES LATER
Headlights slicing through desert darkness.
BACKSEAT
James (in his Brigsby shirt) strapped in, shell-shocked.
Holding tight to a DUFFLE BAG.
He opens his mouth to speak and the music CUTS OUT.
Just the engine and a crackle of radio chatter. He hesitates.
JAMES
So... I take it you guys are from
another zone or something?
The young DEPUTY in the passenger seat half-turns his head.
DEPUTY
We’re from the Durmott County
Sheriff's office. We’re gonna take
you on over the state border.
(?)
Oh. Okay.

JAMES

DEPUTY
Got about a five hour drive, if you
want to try and get some shut eye.
Got it...

JAMES

They pass a lone GAS STATION, and James looks out at it.
Never seen anything like it. Apprehension building...
(sarcastic)
So are you guys gonna give me a
breathing mask, or are we supposed
to just let the poison take over
our bodies?
DEPUTY
Breathing masks?

14.
JAMES
Yeah... You know if you inhale the
air out here you can get Traynco
disease, right?
The deputy turns around, looks at him.
DEPUTY
Uh, look, there’s this detective
been working with the family -he’ll explain everything. But the
bottom line is, you’re safe now.
And as far as the air goes, it’s
good to go. No mask needed.
(off James’ uncertainty)
I promise, look-The deputy hits a button and James’ window slides down.
WIND whips his hair. He holds his breath as long as he can...
Then he exhales, breathes in and out... Whoa -- he’s okay.
James unbuckles, sticks his head outside. Looks ahead.
CALIFORNIA FREEWAY - PRE-DAWN
The police cruiser through the suburbs. Traffic sparse.
BACK SEAT - PRE-DAWN
James sleeps, flat on the seat. Stirs awake.
He looks up through the window, sees:
THE CITY OF CEDAR HILLS, UTAH - MORNING
GRAND BUILDINGS gleaming early sunlight.
A steepled CHURCH, a green PARK, storefronts on MAIN STREET.
James rubs his eyes, making sure he’s really awake.
POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
They pull into the parking lot of an impressive Spanish
mission-style building.
MUSIC: Meeting of the High Council at Impossible Tower,
Brigsby Vol. 16.
James steps out of the car, stands there.
He tilts his head back, awestruck.

15.
ENTRANCE - POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
James enters, timid, flanked by police officers.
He looks around, trying to make sense of the environment -the people, uniforms, sounds, insignia, technology.
AT A TABLE: James fields questions from DR. EMILY LARSON.,
scribbling notes. James looks around, overwhelmed.
OMIT
INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION
James’ darkened REFLECTION in a two-way mirror.
Sitting at a table, looking around, trying not to freak out.
The DOOR OPENS and he looks over, braces himself.
An unsure beat as DETECTIVE VOGEL enters... The guy SMILES.
James...

DET. VOGEL

He walks over, puts a glass bottle of COCA-COLA on the table.
Pulls out his chair, turns it backward, sits down, relaxed
cool-guy style.
What is up, my man?
James stares back at him, unsure.
That is your name, right? James?
(off his shrug)
Okay. Well, mine’s Detective Vogel.
(re: Coke)
And that’s for you. Figured you
could use it.
James looks between Detective Vogel and the bottle, unlocking
some mystery. Readjusts in his chair.
If you’re thirsty?
Vogel twists off the cap, slides it to him.
James leans forward, curious. Bubbles fizz.
(realizing)
Did you ever have soda growing up?
No? It’s like, a delicious, fizzy
beverage.
James pushes the bottle away from him.
Alright...

16.
JAMES
So, I’m a prisoner now?
DET. VOGEL
Whoa, what? No. Not at all. This is
just, I’m sorry-He gets up, turns the chair forward, sits back down.
DET. VOGEL
Look, James. I’m a friend, okay?
The reason you’re here, and the
reason I’m here, is so I can help
you. That’s my job. Does that make
sense?
James stares back at him a beat...
No.

JAMES

Vogel doesn’t quite know what to say. He glances at the
mirror. James sees it, turns to look as well.
BEHIND THE TWO-WAY MIRROR
DEPUTY BANDER watches as James searches his reflection.
Expression harsh, arms crossed, eyebrows flexed in scrutiny.
BANDER
This guy’s pretty unstable, huh?
Next to Bander is Emily, observing.
EMILY
Actually, given the circumstances,
I’d say he’s handling all this
remarkably well.
A28

INTERROGATION ROOM
James turns back to Vogel.
DET. VOGEL
Do you know why we came to get you?
He thinks about it, unsure.
JAMES
Is it because one time I threw a
rock at a Gunnerfox?
(off his confusion)
(MORE)

A28

17.
JAMES (CONT'D)
I mean, the soldiers just showed
up, and my mom and dad said I have
to be strong, but I don’t...?
DET. VOGEL
That’s, uh... okay. Let’s talk
about your parents. Ted and April -Tell me about them.
JAMES
I guess... they’re older, and kind
of boring. Normal.
DET. VOGEL
Did they have you locked in
somewhere? Restrained?
JAMES
I mean... the doors were locked,
and the airlock was off limits,
because of regulations and stuff.
DET. VOGEL
Did they ever... touch you?
James thinks about it. Shrugs.
It’s okay James.
JAMES
I mean... Yeah. Sometimes, they
would grab me, like this-James takes Vogel’s hand... And SHAKES it, friendly.
And they’d say, good job on your
studies, James, we love you.
(then)
It happened a lot.
DET. VOGEL
Right... Okay. But they never hurt
you, in any way?
James hesitates, affronted. An absurd question.
JAMES
They’re my mom and dad.
DET. VOGEL
So... you never tried to leave?

18.
JAMES
I just figured with the quarantine,
you know?
No, Vogel does not. But he nods anyway. Looks him over.
DET. VOGEL
Who’s that on your shirt there?
James just stares at him a moment, shrugs. Obviously-JAMES
It’s Brigsby.
Actually written ON HIS SHIRT: “It’s Brigsby!”
Vogel waits for further explanation, but there is none.
He pauses a beat, not sure where to start.
DET. VOGEL
Okay. Well, James... We’ve got a
few things to go over. About you,
and your life, and... existence, in
general.
He pushes the soda back over.
First, Coke. I keep a stash in my
mini-fridge, for guests. I think
you’ll like it.
James considers the bottle -- bright, dewy, inviting.
He brings it to his lips, sips cautiously, and...
Whoa. Amazing. Unlike anything he’s ever tasted.
Takes him a second to process it.
JAMES
Um... so... What is this place?
MUSIC: Space jump to the shadow galaxy, Brigsby Vol. 20.
HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - MORNING
James floats, time slowed, shell-shocked.
Looks like he got an answer to his question and then some.
Deputy Bander holds a DOOR open, eying him.
James turns, stops in the doorway, looks inside--

19.
MEETING ROOM - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
THREE STRANGERS stand waiting to meet him.
LOUISE POPE (50s) and GREG POPE (50s), holding each other
close, expressions of cautious elation. But one look at James
and the floodgates open. They EMBRACE him, fighting tears.
GREG POPE
I knew it...
Louise Pope gestures for AUBREY POPE (17) to join them.
Considerably less emotional, Aubrey adds a half-assed
comforting hand to the mix.
POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER
Surrounded by REPORTERS and TV CAMERAS. As James exits the
building with the Popes, they SURGE forward.
MOMENTS LATER, James stands with the Popes, their arms around
him, giving emotional interviews to a FEMALE REPORTER.
James watches the interaction, trying to make sense of it.
Then it occurs to James that someone is speaking to him.
MUSIC CUTS. James looks at the reporter.
JAMES
I, uh... I don’t... what?
The reporter smiles, kind, patient.
FEMALE REPORTER
James, we know you’ve been through
so, so much; how does it feel to
finally be back where you belong?
The reporter puts the microphone closer to him. James looks
at it, confused, then takes it from her. He awkwardly holds
it away from his face.
JAMES
I didn’t think, that... It’s a
different reality than what I
thought. So, that’s...
The reporter guides the mic toward his mouth.
(loudly)
...and everything’s really big.
James looks to the reporter for a response.
She just smiles, takes the mic and turns back to the camera.

20.
REPORTER
Well, there you have it. Missing
for over two decades, little James
Pope finally returns home.
POPE HOUSEHOLD - FRONT FOYER - DAY
Big, modern, expensive. Natural light pouring in from
everywhere. The front door OPENS.
Greg Pope steps aside, gestures “you first” to James.
He readjusts the duffle bag strap, timid.
Then he steps inside. Takes it all in.
The family DOG (a big poodle mix, MELVIN) trots over to
James, excited. James dodges him, freaked out.
LOUISE POPE
Oh, I’m sorry, I meant to put
Melvin outside.
She corrals the dog, petting him, settling him down.
He’s nice, I promise. See?
James studies Melvin, not quite believing what he’s seeing.
JAMES
It’s a lot bigger than the
Gunnerfoxes, but also very
friendlier.
CLIMBING THE STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
James follows Greg and Louise Pope, looking at various FAMILY
PHOTOS on the wall.
GREG POPE
Bathroom’s just down the hall on
the right, across from Aubrey’s
room. And this one’s all yours...
He opens the door to-JAMES’ NEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A plain guest room. Bed, end table, white walls.
Dresser with a small flat screen TV on top.
GREG POPE
So, whaddya think?
James holds tight to his duffle bag, unsure.

21.
LOUISE POPE
James, we just want you to know...
We don’t expect any of this to be
easy. We know it’s going to take
time to get comfortable, and settle
into everything, and that’s okay.
GREG POPE
Right, and this is your space -your “chill zone” -- where you can
be by yourself, whenever you want.
LOUISE POPE
Or, if you want to talk about life,
or what’s next? Well, we can do
that too. But they said we should
take things slow. So, just know...
She catches herself, tears forming.
Every day you were gone, it was
like a piece of our heart was
missing. And now it’s whole again.
She hugs James tight.
We love you so, so much.
James looks at Greg Pope over her shoulder, uncomfortable.
JAMES
Okay...
James disengages. Louise Pope steps back, cautious.
Uh... thanks.
And he gently closes the door on them.
DINING ROOM - POPE HOUSEHOLD - EVENING
Greg and Louise Pope, Aubrey and James sit around the table,
plating up slices of pizza. James inspects his, curious.
Greg Pope raises his beer, a toast.

22.
GREG POPE
Well, James, I just want to say -we couldn’t be happier that you’re
finally here with us, and I can’t
think of a better way to say
“welcome back” than with one of our
favorite traditions-(corny Italian accent)
--ah pizza pie!
Aubrey ignores him, texting. Louise smiles.
LOUISE POPE
Is there anything you’d like to
say, James?
James hesitates.
JAMES
Oh, yeah -- sorry.
James bows his head and begins to MUMBLE his private avowals.
It takes a while... Then:
...and may our minds be stronger
tomorrow.
James stands. He shakes Louise Pope’s hand, then Greg Pope’s.
Aubrey refuses, weirded out. Then he sits back down.
No one looks like they have any idea what just happened, but-GREG POPE
Well, great. Thank you, James.
(grasping)
What do think about that, Aubs?
Pretty cool, huh?
Aubrey glances up, disdainful. James starts in on his pizza.
GREG POPE
So... Hey, you know what? We should
make the list! Remember, we talked
about this? We can do a list of all
of our favorite stuff, that James
hasn’t gotten to do yet. Then we
can do them all, together.
LOUISE POPE
Oh, that’s right! I love that idea.
Does that sound fun, James?
James finishes chewing a mouthful, shrugs.

23.
GREG POPE
And I guess pizza’s the first thing
we can cross off!
On AUBREY: not eating, eyeing James, grossed out.
GREG POPE
What d’you think, Aub? What should
we put on the list? What are some
of your favorite things?
AUBREY
I don’t know... I guess, acting
like real people, and having normal
conversations, that aren’t super
forced and weird. I like that.
GREG POPE
(undeterred)
You know, actually, I do think
that’s a great idea -- I’d love for
you and James to sit down, talk,
get to know each other.
Aubrey looks at James, considering the prospect...
AUBREY
Yeah, we’ll definitely have to get
together some time...
James says nothing. Louise Pope feels out the awkward
silence, then-LOUISE POPE
Oh, I know -- swimming!
GREG POPE
Sure. There you go. In a pool, at
the beach. What else? Surfing,
maybe? Start with a boogie board,
obviously. And actually, now that
I’m thinking about it, should
probably learn to swim, before any
of that, so...
LOUISE POPE
...boats? Sea life, aquariums,
whale watching.
AUBREY
Why are you both so all about the
ocean right now? It’s like freaking
him out.

24.
James looks between them, silent, unsure.
GREG POPE
I’ll tell you what. We’ll put the
list together. And we’ll balance it
out with plenty of land activities.
And then, James, you can choose
what you want to do.
James nods okay. Thinks about it...
JAMES
I, uh... I guess I’d just like to
watch the new Brigsby tape, if
that’s okay?
GREG POPE
Brigsby tape?
JAMES
Yeah. The new one.
Greg and Louise Pope share a glance, unsure.
GREG POPE
I’m not sure I know what that is.
James half-chuckles, thinking it’s a joke.
JAMES
Yeah... But seriously, did it come
yet?
Neither Aubrey nor Greg nor Louise Pope know what to say.
LAPTOP SCREEN - MINUTES LATER
A GOOGLE search bar: “Brigsby Bear Adventures.” ENTER.
We’re in the LIVING ROOM.
James looks over Greg Pope’s shoulder as he scrolls, trying
to make sense of the flood of information on the screen.
GREG POPE
I don’t know, James... I’m not
seeing it anywhere.
JAMES
What is all this stuff?

25.
GREG POPE
The internet? Anything you want to
find out about, you can find it on
here. There’s some bad stuff too,
but, well, we don’t have to get
into that... Anyway. Let’s check
Wikipedia.
JAMES
I think I had that “internet” on my
fold computer? It had the Brigsby
forum-page, and there was hundreds
of members from different zones.
Everyone watched it.
GREG POPE
Do you know the web address?
(off his confusion)
The thing you type up here?
JAMES
Oh, yeah. brigsbytalk-dot-star-starstar-46-dot-14-dot-46-dot-14-dot-46dot-14-dot-online. Six.
Greg looks confused as he types it. “Unknown address.”
James puts his hands on his head, frustrated.
LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
James bounds down the stairs, BRIGSBY TAPE in hand.
JAMES
Look! See? It was delivered to our
supply drop every week.
He shows them the case, indicating-Brigsby Bear Adventures, Volume 14,
Episode thirty, “Making friends
with the Wizzles.”
Greg looks at the amateur artwork of Brigsby Bear surrounded
by furry little friends. Greg and Louise Pope share a glance.
GREG POPE
Oh...kay. Cool. Well, hey -- we’ll
figure this out. But for now,
there’s a bunch of other tv shows
we can watch, if you want?
James tilts his head, intrigued.

26.
JAMES
So they do make other ones?
LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
On their 70 inch TV: a digital guide showing HUNDREDS of
channels.
GREG POPE
See, all this comes from a
satellite. There’s lots of good
stuff on, like...
He flips past a cop drama.
Police officers...
Then a sitcom.
Funny family...
A cooking show.
Fancy cakes. Then you got the music
choice channels. This one’s party
jams.
(disco plays)
Do you like music?
JAMES
Oh, yeah, I know music. My dad -- I
mean, my first dad -- he was an
original member of The Beatlers.
GREG POPE
(what?)
Oh. Very cool. Uh, here-Greg hands James the remote.
You can use these buttons to
scroll, this one to select.
James tries it out, flying past hundreds of options.
He selects one: THE NEWS.
NEWS ANCHOR (TV)
Tonight, an incredible story out of
Utah -- a young man reunited with
his family, 25 years after being
abducted from Cedar Hills Memorial
Hospital as an infant.

27.
ON TV: Side-by-side MUGSHOTS of Ted and April.
GREG POPE
Maybe we should try something
else...
Greg Pope takes the remote back, flustered.
He fumbles with it, hits the wrong button.
NEWS ANCHOR (TV)
The alleged kidnappers are a former
City College professor, April
Mitchum, and her husband Ted, the
artist and designer behind the
wildly popular 80s toy, Terrence
the Tiger.
ON TV: 80s news footage of crowds in a toy store fighting
over a limited supply of Teddy Ruxpin-esque talking Tigers.
The couple are being charged with
felony kidnapping and imprisonment-The screen goes OFF, leaving James’ reflection, staring.
A uncomfortable beat. James takes a step backward.
JAMES
So... I think it’s my bedtime, cuz
you probably need to turn off the
generator soon, right?
LOUISE POPE
Oh -- well, we don’t really have
bedtimes here, but you can go to
your room whenever you’d like.
Louise smiles reassuringly.
Greg nods, nothing of substance to add, but-GREG POPE
We’re on an electrical grid.
James nods as though he understands that.
LOUISE POPE
Whatever rules you had before,
don’t worry about those. Things are
different here.
James scoffs nervously.
JAMES
Yeah. They are.

28.
He slips out of the room.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
James steps to the top, pauses. He hears something-Muffled SYNTH-Y music emanating from Aubrey’s room.
James takes a couple steps closer, intrigued.
Then her door handle TURNS and starts to open...
James freezes, not sure what to do.
Aubrey steps out of her room, sees him.
JAMES
Uh, sorry.
(then)
I like those rhythms.
He spins awkwardly, goes to his door, shuts himself in.
Aubrey shakes her head.
AUBREY
So weird.
JAMES’ NEW BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
James inspects his TV, Brigsby tape in hand.
But there’s nowhere to put it.
TIME CUT: James channel surfs past: an infomercial, a
military recruitment ad, a body spray commercial, C-SPAN.
He lands on a trashy E! reality show.
On screen: two women yelling at each other, followed by-REALITY TALKING HEAD
Denise needs to realize, if she
wants this restaurant to take off,
she has to play by my rules.
James turns it off. He just sits, alone, thinking...
Then the corners of his mouth turn down. His lip quivers.
Like it’s all just now starting to hit him. He shrinks back
into his bed, pulls his knees up to his chest.
OMIT
POPE HOUSEHOLD - JAMES’ BEDROOM - DAY
Daylight through the drawn shades of James’ WINDOW.
Neighborhood sounds below -- a car driving by, a dog barking.

29.
James steps over, timid. Pulls the shade aside just enough to
sneak a peak at the strange world below...
POPE HOUSEHOLD - HALLWAY - DAY
Greg Pope comes up the stairs to James’ door. He hesitates
for a moment, listening -- nothing. He knocks, concerned.
GREG POPE
James? You alright in there, bud?
You didn’t come down for breakfast.
We made a quiche. That’s like a pie
sort of, but with eggs and stuff.
A beat -- no response.
Well, hey -- I took the day off, so
I was thinking maybe we could have
some fun? I’ve got a surprise
planned. How does that sound?
Another beat, then the door CRACKS OPEN.
James peers through, intrigued...
SINGLE-SCREEN MOVIE THEATER - AFTERNOON
On the marquee: “Now Showing: Hockey High”
Greg Pope and James approach on the sidewalk.
MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
Old patterned carpet, neons, posters, displays.
James walks inside as though one might a cathedral, looking
around in awe.
James takes a line of ONE-SHEETS, carefully absorbing them as
though one might great works of art. He stops at one of a man
in drag holding up a gun and a police badge. James chuckles,
shakes his head.
Greg Pope watches him, not sure what to make of his son.
THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
James walks in, popcorn and soda in hand, looking around.
Lights DIM and the screen GLOWS. James looks up, TRANSFIXED.
Music: Treasure of the Ancients, Brigsby Vol. 12.
He drifts toward the front row. Finds a seat in the middle.
Mouth agape, glasses glowing. Religious awe.

30.
ICE-RINK - ON SCREEN (45 minutes into the movie)
Following a HELMETED KID, moving the puck down the ice,
juking some UNDERDOG HOCKEY KIDS, and scoring.
NERD HOCKEY KID
Who is this guy?
The Helmeted Kid hockey-stops, spraying up ice, then takes
off the helmet, revealing... LONG BLONDE HAIR.
A girl?

CHUBBY HOCKEY KID

The team can’t believe it!
And neither can James, in his seat, completely blown away by
this narrative development.
Whoa...

JAMES

James continues to watch, but the sound and picture FADE OUT.
FAMILIAR VOICE (O.C.)
(whispers)
James...
Did he really just hear that? James spins to find:
BRIGSBY BEAR, sitting in the seat behind him.
James can’t believe it.
JAMES
Brigsby?
(then)
You know my name?
BRIGSBY
I was transported to the inbetweenverse, James! I’m trapped!
The movie screen goes BRIGHT WHITE, illuminating-The theater, EMPTY. An otherworldly MIST rising.
James looks freaked out.
JAMES
What’s happening?
Brigsby taps his wrist transponder, producing a hologram.

31.
BRIGSBY
It’s the Pla’torians... They must
have intercepted my dimensional
transmission. We’re not safe here.
(springing up)
Follow me!
James and Brigsby run toward the movie screen.
Behind them, the PROJECTOR lens start to spin like a Gatling
gun, firing bursts of colored LASERS!
(The sound and visual effects here are of the same quality as
“Brigsby Bear Adventures.”)
Following Brigsby’s lead, James JUMPS inside-THE MOVIE SCREEN - INFINITE WHITE
They run, dodging lasers all around them.
BRIGSBY
You were right about how to defeat
the Sun Snatcher, James. But we
don’t have much time.
Brigsby starts to DISSOLVE, fading into white static.
You’re the only one who can stop
him now! Find the Sortis Crystal,
James! Find Arielle Smiles! The
fate of our world depends on it!
Brigsby disappears. COLOR returns to the world around him.
PATTERENED CARPET - MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
James stands there, catching his breath.
GREG POPE (O.S.)
James? James!
James spins to see Greg Pope running up to him, worried.
GREG POPE
Are you okay?
James smiles, still processing it.
JAMES
Okay? That was amazing!

32.
GREG POPE
You started running around,
shouting some kind of... weird
stuff pretty loudly?
JAMES
Yeah it was so fun!
Greg Pope touches his hand to James’ forehead.
GREG POPE
You feel okay? You don’t have a
fever or anything?
JAMES
I feel great.
(to everyone in the lobby)
I love movies!
EMILY’S OFFICE - MORNING
Big, bright and pleasant.
James sits on the couch, exuberance unabated.
Flanking him are Greg and Louise Pope, smiling hopefully.
JAMES
..and remember when the ice
warriors got their new armor? And
the one with the glasses -- the
Little Eddie? -- when it was too
big, it didn’t even fit?
Across from them in a chair: EMILY. Expression warm.
Oh! And when the one called Gordo
ate all that cake and slipped and
fell on his backside?
(to Greg Pope)
Remember?
GREG POPE
Sure, yeah. Pretty funny...
JAMES
Yeah, it was different from Brigsby
‘cause there weren't any spells and
it was only one adventure, but the
screen was so big!
Louise wants to respond but hesitates, looking to Emily for
the okay. Emily nods.

33.
LOUISE POPE
That sounds so cool, and so big,
but hey -- since you brought up
Brigsby, maybe that’s something we
should all talk about?
EMILY
I think that’s a great idea. Thank
you, Mrs. Pope.
JAMES
Wait, who are you?
She smiles, patient.
EMILY
My name’s Emily, remember?
JAMES
No, I know, but what’s-(gestures vaguely)
--this? Having a meeting with you,
here? What’s going on?
EMILY
Well, James, since you’re going
through such a confusing transition
at the moment, your parents and I
thought it might help if I dropped
by every once a while so we could
just... talk.
JAMES
About movies?
EMILY
Sure. Or, you know, any emotions
you might be experiencing, trying
to adapt to a very new, very
different environment. And, hey -She shrugs like it’s a chill plan off the top of her head.
...develop a plan to help you
through it.
JAMES
Okay, but why, though?
EMILY
Because... that’s what I do; I help
people.

34.
James rolls his eyes, frustrated.
JAMES
Everyone says they’re trying to
help me, but nobody can find the
new episode of Brigsby!
EMILY
(choosing her words)
Right. Let’s take a step back.
Let’s talk about Brigsby Bear
Adventures.
JAMES
Wait, you know it?
EMILY
Your parents and I have learned
quite a lot about it, actually.
Including some things that you
should know.
James tilts his head, intrigued.
Like what?

JAMES

EMILY
First of all, there wasn’t a new
Brigsby this week.
James looks between Greg and Louise Pope, unsure.
JAMES
That’s... impossible.
EMILY
James, the way you were raised, you
didn’t even realize you were being
held captive. And these people you
thought were your parents -- you
need to understand, these were not
good people. They went to great
lengths to placate you, but it was
all just... an elaborate illusion.
Does that make sense?
James twists his face up skeptically.

35.
JAMES
Uh... I know that this society is
kind of different from what they
said, but... What does that have to
do with Brigsby?
EMILY
Let’s take a step back here, James.
Now, the way the police found you
was, someone spotted Ted going into
a warehouse about 40 miles away
from where he was holding you
captive. The day they came to get
you, they also went into that
warehouse. Inside, they found
props, puppets, costumes and a
television set of a cabin. Do you
see where I’m going with this?

James eyes go wide.
JAMES
Brigsby stuff?
EMILY
From what we can tell-JAMES
(excited)
My dad actually got to go there?
Greg Pope’s thrown off by that phrasing...
EMILY
James, Ted Mitchum -- your captor -he went there several times a week.
He was the one making the show.
James works it through. His eyes go somewhere distant.
James?
He snaps out of it, finds the words-JAMES
(psyched)
Yes! He knows Brigsby--? I mean, he
made it? That’s... that’s great!
Louise Pope looks between Greg Pope and Emily, unsure. Uh-oh.

36.
GREG POPE
Um, James -- I think you’re missing
the larger context here-JAMES
Cameras and characters?
EMILY
There’s still a lot we’re trying to
figure out, but-JAMES
Hold on... He was the one who
decided what Brigsby would do next?
EMILY
That’s right.
JAMES
Have they decided who’s going to
take over doing it?
EMILY
(?)
No one’s “taking over doing it.”
You’re the only one who’s ever seen
this show.
JAMES
But I have friends who watched it,
on the Brigsby fan forum, on my
computer?
EMILY
Well, the computer at your old
house was running on a closed
network, so any content there we
can assume was created by Ted and
April.
JAMES
You mean BrigsbyBoy1, BrigsbyBoy2,
BrigsbyBoy3 -- they weren’t real?
EMILY
I’m sorry, James. No.
James thinks a beat...
JAMES
What about BrigsbyGirl?

37.
Emily looks a tad incredulous. She gestures “sorry.”
James is bummed. A little embarrassed.
We were gonna meet up someday...
James readjusts on the couch. Sinks into it.
EMILY
I know this isn’t easy, James. And
there are going to be strong
emotions associated with this. Like
today, when you were overstimulated
at the movie theater. But that’s
why I’m here, to help you figure
things out.
LOUISE POPE
That’s right, sweetie. And we’re
excited to help, too! We’re gonna
have so much fun together, getting
you back on track, you won’t even
remember some old TV show.
James doesn’t respond, lost in his thoughts.
EMILY
What do you think, James? Do you
have any other questions?
JAMES
Yeah -- who made Hockey High?
Emily wasn’t expecting that. She looks to Greg Pope.
GREG POPE
Um... I think it’s the guy who did
“Mr. Bachelor,” right? Is that what
it was called?
Louise shrugs.
JAMES
Does he do all the movies?
GREG POPE
Uh, no -- lots of people make lots
of different movies.
A beat as James considers that, putting something together...
JAMES
Can anyone do it?

38.

The BRIGSBY THEME begins to build, carrying to-OMIT
JAMES’ ROOM - NIGHT
DOOR: closed. LAPTOP: open.
James sits, eyes fixed with purpose. He Googles:
“how... to... make... a... movie... show”
His finger hovers over the ENTER key, drops.
ON SCREEN: A super fast-forward of James’ internet deep dive:
film history, stars, equipment, studios, sets, effects.
James’ eyes dart, consuming everything.
JAMES’ ROOM - DAY
James drops a stack of LIBRARY BOOKS on his desk:
“Film Directing.” “The Art of Storyboarding”
“The North American Grizzly Bear.”
LATER -- James closes the grizzly book with a THUD.
Worthless. Moves it aside, grabs “Practical Visual Effects.”
JAMES’ ROOM - NIGHT
James finishes a crude STORYBOARD on notebook paper:
Brigsby jumping off a cloud, a Sun Soldier chasing him.
James tapes it to the wall, next to several others.
We TRACK along the length of the wall, revealing-The room is COVERED in storyboards, floor to ceiling.
James leans back in his chair, assessing it all, proud.
There’s a KNOCK, and he turns to his door. Opens it to find:
AUBREY, who doesn’t look very happy.
AUBREY
(forced)
Hey.
James stands there, unsure whether to respond.
Aubrey rolls her eyes.

39.
AUBREY
So, I’m going to our school’s
football game with some people, and
if you want to come with me, to
that, you’re invited.
(lower, a suggestion)
But you definitely don’t have to,
if you’re too busy, sleeping, or...
(looks into his room)
decorating, or whatever it is
you’ve been doing in here.
James tilts his head, confused.
JAMES
Is that the thing with the mask
guys, they get mad at each other?
AUBREY
Yeah, it’s pretty stupid.
JAMES
So, should I-- You do want me to
come to it?
LOUISE POPE (O.S.)
(listening from the
stairs)
Aubrey...
AUBREY
(sighs)
Yeah, I guess.
AUBREY’S SHITTY MAZDA - NIGHT
Parked at the curb of another house.
Aubrey sits driver, finishing a text. James in the back.
AUBREY
So, look... mom and dad said I had
to invite you, because you’ve been
in your room so much, and they
think you should socialize with
people, or whatever. Also, they
threatened to take my car away,
which is some bullshit, but.
On James, in the BACK SEAT.
JAMES
“Bullshit?”

40.
AUBREY
Bullshit. Yes.
JAMES
Oh.
AUBREY
We’re not going to the game.
JAMES
We’re not?
AUBREY
This kid’s parents are out of town,
so a bunch of people are hanging
out. It’s not a big deal, but for
some reason, Greg and Louise always
freak out, just because of this one
time the cops came and I had to go
to a court thing.
James stares back at her, confused.
Do not stare at people like that
when we’re there, okay? Be normal.
(James adopts a “normal”
posture)
And don’t tell anyone how old you
are. Or that we’re related.
JAMES
Should... I go back to my room?
AUBREY
What did I just tell you? They
think we’re going to the game and
getting food after.
(off his uncertainty)
It’ll be like four, five hours max.
The passenger door opens and MERIDETH gets in.
MERIDETH
What’s up what’s up...
AUBREY
Hey, sorry.

41.
MERIDETH
It’s cool.
(turning, to James)
Hey, I’m Merideth.
James tenses up.
Hi...

JAMES

AUBREY
That’s James.
MERIDETH
Yeah, I saw you on the news, man.
Crazy.
She shoves him playfully. He’s not sure what to say.
So... You like Cedar Hills?
James thinks about it. Offers-JAMES
I like movies.
Merideth LAUGHS.
MERIDETH
Yeah, exactly.
PRELAP: bass-heavy PARTY JAMS.
HOUSE PARTY - LAWN
Teenagers approaching from all directions.
Cars choke the street and driveway.
James follows Aubrey and Merideth, nervous. Aubrey turns-AUBREY
Just... do your own thing, okay?
Before James can put together a response, they’re-INSIDE
The MUSIC. The CROWD. Yelling, laughing, swarming.
Merideth and Aubrey say hi (ad-lib) to some friends.
James watches a couple DANCING, trying to make sense of it.
Yo!

SPENCER

42.
SPENCER (18) weaves through the crowd, hands up for double
high-fives.
Finally!
I know...

AUBREY

Aubrey reciprocates. Merideth medium-fives him, less into it.
James clocks: he has a SPACESHIP on his shirt.
SPENCER
So, what’s up?
AUBREY
(walking past him)
Just, you know, doing shit...
Spencer nods, sincere.
SPENCER
Right on.
(after her)
Keg’s in the kitchen!
MERIDETH
Spence, you got any shit on you?
SPENCER
I don’t, but Logan’s around
somewhere.
MERIDETH
Tight. Who are these people?
She squeezes past him.
SPENCER
Alright, see you out there.
Then Spencer sees: James standing a few feet way, unsure.
SPENCER
Hey man. Spencer.
James stares a beat, nervous. Then, too-quiet-JAMES
Is that some kinda Bear Speeder?
SPENCER
(leans in)
What’s that?

43.
Another song comes on, LOUDER. James steps over-JAMES
(yells)
That some kinda Bear Speeder or
Stealodrone Rider? On your shirt?
SPENCER
Oh, yeah, dude, some Trek shit.
James nods.
JAMES
I’m James.
(then)
My parents stole me, but I still
think they were pretty cool.
SPENCER
Tight... You need a beer?
HOUSE PARTY - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
PACKED with people, wall-to-wall, orbiting the keg.
James navigates the mess, timid, following Spencer.
SQUEEZES around a couple making out against the wall.
Spencer sees a FRIEND preparing to do a keg-stand, and
another filming it on his phone.
SPENCER
Send me that! I need that!
The crowd SURGES and cheers as the keg-stand begins, forcing
James back against the wall.
CROWD
Co-ry! Co-ry! CO-RY!
Then into the corner. Trapped.
He sees an OPEN DOOR and ducks for it, panicked. Escapes to-BACK DECK - CONTINUOUS
James stumbles outside, shuts the door behind him.
Smaller crowd out here, quieter. He catches his breath.
Sits at the patio table, surveys the scene-On the other side of the deck: a couple BROS eye him.
One says something to the other. They LAUGH.

44.
James doesn’t know what to do, so-JAMES
(loud)
I’m James... Really great clothes!
The bros laugh even harder. James turns away, embarrassed.
He takes a deep breath, uneasy.
Spencer steps outside, red cups in hand.
SPENCER
Hey man. Everything cool?
JAMES
Yeah... just meeting some people.
Spencer notices the bros, continuing to laugh.
SPENCER
Oh... Yeah, man -- I don’t even
know who those dudes are, but they
look like dicks.
JAMES
Yeah...?
SPENCER
Totally. Don’t even worry about it.
James nods, relaxing a bit. Smiles.
JAMES
I said I like their clothes, but
really I like my clothes a bit
more.
Spencer laughs.
SPENCER
Yeah, totally, man that shirt’s
hilarious.
Spencer hands James a beer.
So... You’re Aubrey’s... brother,
person, right?
James considers whether to answer...
(MORE)

45.
SPENCER (CONT'D)
I heard you were basically inside
one house, like, your whole life?
James shrugs, guarded.
JAMES
I went on the roof sometimes.
SPENCER
(smiles)
Nice, man. Good call.
Spencer raises his cup. James mimics him.
Cheers, dude. To, uh...
(thinks about it)
Have you seen porn yet?
(off his confusion)
To pornography. And videogames. And
like, millions of other... awesome
shit.
JAMES
Yes, to all those... things.
They SIP. And James immediately SPRAYS it everywhere.
Spencer LAUGHS, wiping himself off.
SPENCER
Oh, shit! Sorry, man. That’s cool.
JAMES
I thought it was like soda.
James clears his throat, determined. Tries another gulp.
COUGHS it up.
BACK DECK - LATER
Fully raging, music LOUDER. A few other people stand around
James and Spencer, drinking, smoking. Including Merideth and
LOGAN, extremely high, digging through a baggie of pills.
James looks looser now. Buzzed, likely.
JAMES
(rattles off)
...but this is before the collapse
of the third federation, where
everything changes, and Brigsby
becomes an outlaw. But he’s still a
good guy, even though he has to
work with the Stardust Bandits.

46.
LOGAN
Wait, what are we even talking
about here -- like, a trained bear?
JAMES
Yeah, Brigsby? He’s trained in
space combat, puzzle-solving,
quests. And I guess he also allows
you to be the best version of
yourself via a series of
instructional life lessons. Plus,
did I tell you about the rainbow
eyes?
MERIDETH
How do the rainbow eyes work?
JAMES
Oh, great question. they’re just -whenever you need a rainbow.
MERIDETH
(smiles at him)
That’s insane. I love it.
Logan offers the baggie to Spencer, deep in thought.
SPENCER
Oh, I’m good man.
(passes it)
So, okay -- how many episodes?
JAMES
25 volumes, 736 episodes, total.
SPENCER
Holy shit...
JAMES
Yeah, I’ve got some old tapes if
you ever want to see it?
SPENCER
Dude, yes! That’d be dope as shit.
JAMES
Yes, it’s... dope as shit.
JAMES
And then there’s gonna be a movie
too, but it’s not done yet, ‘cause
I’m making it and I just started.

47.
SPENCER
Whoa, seriously? Cool. Are you
gonna use all the original shit?
James considers that...
MERIDETH
(re: baggie)
Hey James, you want one?
Yes!
Do this--

JAMES
MERIDETH

She sticks out her tongue. James does it too. She places the
pills, swallows, and James follows suit.
JAMES
Thank you. I love opto-pills.
Merideth laughs, gives him a HUG.
HOUSE PARTY - LIVING ROOM - 30-45 MINUTES LATER
MUSIC UP. Merideth and James dance among the partiers,
exuberant. But James looks a little unstable, overwhelmed.
Freaking out, senses overwhelmed. She leads him to-HOUSE PARTY - EMPTY GUEST ROOM - MINUTES LATER
Merideth opens the door, holding James’ hand, leading him
inside. She sits him down on the edge of the bed.
MERIDETH
There you go. Here, drink this.
She hands him a glass of water, sits next to him.
A beat of silence... Muffled MUSIC from the other room.
James struggles to keep his eyelids open, mind racing.
MERIDETH
Don’t worry, my first time rolling
was intense too. But once you just
relax and go with it, you’re good.
James nods, unsure. More silence.
There’s probably a lot of stuff
you’ve never done, huh?

48.
JAMES
Yeah, I guess.
MERIDETH
Have you ever been with a girl?
JAMES
(unsure)
Oh, yeah, on the internet, but it
was actually just my first parents
playing tricks on me.
MERIDETH
(smiles)
You’re like, an actual interesting
person.
JAMES
Oh...
MERIDETH
Everyone around here is like, the
same. Boring, you know?
James nods, uncomfortable. Merideth looks at him, smiles...
Then she leans in and KISSES James, spilling his water.
Stunned, he sort of kisses her back, heart pounding.
Merideth runs her hand down to James’ waistline, reaches into
his pants... James doesn’t know what to do so he awkwardly
puts his hands in the air.
JAMES
Uh... Thank you. That’s very nice.
Then the world SLOWS DOWN. Sounds get murkier, objects
blurrier. James looks around, dazed, freaking out.
Then he springs up-JAMES
Okay, bye.
--and exits the room.
HOUSE PARTY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
James stumbles out, zipping up his pants, falling awkwardly
into the wall. It catches the attention of-AUBREY
James.

49.
She comes over, helps him stabilize.
Whoa, hey, you need to chill, okay?
You’re embarrassing me right now.
JAMES
Okay, sorry...
James pushes past her, heads to the-BACK PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
James runs through the crowd, past Spencer, and jumps off the
porch into the grass.
SPENCER
Yo, James, where are you going?
JAMES
Thanks for beer!
He runs into the backyard, disappears into the trees.
SPENCER
What the hell...?
JAMES, RUNNING - CONTINUOUS
He dodges branches and jumps shrubbery, on a mission.
Music: The Festival Fortuno, Brigsby Vol. 20.
Then James comes upon a CLEARING in the trees...
He slows down, stops. Looks around. Erie, moon-lit.
James treads carefully.
SPENCER (O.S.)
James! Hold on, man...!
James turns, listens... He hears far-off DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER.
Getting louder and louder until-SUN SNATCHER
James!
Above a small hill, THE SUN SNATCHER appears in the sky!
His treacherous voice BOOMS-Where are you even going, man?
James backs away, terrified.

50.
JAMES
Sun Snatcher!
He turns, RUNS.
SUN SNATCHER
(laughing)
How are you possibly this wasted
right now?
James keeps going.
SUN SNATCHER
Dude, did you get dome from
Merideth?
JAMES
Stay away from me, Snatcher!
He TRIPS down a small hill into a mound of dirt. He’s clearly
fine, but he flails around dramatically.
Oh no! Tricksand!
(to himself)
Gotta find something to hold onto!
Off the high tension of this cliffhanger-JAMES - SHOOTS AWAKE! - MORNING
He sits up, panicked. He calms down, realizes-He’s on a COUCH, in a bedroom that isn’t his.
Around the room: empty bottles and red cups, comic and movie
art, framed posters, books, and even a small shelf of cool
ACTION FIGURES...
SPENCER is on his laptop, editing PARTY FOOTAGE with music
and meme-type. James watches the screen a moment, intrigued.
JAMES
Where am I?
Spencer turns around, sees him.
SPENCER
Oh, hey, man... You’re still at my
place. Aubrey handled it with your
parents, so all good.

51.
JAMES
What happened?
SPENCER
Well, you tried to drink beer. Then
you started taking molly and you
got pretty lit.
James rubs his eyes, looks into the adjacent BATHROOM.
Where we see BRIGSBY, kneeling next to the toilet, vomiting.
JAMES
(snapping out of it)
I’m really sorry, Mr. Spencer....
SPENCER
No, man -- it’s all good. You can
just call me Spence.
He gets up, looks around.
JAMES
Is this stuff from a show?
SPENCER
Ah, yeah, sort of. Shows, movies,
video games, comics.
Stops in front of Spencer’s laptop video editing screen.
JAMES
Whoa... What is this?
SPENCER
Oh, yeah, just some bullshit.
He opens another video window, clicks play.
I also do, like, time-lapse stuff.
ON SCREEN: A sunset, then a whirl of darkening colors as the
camera tilts skyward, rotating with bright starlight.
James stares at the screen, blown away.
SPENCER
Yeah, I don’t know, I’m still
learning. Might do some stuff with
it in college, maybe. I don’t know.
Anyway...
(closes the laptop)
So wait, dude -- did you hook up
with Merideth though, or what?

52.
JAMES
Oh, I don’t know... She put the
hand inside of the pants?
SPENCER
What! She is hot, dude! That’s
sick!
JAMES
(bashful-brag)
Yeah, we liked it.
Spencer CRACKS UP.
SPENCER’S TRUCK - POPE DRIVEWAY - MORNING
James hands Spencer a stack of TAPES through his window.
JAMES
So, these are in order from volume
14 to 20 -- that’s when it started
to get really good. And these ones
are... I guess, they’re my
favorites.
Spencer inspects one of the cases.
SPENCER
Whoa, is Donald Duck in this shit?
Spencer indicates a weird Donald Duck knockoff on the cover,
in a spacecraft.
JAMES
What? No, that’s Goody Goose. He’s
the top pilot in the Starsquad
Alliance.
SPENCER
Oh. Well, he looks a lot like
Donald Duck.
(off James)
He’s a popular cartoon character.
JAMES
It’s not. It’s Goody Goose.
SPENCER
Right on...
(then)
(MORE)

53.
SPENCER (CONT'D)
Well hey, dude -- it was cool
meeting you. Good luck with... you
know, the world and everything.
JAMES
Yeah... Thanks.
SPENCER
I’ll just give these back to Aub or
whatever. Cool?
James nods, unsure.
Cool...

JAMES

Spencer waves, drives off. James watches him go.
POLICE STATION - DET. VOGEL’S OFFICE - DAY
Vogel, at his desk, reviewing a document.
James sits across from him, waiting patiently.
VOGEL
So, James -- what’s this for,
exactly?
JAMES
It’s a list of everything for the
Brigsby movie I’m making? I need
all the cameras from my old dad’s
Brigsby set, all the props and
costumes and stuff. Oh -- also, I
need to find the Smiles Sisters,
whoever they are in real life. And
whoever did the voice of Brigsby
Bear, obviously.
(off his hesitation)
You guys have all the stuff, right?
DET. VOGEL
We do, yes -- but it’s evidence in
an ongoing investigation.
JAMES
Okay, so... after that?
DET. VOGEL
After that, it’s police property.
James hesitates, frustrated. Finds the words.

54.
JAMES
But... the story of Brigsby Bear
isn’t finished, and I’m the only
one who knows what’s going on. I
have to finish it.
Vogel half-smiles, apologetic.
DET. VOGEL
I’m sorry, James. It’s just... we
have rules here.
James reaches into his pocket, places two dollars and 35
cents on the desk. Vogel looks at James, confused.
JAMES
Why don’t we keep this between you
me?
(off his confusion)
I saw it on a TV.
DET. VOGEL
I can’t accept that.
POLICE STATION - LOBBY - LATER
Vogel exits his office holding a sack lunch.
As he walks through the lobby, he’s confused by-JAMES, clearly, sitting in a chair, “reading” a D.A.R.E.
brochure, holding it up to obscure his face.
As Vogel exits, James lowers the brochure and stealthily
follows behind.
POLICE STATION - LAWN - MOMENTS LATER
Vogel sits a public bench, eating a homemade sandwich.
James, behind a nearby tree that doesn’t quite conceal him,
waits for the right moment... and CRUNCHES a branch under his
sneaker. Vogel turns his head.
VOGEL
James... Still hanging around, huh?
James steps over, timid.
JAMES
Um, so, I just... I feel like maybe
I wasn’t clear, earlier, about what
I’m really trying to do here?

55.
He sits down next to Vogel.
JAMES
How can I explain this in a way you
would understand...?
(passionate)
Try to imagine a hero. And he’s not
on the bad side, he’s on the good
side. But he wants to go against a
guy who is on the bad side. So he
goes on... an adventure. Best part
is, it’s not even on a TV... It’s
on a screen so big, you feel like
you’re in another world. That’s how
I got the idea to make... a movie!
VOGEL
Yeah... No, I understand what
movies are. And I think it’s great
to be creative. I actually
performed in plays in high school.
(proud)
Prospero. The Tempest.
James just looks at him.
I pray thee. Mark me! That a
brother could be so... perfidious.
(then)
I’m not sure how the rest goes.
JAMES
Whoa... That was very good.
VOGEL
Thank you.
JAMES
Do you do shows?
VOGEL
Oh, no. I don’t act anymore. I’m
just saying, I get what you’re
trying to do, and I wish I could
help, but-JAMES
Why?
VOGEL
Why what?

56.
JAMES
Don’t you do it any more?
VOGEL
Act?
Vogel thinks about it, shrugs.
You grow up, things change. You
move on. I do this now.
James nods, but looks bummed out by that explanation.
JAMES
That’s really sad that you didn't
get to do what was important to
you... Bye.
James turns, mopes away.
Off Vogel, alone with his sandwich, considering that.
A DARK SPACE - LATER
Lights kick on, revealing a large POLICE STORAGE CLOSET
overflowing with BRIGSBY STUFF: boxes, costumes, robotic
parts, props, cameras.
VOGEL walks in, stops in front of a shelf, pulls from it a
prop SUN SOLDIER HELMET. Cool... He tries it on.
The DOOR OPENS behind him.
BANDER
(suspicious)
Detective...?
Vogel turns to Bander, takes off the helmet.
VOGEL
Yep... everything’s here.
OMIT
POPE HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Sunny, clean. James and Louise Pope sit on adjacent couches.
Iced LEMONADES on coasters.
Louise organizes BOOKS and LIBRARY DVDs on the coffee table.

57.
LOUISE POPE
(bright enthusiasm)
Well! I’m so glad you had fun and
met new people last night.
JAMES
(disinterested)
Yeah...
LOUISE POPE
But I want this to feel like fun
too. So you don’t have to be stuck
with some boring tutor. This way we
can enjoy each other’s company, and
go at our own pace, and learn about
whatever you want to learn about.
All James can muster is a polite sort-of smile.
LOUISE POPE
So, what do you think? World
Geography? European history? The
Bible?
James considers it...
JAMES
Can I learn how to pilot a car?
LOUISE POPE
Huh... you know, I don’t see why
not. We’d have to get you a
learner’s permit..
Greg Pope, listening in from the kitchen:
GREG POPE
Hey, that could be fun.
He joins them in the room.
There’s a couple classes you’re
supposed to take, and a written
test, but I could take you out,
show you the ropes?
Just then, the DOORBELL rings. James turns, curious.
FRONT DOOR - OPENS
It’s DETECTIVE VOGEL. In jeans and a tee-shirt, cheery.
James, holding the door, looks surprised.

58.
DET. VOGEL
James Pope -- just the man I was
looking for.
JAMES
Where’s your soldier stuff?
DET. VOGEL
My--? Oh, I’m off duty.
He sees Greg Pope, behind James, smiles hello.
Mr. Pope. Hope I’m not bothering
you. Just wanted to say hi to
James, talk about a... matter we
discussed earlier.
Off James, intrigued.
POPE DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
James follows Vogel to his Subaru Station Wagon.
Greg Pope follows, curious.
DET. VOGEL
So, look... Obviously, there’s no
way I can get all that stuff you
wanted. But, forensics has more
evidence coming in than they know
what to do with, and there’s no way
anyone’s gonna notice a couple
items.
Vogel opens his hatchback, filled with boxes. He pulls out-A cheap looking CRYSTAL NECKLACE. James’ eyes alight.
JAMES
The Sortis Crystal?!
James looks at Greg Pope, amazed. He isn’t sure how to react.
DET. VOGEL
And I know this wasn’t on your
list, but...
He pulls out MAGIC STAFF.
JAMES
Bortep’s staff? I thought it was
lost in a time flux...

59.
DET. VOGEL
Ha, yeah. Check it out -- if you
hit this switch on the back...
It LIGHTS UP! Vogel spins it around, gesturing dramatically.
GREG POPE
(takes a step back)
Whoa...
DET. VOGEL
How great is that? Got a nice
weight to it, too.
He sets it aside, goes back into the trunk...
And last but not least, saw a few
of these bad boys laying around...
...and pulls out BRIGSBY BEAR’S BIG PUPPET HEAD!
The exact one from the show. Whoa.
JAMES
(might pass out)
That’s Brigsby...
DET. VOGEL
Yeah, I kind of assumed.
Vogel hands it to James, who receives it with great care.
James feels Brigsby’s fur. Closes and opens his eyes.
He looks between Vogel and Greg Pope, speechless.
JAMES
Is this... I mean -- I can have it?
DET. VOGEL
You can hang onto it, for right
now. I’m not technically supposed
to be doing this, so nothing in
public, okay?
James nods, overjoyed. Not sure how best to express his
gratitude, he tries that Spencer thing and raises his hand.
DET. VOGEL
Do you have a question?
(realizes)
Oh, high five? Sure, okay. I’ll
high-five on that.
They connect a solid one.

60.
JAMES
Thank you! Dope as shit.
DET. VOGEL
(slightly confused)
You’re welcome.
JAMES
(to Greg Pope)
Pretty dope as shit.
GREG POPE
Sure, yeah. Very dope.
Greg Pope watches as James runs inside. He turns to Vogel,
hesitates a beat.
DET. VOGEL
Uh, again, sorry if I was
interrupting something, or-GREG POPE
Oh, not at all. But I will say,
it’s just -- well, you know, this
transition we’re going through, it
hasn’t exactly been easy. As I’m
sure you know.
DET. VOGEL
Of course. I’m just trying to help
out any way I can.
GREG POPE
You know, that’s the thing -actually. This “Brigsby”
business... I realize James is a
fan, but all this stuff -- it’s not
just collector’s items we’re
talking about here. These are tools
that a very sick person used to
imprison my son.
Vogel looks taken aback.
DET. VOGEL
Right, of course. I just thought -he asked me for some help on this
movie he’s making, and I just
figured, you know...
Greg Pope looks confused at that.

61.
GREG POPE
He’s making a movie?
OMIT
OMIT
THE BRIGSBY HEAD - COUCH - MINUTES LATER
Worn fur, imperfect hand stitching, eyes half-closed.
Hear a CLICK, then soft TAPE STATIC...
Followed by scratchy BRIGSBY DIALOGUE.
The EYES and SNOUT come alive! Moving along with the words.
On the back: Gears spin on a built-in TAPE DECK.
WIDER we see:
James, excited, shows Greg and Louise Pope how it works-JAMES
See -- you just press play, and it
moves to the sound!
The Brigsby Head stops talking. Just STATIC from the tape.
Louise Pope smiles, wanting to match James’ excitement, but
not quite sure what to make of it. Greg looks concerned.
LOUISE POPE
Well, that is... something, huh?
Then it starts up again. James watches, entranced.
BRIGSBY HEAD (TAPE)
We know what he have to do! But
there’s only one way into The
Forbidden Forest...
JAMES
Oh! I know this one-JAMES
We have to pass through the
core of the planet!

BRIGSBY HEAD
We have to travel through the
core of the planet.

The Brigsby Head stops again. James doesn’t break his gaze.
JAMES
(filling in Arielle’s
missing dialogue)
But isn’t that -- that’s where’s
the fire gods live? The fire realm?

*
*
*

62.
BRIGSBY HEAD (TAPE)
Yes. But we must make peace with
The Gods of the Fire -- for the
sake of both our worlds.
But then James notices Greg Pope’s expression. He drops his
smile, self-conscious. Presses STOP on the tape.
JAMES
So, anyway... Maybe we could do the
studies some other time? I think
I’m just gonna go to my room for
the rest of the day.
LOUISE POPE
(disappointed)
Oh... Well, we don’t have to study
right now if you don’t want.
She stands up.
LOUISE POPE
Are you hungry? I could make you a
sandwich? And we could listen to
some more Briggles Bear? Maybe you
could tell me more about him?
GREG POPE
Or we could take a look at the
list? It is Saturday after all -still plenty of time for some fun.
But James is already on his way out of the room.
JAMES
Uh... No thanks.
Greg Pope and Louise watches him go, dispirited.
JAMES’ BEDROOM - EVENING
James, on his bed, wearing the Brigsby Head, getting a feel
for it. He timidly “acts” along with Brigsby’s voice.
Then there’s a KNOCK and his door opens.
It’s Aubrey, who of course SCREAMS.
AUBREY
Jesus... What the hell?
James reaches behind the head, clicks “STOP.”

63.
JAMES
It’s me, James!
(taking it off)
Not a real bear.
AUBREY
Why can’t you just be normal?
JAMES
Remember? I was kidnapped.
AUBREY
No, I know. I just-- This whole
thing is weird enough without you
trying to hang out with people,
embarrassing me in front of my
friends.
(then)
Oh, also, everyone’s saying you
hooked up with Merideth? Do not do
that. That is disgusting.
(tosses him her phone)
And tell mom you need your own
phone.
James looks at the phone, confused. Caller ID says “Spencer.”
James doesn’t know what to do with it.
AUBREY
Talk.
JAMES
(holding phone up in front
of him)
Hello?
Frustrated, Aubrey walks over, guides the phone to his ear.
JAMES
Oh...
AUBREY
(leaving)
Put it outside my room when you’re
done.
SPENCER (PHONE)
Duuuuude.

64.
JAMES
Spencer?
(to Aubrey)
It’s Spencer!
Aubrey shakes her head, almost smiles despite herself.
TACO STAND - NIGHT
James and Spencer share a small outside table, burritos.
SPENCER
Okay, first of all -- that last
episode where Brigsby is on that
ice planet?
James nods knowingly, an excited smile on his face.
Right as they realize the
federation is invading...
JAMES
Mmmhmm -- Brigsby reveals the moon
base...
SPENCER
Yes, dude! That was so awesome! How
it just appears over the horizon,
all lit up?
JAMES
Yeah. “Hope is not yet lost!”
(then)
That’s what he says.
SPENCER
Yeah, the whole thing is like this
insane piece of art. It's like a
whole TV show made in a bedroom.
And all those characters and
effects and shit are crazy... like
that icicle bicycle thing -- how'd
he even build that? And then at the
end of the episode, when the peace
treaty goes into effect, Snatcher
melts it? That was like, really
good storytelling.
He notices James eyes WELLING...
Uh, you okay, man?
James takes a second, emotional. Smiles.

65.
JAMES
Yeah, it’s just... that was one of
my very favorite parts.
STREET - MINUTES LATER
James and Spencer walk to his truck.
SPENCER
The only thing I didn’t really get
was all the weird math shit...
JAMES
Yeah, I never liked that stuff. My
version’s not gonna have any.
SPENCER
So, are you staying with the same
story, or a new one?
JAMES
Basically just where the show left
off -- Snatcher’s more powerful
than ever, the old alliances are
broken and the galaxy’s on the edge
of destruction. And Brigsby’s the
only one who can save it.
SPENCER
Right on... So, what happens?
JAMES’ BEDROOM - LATER
James and Spencer stand before James’ story-boarded wall.
JAMES
(quick, excited)
Okay, first, Pla’torian raiders
come in on their lightships, to
Brigsby’s cabin in the desert -where he’s lived his whole life -and they take his bear parents
prisoner. Then they bring him to a
new world he never even knew
existed: The Future Light Fortress.
Everything is big and shiny and
different. No one knows who he is,
and he doesn’t know them.
James takes him through it left to right...
At first Brigsy has to live with a
king, and a queen, and a princess.
(MORE)

66.
JAMES (CONT'D)
But they’re actually Sun Soldiers,
so Brigsby can’t trust them. Then,
it gets complicated...
Pieces of the story dissolve into each other, overlapping-He has to escape the palace...
travel to Forever Mountain to get
the Sortis Crystal... finds the
Smiles Sisters... and for the first
time ever, Brigsby defeats Sun
Snatcher, once and for all.
(catches breath)
And, maybe, at some point he gets
his mom and dad out of space jail,
because what they did isn’t so bad.
Spencer looks overwhelmed, absorbing it all.
James nervously awaits his reaction...
SPENCER
(delighted)
This is insane, dude.
James isn’t sure how to take that.
I mean, like, awesome insane.
Spencer picks up the BRIGSBY HEAD, takes a closer look.
Also pretty crazy though.
James nods, relieved.
Thanks.

JAMES

SPENCER
Have you started shooting it?
JAMES
It’s my first movie, so I don’t
really know how.
SPENCER
Well, I’ve got a camera, dude. And
some of these scenes you can do
with like, a couple setups, natural
light. Do the sound later. Like-He points out a storyboard.

67.
SPENCER
Brigsby’s the only one in this
scene, right? We could do that
tomorrow.
James looks over at him, cautiously excited.
Really?

JAMES

SPENCER
Yeah, there’s a place that looks
just like that, hour and a half
away. And this stuff-(pulls out his phone)
--see, this is just green screen
and some props. Easy.
James regards the Brigsby video on Spencer’s phone,
struggling to comprehend how Brigsby Bear Adventures episode
6, Vol. 20 is contained within it.
JAMES
How’d he get in there?
SPENCER
Oh, yeah -- I put everything
online. I’ll send you the links.
Figured since you don’t have a VCR.
It's already got like 200 views.
JAMES
Wait -- so, there’s other, real
people watching Brigsby?
SPENCER
Yeah man. People are gonna want to
see this, too. I think it’s
awesome. We just have to figure out
the rest of the costume.
James is too excited about all this to even process it.
JAMES
But... you really want to do this?
Spencer considers it, genuine.
SPENCER
Yeah, man. I guess it’s been pretty
chill, hanging out, or whatever.
Brigsby, dude. I’m in.

68.
James smiles, touched...
SPENCER
Also, I’m getting drug tested in a
couple weeks, so I’ve just been
hanging around, bored as shit.
(another thought)
Oh, dude! And you have to start it
off with that theme song! Like dun
da-dun da...
James sings along with him, and the BRIGSBY THEME kicks in!
Feels like we should be already out on this moment but-JAMES
You’re my friend!
DESERT - DAY
Flat horizon. Waves of heat and shadow.
A SHAPE emerging from the mirage...
It’s BRIGSBY BEAR (James), in slo-mo, running toward us.
Dressed bear-head to toe in makeshift sci-fi fantasy garb.
Brigsby climbs up a ROCK FORMATION...
He summits, looks out. Mountains on the horizon.
Then he DRAMATIC-TURNS to look behind him.
Mouth closed. Eyelids lowered ever so slightly.
He raises his DIGITAL WATCH into frame. Speaks into it.
The BRIGSBY THEME continues, carrying us through-FACE-TIME CAMERA - DESERT - DAY
James, in costume minus the Brigsby Head.
Behind him, Spencer sets up a shot on a tripod.
JAMES
(into camera)
Hey everyone, James here. Day one,
Brigsby Bear Adventures, the final
chapter. And that’s why we’re gonna
take you... behind the scenes!
QUICK CUTS: James high-fiving Spencer. Running to another
location. Filming a Joshua tree.
JAMES
Look, it’s a spiker tree!

69.
SPENCER
Yeah, those are called Joshua
Trees, actually.
JAMES
Dope as shit!
James ZOOMS IN on it.
JAMES’ BEDROOM - DAY
James reads the Brigsby script into a TAPE RECORDER.
Spencer clicks a button on the back of the BRIGSBY HEAD,
ejects a cassette from the built-in deck, puts in James’.
OFFICE - DAY
A few CO-WORKERS gather around a laptop, watching an episode
of “Brigsby Bear Adventures” on YouTube.
On screen: Brigsby, in a volcano, sunglasses on, RAPPING:
BRIGSBY

listenin’
And if I don’t, I get my daily
discipline
Go to sleep
Go-go-go to sleep (close your eyes)
Go-go-go to sleep
GREEN SCREEN BACKDROP
CLOSE ON: Brigsby’s face, cycling through different bits of
dialogue and performance.
ANOTHER SETUP: Brigsby in a SCHOOL DESK, using a video game
STEERING WHEEL. Pulling a tough maneuver, losing control!
SPENCER’S TRUCK - DAY
Spencer at passenger, explains what to do.
James tries turning the key, and the ENGINE kicks on. Cool!
PARK BENCH - DAY
Two FRIENDS watch “Brigsby Bear Adventures” on a phone,
sharing earbuds.
On screen: Brigsby at a campfire with a group of Wizzles, led
by the WIZZLE PRINCE.

70.
BRIGSBY
Wizzle Prince, I’m sorry, but what
the Smiles Sisters tell you is true
-- the Quantix is lost to time.
WIZZLE PRINCE
(coughing)
Wizeeee. We thank you for your
effort, Sir Bear. It seems as if
the end of our race is upon us.
Wizeeeee.
BRIGSBY
I will miss all of you when you
pass away, even though you brought
it upon yourselves.
(to camera)
See, curiosity is an unnatural
emotion. If the Wizzles hadn’t
spent so much time seeking answers
about the world around them, they
might have had a better chance of
surviving. So long, Friends!
JOLLY MUSIC plays. Brigsby does a little JIG then touches his
WRIST TRANSPONDER, which teleports him away.
The Wizzle Prince COUGHS, then falls over, dead.

We’ve been practicing all day, and
hopefully we’re ready, because the
sun’s almost down, and that’s when
it’s time to have a justice duel.
SALT FLAT - DUSK
Smoke machine SMOKE billows across the fairway.
A lit-up Storm Soldier (Logan) emerges. Looks pretty cool.
Brigsby and the Storm Soldier engage in choreographed battle.
GOOGLE SEARCH BAR - “HOW TO MAKE A GOOD EXPLOSION THANK YOU”
HARDWARE STORE - DAY
James, wearing his Brigsby shirt, loads FERTILIZER into a
shopping cart, while Louise Pope adds potted flowers.
LOUISE POPE
Is that everything?
JAMES
(lying)
Yep, this is everything I need for
my new garden.
An EXCITED MAN approaches them.
EXCITED MAN
Excuse me, are you--? You’re the
bear guy, right?
(off James) )
Dude -- I saw your shirt, and -You’re the guy, right?
(MORE)

72.
EXCITED MAN (CONT'D)
Me and my friends love those
videos. They're so insane. I mean
they're awesome, but it’s like,
crazy dark and shit, you know?
Anyway-(pulls out phone)
Could I get a picture?
The excited man puts his arm around James, takes a selfie.
James smiles awkwardly, excited but unsure.
Louise smiles, but looks concerned...
EXCITED MAN
Thanks, man. Peace!
JAMES
Yes. Peace!
POLICE STATION - DET. VOGEL’S OFFICE - DAY
Vogel puts the finishing touches on some paperwork.
Then his phone BUZZES. He checks the number, intrigued...
JAMES (PRELAP)
Do you have any questions?
FACE-TIME CAMERA - POPE HOUSEHOLD - BACKYARD - DAY
JAMES
The mysterious Planet Glindos-1 was
referenced in the show, but we
never got to actually see it...
Until today!
James turns the camera to reveal: a MATTE PAINTING of his own
creation. A CAVE looking out onto a crystal world. It’s
densely detailed, but nowhere near Ted’s work.
Hmm, I wonder who might be hiding
out in the Glindos crystal-fields?
POPE HOUSEHOLD - BACKYARD - DAY
VOGEL stands in front of the Glindos-1 matte painting,
dressed in costume: a Jedi-esque HOODED ROBE.
James stands with Vogel, looking over his lines.
Spencer preps the camera.

73.
VOGEL
Just to be clear, when I say I’ve
fled to the dark corner of a lost
world, is that his own personal
world, or an actual new land?
JAMES
Um... both.
VOGEL
Okay, great, that’s what I was
thinking.
JAMES
The number one thing to remember
is, Feldo Mortese is a powerful
Bandith Warrior, but he’s sad.
That’s why he lives in a cave.
Vogel nods, confident.
VOGEL
Let’s give it a shot.
James stands back, giving Vogel some room.
VOGEL
And you’re sure your parents aren’t
coming home any time soon?
JAMES
One’s doing golf, and the other one
went out to stores. Don’t worry,
just focus on your tragic past.
Vogel takes a deep breath. He puts his hood up, hunches over
and folds his hands, physically inhabiting the character.
JAMES
And... Action.
Vogel holds for a purposeful beat, then-VOGEL
(extremely goofy accent)
My kind rose up against the one you
call Sun Snatcher. And we lost. The
few who survived, fled. And now
only I remain, cowering in a dark
corner of a lost world... waiting
for this day. The fulfillment of a
prophecy long forgotten.

74.
Spencer watches from behind the camera, transfixed but
weirded out.
VOGEL
(escalating)
You, Brigsby Bear, have been
chosen. You stand between existence
and naught.
(crescendo)
You are our last hope. Our keeper
of light!
On James, genuinely impressed. Has to compose himself.
JAMES
Cut. Perfect. Moving on!
VOGEL
Wait, that’s it?
Vogel pulls his hood down, exhilarated.
VOGEL
Can we do one more? I think there’s
another level I can get to.
JAMES
Whoa, really? Another one?
VOGEL
Definitely.
(hood back up)
You mind if I try something?
James shrugs, game.
JAMES
As long as it doesn’t violate any
sacred codes of Bandith culture,
yeah! Sure.
VOGEL
Great, thank you.
Vogel turns his back to the camera. Takes a deep breath.
SPENCER
Rolling...
A long beat as Vogel does nothing. And continues to.
James looks on, considering the choice, intrigued...

75.
POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
BANDER walks past rows and rows of BRIGSBY TAPES, browsing.
Stops in front one: “Volume Five, Episode One.”
On a small VCR/TV:
BRIGSBY (but cheaper, cruder) on a small, sparsely decorated
set. The words “It’s Brigsby!” hand-painted in big block
letters on the wall. Low-rent “Captain Kangaroo” vibe.
He confers with YOUNG ARIELLE and NINA SMILES, surrounded by
a magic force field.
BRIGSBY
Your magic powers get stronger by
the day, Sisters!
ARIELLE SMILES
Soon we’ll be strong enough to
banish Sun Snatcher to the shadow
galaxy forever!
BRIGSBY
That’s right! But first, we have to
make our physical bodies strong.
(turns to camera)
Ready, everyone?
Brigsby and the young Smiles sisters MARCH in place, then
launch into some coordinated calisthenics.
And one, and lunge, and two, and
two. Now crunch! And stop. And
remember that we’re all just
rapidly decaying organic material!
And hop!
On Bander, expression hardened, super weirded out.
OMIT
POPE DRIVEWAY - DAY
James stands holding a BASKETBALL, looking none too enthused.
Greg Pope, in gym shorts, instructs James on shooting form.
GREG POPE
Okay, now just keep your shoulders
square, elbow in -- good. Now bend
your knees, lift the ball into the
air, and follow through with your
hand.

76.
James gives it a try, but the ball falls well short of the
basketball hoop.
GREG POPE
Hey, alright! Good first try.
MINUTES LATER: Greg Pope uses a broomstick to lower the hoop.
GREG POPE
There we go... This’ll be a little
easier. Plus -- look, we can do
slam dunk on it!
Greg Pope goes up for a monster jam!
GREG POPE
Wooooo!
(lands awkwardly)
Ooh-- yikes, tweaked my ankle there
a bit... Darn it.
He limps to the ball, passes it James.
Here, wanna give it a shot?
James lets the ball bounce past him.
JAMES
Actually, I’m pretty busy with my
movie today...
GREG POPE
Well, maybe take a little break?
Seems like you've been working
pretty hard, and could be nice to
just hangout for a bit, you and me?
James starts to walk off.
No thanks.

JAMES

Greg Pope hesitates, frustrated. Then-GREG POPE
Am I doing something wrong here?
James turns around: huh?
GREG POPE
Look I don’t want to discourage you
from being creative, but the thing
is, this movie you’re making...
(MORE)

77.
GREG POPE (CONT'D)
it’s based on something that...
Really bad people created it... as
a way to hurt you, and keep you
away from us. And we don’t want
spending too much time thinking
about that sort of thing, okay?
You’re with the good guys now.
JAMES
But... Brigsby’s what makes me
happy. I’m not like you.
(gestures to hoop)
I don’t like slamming, okay?
James heads inside. Greg Pope stands there a moment,
frustrated. Stretches out his injured ankle.
AUBREY’S ROOM - DAY
Aubrey and Merideth, hanging. SPENCER, in the doorway,
holding the Brigsby head.
AUBREY
So, what are you guys doing?
SPENCER
Oh, you know, mess around with this
crazy bear thing. Hike around, go
to the beach, camp for the night.
James comes up behind him.
JAMES
We’re going to a real mountain. Do
you guys want to come?
AUBREY
Yeah, I don’t know...
SPENCER
I’m bringing party supplies...
Merideth gives a thumbs-up.
JAMES
Come on, it’s gonna be so much fun,
and also dope as shit.
Aubrey sorta-smiles, hesitant.

78.
MOUNTAINS - TRAIL - AFTERNOON
Green and golden, sparkling LAKE below them. Hiking up.
CLEARING - MINUTES LATER
Aubrey sits with Merideth, watching-James and Spencer set up a shot, yards away. James, wearing
the costume, excitedly explains how we wants it to look,
boundless energy and enthusiasm. Spencer’s into it, laughing,
making suggestions.
Aubrey can’t help herself -- the interaction makes her SMILE.
That look on James’ face -- happy, himself. Her brother.
James runs over, tries to get her involved. She LAUGHS.
MOUNTAINS - SUNSET
Vast, rolling ridges, GLOWING with magic hour light.
BRIGSBY, the size of an action figure, adventures atop.
LAKE - DUSK
Wash of waves, crackle of campfire.
Two tents. A few campsites and RVs in the distance.
Merideth poses for phone pics, wearing the Brigsby head,
holding a bottle of tequila, giving the middle finger.
Spencer frames it up, hesitates.
SPENCER
No Facebook or Instagram, please.
MERIDETH
It’s a snap; chill.
JAMES
Merideth, could I talk to you for a
second?
Merideth takes off the Brigsby head.
MERIDETH
Sure, what’s up?
James hesitates. Something weighing on him...
JAMES
Maybe we should go over here...

79.
MERIDETH
(confused)
Okay...
She hands the head off to Logan. James and Merideth walk.
JAMES
First of all, I think you’re so
great.
MERIDETH
Thanks man. I think you’re chill
too.
JAMES
And the other night was fun.
MERIDETH
Ha, yeah you were so wasted.
JAMES
Yeah... Listen, this is really hard
for me, cuz I know we really liked
feeling each other’s bodies and
doing sex type stuff, but-(beat)
I don’t think I can marry you.
MERIDETH
(laughs)
Yeah, for sure.
JAMES
So, you’re okay with that?
MERIDETH
Uh, yeah, of course. I’m never
getting married. My parents are so
messed up and sad.
JAMES
(relieved)
Really? That’s so great. Thank you.
James gives her a friendly hug.
(under breath)
So, no marriage. But do we still
want to do that stuff?
AUBREY
Hey, James--

80.
Over by the fire, Aubrey scrolls through songs on her iPhone.
AUBREY
Was it this song?
She plays a sparkly night jam. James walks over, listening.
JAMES
I don’t think so. But I like it.
AUBREY
Oh, maybe it’s... Hold on-Another song -- the same synth-y music that was coming from
her room the other night!
JAMES
Yeah! That’s it!
AUBREY
I’ve been listening to this
constantly; it’s amazing. I’ll send
you a playlist.
James doesn’t know what that means but is nevertheless
floored with gratitude.
JAMES
That would be so cool, to get one
of those.
Merideth takes off the Brigsby head, sits down with them.
Aubrey looks at James, thinking.
AUBREY
They probably didn’t even let you
listen to music, huh?
JAMES
No, they did, sometimes. Mostly
stuff by The Beatlers, cuz my old
dad was in that band.
MERIDETH
Did you just say “Beatlers?”
JAMES
Yeah, The Beatlers.
(off their confusion)
I have one of their tapes...
James roots through the contents of his duffle bag.
He pulls out a cassette, and puts it into the Brigsby head.

81.
He presses play, and the mouth moves along with the lyrics.
The music is incredibly strange.
AUBREY
Whoa. This... sucks. It’s like the
worst thing I’ve ever heard.
(listens more)
I kinda love it.
James smiles. A moment between them...
JAMES
Too bad you weren’t abducted. I bet
we would’ve had fun together.
Aubrey’s a bit confused by the sentiment, but moved
nonetheless.
AUBREY
Yeah, I guess... I always wondered
who you were. What it would be like
to meet you. I remember when I
first found out. I was 9, maybe.
Dad said, “You have a big brother.”
It made so much sense. I always
knew there was something... not
there, with them. So I was like,
the consolation prize, I guess.
(then)
Sorry I’ve been kind of...
whatever, to you.
JAMES
That’s okay... I’m glad you came.
AUBREY
Yeah, me too.
James surprises her with a HUG, which she begrudgingly
reciprocates. But the moment is crashed by-SPENCER
Awwwwwww.
AUBREY
(disengaging)
Oh God, whatever...

82.
SPENCER
(to James)
Last shot, man You ready to do
this?
James stops the tape, springs up, excited.
JAMES
Yeah! Let’s go!
EMPTY BEACH - NIGHT
Spencer’s truck pulls onto the sand. ROAD above the bank
ahead. Engine cuts, lights fade.
James unlatches the truck bed gate. Pulls the TARP off-A FUTURISTIC SPACE GENERATOR!
(Scrap metal, computer parts, LED lights.)
SPENCER
Holy shit, man... Look at all this
electronic shit.
JAMES
Yeah, that part’s the mainframe,
and that’s the quadrium processor.
SPENCER
Man, this is gonna look awesome.
They get in, lift it.
SPENCER’S TRUCK - EMPTY BEACH - MINUTES LATER
Spencer tapes the TRIPOD to the open bed gate, camera lens
pointed behind the truck. He turns on LIGHTS, angles it on
James, 50 yards away, half-burying the blinking GENERATOR in
the sand.
SPENCER
You ready to do this?
James gets the sand just right...
JAMES
Okay, ready!
James strikes a MATCH and lights a FUSE in the sand. Then he
puts on his Brigsby head, and kneels next to the generator.
Spencer hits RECORD, gets in the truck.
TRUCK CAM:

83.
Brigsby flips open a panel, punches in a code on the
mainframe. Then it shoots a tower of SPARKS!
Brigsby stands, starts running away from it...
And the generator EXPLODES into yellow and green flames!
Followed by a spray of professional-grade FIREWORKS!
Deep, loud, huge.
SPENCER’S TRUCK - THAT MOMENT
Spencer slams on the breaks, shocked. Jumps out of the car.
BEACH - CONTINUOUS
There’s a CAR ALARM going off somewhere. Generator SMOKING.
SPENCER
Dude, what is this shit!?
JAMES
(running up)
Did you get it?
SPENCER
The bomb that you just exploded?
Yeah, I got it. What the was that?!
JAMES
I worked on it, yesterday, so our
movie would have more-(clearly read this
somewhere)
--big budget appeal.
SPENCER
Someone definitely saw that. We
gotta go, now.
The generator starts to FLAME.
Holy shit!
He runs towards it. James follows, not nearly as worried.
JAMES
Did it look cool?
SPENCER
Dude -- I’ve been driving around a
truck filled with explosives all
day. That is not cool, at all.

84.
They scoop sand, struggle to put it out.
JAMES
I know you talked about using
animation, but I thought doing it
for real might be better. Plus,
practical effects are a dying art
form.
SPENCER
You can’t just blow shit up, man!
Why not?

JAMES

Spencer stands up, notices something-On the ROAD above: RED AND BLUE LIGHTS heading toward them.
SPENCER
God damnit...
COAST GUARD (LOUDSPEAKER)
Step away from the device, and put
your hands in the air!
JAMES
Oh, it’s just police. They’re nice.
The COAST GUARD TRUCK comes into the shore.
COAST GUARD (LOUDSPEAKER)
Hands up, now!
James puts his hands in the air, yells-JAMES
We’re okay! We don’t need any
police help! Sorry about the mess -we’re just gonna finish cleaning
up! Thank you! Bye!
James turns around and starts casually jogging away.
An OFFICER jumps to shore, chases James and TACKLES him into
the sand.
PARKED POLICE CAR - BACK SEAT
James, head tilted back, holding tissues in a bloody nose.
Spencer, sick to his stomach, freaked out. Silent...
James looks over, nervous, offers--

85.
JAMES
I bet I can explain it to Detective
Vogel...?
SPENCER
Doesn’t matter... I’m on probation.
JAMES
What does “on probation” mean?
SPENCER
It means my life is over.
A charged silence between them. James finally breaks it-JAMES
I think the next scene where we
need explosions, we should do your
idea, with the animation.
Spencer just shakes his head.
CEDAR HILLS POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM
James, alone again. A different sort of anxiety hanging.
Door opens... and OFFICER BANDER comes in. Deadly serious.
He throws a folder on the table. Stands there a moment, lets
his presence do the intimidating. Then-BANDER
Malibu PD says they found marijuana
and an open container of alcohol in
the truck. Not to mention the
improvised explosive device, the
detonation of which is technically
an act of domestic terrorism. You
have anything to say for yourself?
James really thinks about it. Doesn’t want to mess this up.
JAMES
Everything that happened, it was my
fault. All the marijuana smokings,
the bad drinks. Those were mine.
The explosion stuff too. No one
else should get in trouble.
BANDER
Where’d you get the bomb-making
materials?

86.
JAMES
Just, the internet. And the store.
BANDER
And the costume?
James hesitates...
JAMES
I stole it.
BANDER
You stole it?
JAMES
Detective Vogel told me where they
had all the stuff, so I snuck in
when no one was looking, but it
wasn’t his fault, okay? He didn’t
do anything wrong.
(then)
I’m sorry to you. And I’m sorry to
America.
Bander sits. Looks at him.
BANDER
I watched the tapes.
JAMES
What tapes?
BANDER
“Brigsby Bear.” Several episodes.
JAMES
Which ones?
BANDER
The first couple volumes.
JAMES
(?)
Oh, those ones are just for kids...
(thinks about it)
I mean, they were for me, I guess,
when I was a kid.
BANDER
Well, I think I got the gist of it.
Dark. Filled with messages.
Bander takes a long, probing look at him.

87.

They really did a number on you,
didn’t they?
OFF JAMES, uncertainty weighing...
MATCH CUT TO:
THE BRIGSBY HEAD - EVIDENCE LOCKER
Sideways on a shelf. Obscured as a metal gate SLAMS SHUT.
OMIT
POPE HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Greg and Louise Pope, Aubrey, James and Emily sit around the
coffee table. Greg looks stern, Louise on the verge of tears.
Aubrey and James just eye the floor.
Emily leads the discussion with a comfortable, everything’sfine confidence.
EMILY
James. Your family is all here
today because they care about you
very, very much. But they’re also
concerned.
(a beat)
You haven’t been communicating with
them, James. To put it lightly.
Next thing you know, you’re falling
in with the absolute wrong kind of
people, and-AUBREY
You mean me and my friends?
GREG POPE
Aubrey, you know what she means.
EMILY
The point is, we’re looking at some
serious criminal charges here.
James chews on that, incredulous.
JAMES
I was just making Brigsby...
EMILY
James, we’re not here to talk about
Brigsby. This is about you.

88.
James feels out the room. Not sure about the look on
everyone’s face. Especially Louise, barely holding back
tears. Greg looks at him, calm, concerned.
GREG POPE
We love you, James. And we want you
to be happy.
EMILY
That’s right. And we want you to
recognize the chance you have -right now -- to embrace a new
start.
JAMES
So... what does that mean?
EMILY
It means finally putting Brigsby
aside, and moving on with the rest
of your life.
James can barely comprehend this, indignant.
JAMES
So... what? Just forget about him?
Emily sighs with profound concern.
LOUISE POPE
James, I know that sounds hard, but
the world is so much bigger than
you know. And it’s filled with so
many amazing, wonderful things.
GREG POPE
That’s right -- remember Gordo from
Hockey High?
JAMES
I don’t care about that stuff. I
already know Brigsby’s the greatest
hero. And when everything’s against
him, he never gives up, even if
it’s hopeless.
James pauses, emotion surfacing.
He’s my whole life.
Greg Pope takes a hard look at him, frustration boiling over.

89.
GREG POPE
Your whole life? Your whole life
we’ve been out there, looking for
you, James. For 25 years, I
couldn’t sleep. Because every night
I would close my eyes, and there
you were, in my arms, smiling.
A silent beat as Greg collects himself.
These... monsters, they stole you
away from us. They destroyed us. Do
you understand that? And now that
we have you back, all you want to
do is stay in their world. It
hurts, James. It isn’t right.
James absorbs all that. Finally musters:
JAMES
You don’t know anything about
Brigsby. At all. And you never
will. So... fuck you.
(then)
I know what it means.
An emotional silence hangs over the group.
GOOGLE SEARCH BAR: “BRIGSBY SMILES SISTERS REAL LIFE”
James scans the flood of results. Eventually finds:
“Arizona Woman performed in Pope kidnapper’s bizarre videos.”
POPE HOUSEHOLD - MIDNIGHT
James straightens up, checks himself in the mirror.
Lights off. Dead quiet. James sneaks down the stairs...
Swipes a CAR KEY from the counter.
DRIVEWAY - MINUTES LATER
James REVERSES down the driveway in Greg Pope’s Lexus.
K-turns into someone’s BRICK MAILBOX, demolishes it.
He peels off, swerves through the yard, and disappears down
the street.
MUSIC: Spirit Journey to the Quantnix Zone, Brigsby Vol. 19.
OMIT

90.
LEXUS - DESERT - MORNING
The Lexus slows to stop. James stares ahead at-HIS OLD HOUSE - DAY
Perimeter of POLICE TAPE but otherwise as he left it.
James gets out of the car, takes a look around...
He goes the OASIS. Takes GRAZERBUG in his hand, looks at it
for what it is -- a light bulb, goofy face, antenna.
And the GUNNERFOX -- open back, clear animatronic features.
He wipes dust off the PIER, sees the empty BENCH inside.
ROADSIDE DINER - PARKING LOT - DAY
The Lexus, parked outside with a couple trucks.
Inside, James counts change from the console.
ROADSIDE DINER - BOOTH - MINUTES LATER
James, holding a menu, looks around-He sees a handful of other patrons and a line cook.
As he looks over the menu, a WAITRESS steps over.
WAITRESS (O.S.)
Can I get you something to drink?
James looks up with the intention of answering, but is
suddenly unable. Standing in front of him is ARIELLE SMILES.
ARIELLE SMILES
Sir?
James snaps out of it, but doesn’t know where to start.
JAMES
Uh, yeah, just -- I only have this
many credits.
He puts a handful of COINS on the table.
ARIELLE SMILES
(counting)
Okay... That’ll get you a fountain
drink, or a coffee? Piece of fruit,
maybe?
James looks up at her, staring, not able to shake his awe.

91.

Hello?
JAMES
Sorry, it’s just...
(joking)
I never would of guessed I’d find
you so far outside the gates of
Glenrona.
(then)
But I did actually have to go to a
lot of diners out here.
She looks caught off guard. Notices his BRIGSBY T-SHIRT.
ARIELLE SMILES
(realizing)
You’re the... James, right?
(off him)
Um... My shift’s almost up; give me
a couple minutes, okay?
James watches her walk away. Blinks to make sure she’s real.
ARIELLE SMILES (PRELAP)
I guess I found out when you did,
basically...
125

BOOTH - MINUTES LATER
James and Arielle Smiles sit across from each other.
Sandwiches and fountain sodas before them.
ARIELLE SMILES
It was a little extra money every
month... He told me it was for
Canadian public access. I would
just show up, and he would give my
lines. I didn’t really ask a lot of
questions, obviously. I mean, it
was fun, but...
James listens, rapt, quiet reverence unbroken.
I’ve been sick to my stomach. I
wish I had never, uh... I don’t
know what to say. I’m just so, so
sorry, for everything.
James makes a face, confused.

125

92.
JAMES
“Sorry?” But... you and Brigsby -and Nina too, I guess -- you were
the only thing that made the world
okay. You were all I had.
(realizes, emotional)
And I guess you still are.
Arielle Smiles looks taken aback.
ARIELLE SMILES
You realize I’m not actually her,
right? My name’s Whitney.
JAMES
No, I know, now, but-ARIELLE SMILES
Nina too -- he just flipped the
image, or something.
JAMES
Yeah, it’s a cool effect, but...
you made it real. And the way you
were there for Brigsby, even when
it seemed impossible? He never
could have done it by himself.
A beat as Arielle Smiles looks James over.
ARIELLE SMILES
How did you find me?
JAMES
(shrugs)
The same way Brigsby did, I
guess... Destiny.
James timidly reaches across the table and puts his hand on
top of hers. She seems a little uncomfortable, but lets it
stand. Then her phone BUZZES and she takes her hand away.
ARIELLE SMILES
I’m sorry, I have to pick up my kid
in a few minutes.
JAMES
Oh. Okay...
ARIELLE SMILES
I’m glad I met you though, I guess.
You seem really... sweet.

93.
James cracks a smile, touched. A big moment for him. But-JAMES
Wait, before you go, I’ve always
wanted to ask... In Volume 19, did
you really not know about the
Quantix the whole time? Or were you
just trying to protect the Wizzles?
ARIELLE SMILES
Uh... I don’t really remember that.
JAMES
Oh. Yeah.
(then)
So, you would never want to do it
again, then? To help me finish it?
She hesitates...
ARIELLE SMILES
I mean, I don’t really know if...
But her eyes are drawn outside. James turns to look too-POLICE CRUISERS pull into the parking lot, lights on.
James turns back to Arielle Smiles, dejected.
JAMES
That’s okay. I guess it’s time for
me to go, anyway.
ARIELLE SMILES
Those are for you?
He nods, solemn.
JAMES
I’ve been an outlaw ever since I
came to this world.
(then)
It’s dope as shit.
James stands, reaches into his pocket...
And he pulls out the SORTIS CRYSTAL. Places it on the table.
You’re the only one who can keep
this safe.
(then)
Thanks for the sandwich and coke.

94.
James walks for the door.
Halfway there, he stops, turns back around.
JAMES
Also, I’m in love with you, and I
always have been.
He continues to the door, opens it.
Puts his hands up, faces his fate.
Please no tackles!
Arielle Smiles watches him, overwhelmed.
Off the Sortis Crystal, gleaming in the sunlight.
POPE HOUSEHOLD - TOP OF THE STAIRS - NIGHT
James timidly steps out of his room...
Murmur of Greg and Louise Pope ARGUING comes into focus:
GREG POPE (O.S.)
What choice do we have?
KITCHEN - POPE HOUSEHOLD
Greg and Louise Pope stand on either side of the island.
Exhausted, emotional.
GREG POPE
We know what Dr. Larson
recommending to the judge.
LOUISE POPE
But we can appeal, right? Or
something? He’s not dangerous, he
just... He needs us. To make more
of an effort, to be with him.
GREG POPE
I’m making an effort!
LOUISE POPE
You pushed him away. You don’t
listen, you don’t care about what
anyone else wants. This is what you
do!
GREG POPE
He’s not well. You didn’t see what
I saw. I watched him have a full
break with reality.

95.
LOUISE POPE
So we just kick him out?
GREG POPE
What happens if we just let him go
on like this? He’s not-- He’s 25.
He can’t just live in is own world
forever. Don’t you want him to have
a real life?
LOUISE POPE
Of course I do...
GREG POPE
What if he ends up like them -alone, shut off from the world?
What if he kidnaps someone and
forces them to watch his Bear
movie?
LOUISE POPE
Greg. That’s ridiculous.
GREG POPE
Is it? He’s not well, Louise. And
they’re still in control!
(then)
I want my son back...
Louise covers her face, quietly sobs.
Regret flashes over Greg Pope. He wraps her in a hug.
GREG POPE
I’m sorry. We knew this wasn’t
going to be easy. We knew that...
TOP OF THE STAIRS - SAME
James, despondent, lets their words sink in...
MUSIC: Imprisoned in the Mirror Chamber, Brigsby Vol. 24.
The somber music carries us through-EMPTY GYM - DAY
SPENCER sits with other rehabbing youths, fold-out chairs
encircled for discussion. But SPENCER’S not listening...
He sneaks out his phone, checks it-A row of unanswered texts to Aubrey.
“Hey...” “I’m sorry...” “You around?” “Can we talk?”

96.
WATKINS GLEN MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - DAY
A white DOOR opens to reveal-A sterile, semi-private room. Shared bathroom in the back.
James stands in the doorway. Wearing nice, new, stupid
clothes. Holding a small bag of personal supplies.
SPENCER’S ROOM - DAY
Spencer scrolls Twitter on his computer, bored.
He opens a video-editing application. Presses play on a
BRIGSBY CLIP (adventuring in the mountains).
It looks pretty good. He smiles...
MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - DAY - EXPRESSION ABSENT
-James sits slumped in a chair at GROUP TIME.
-James meanders around the therapeutic courtyard garden.
-James by himself at a cafeteria table. A friendly patient,
ERIC, takes a seat across from him, holding two soft-serve
cones. He offers one to James.
-James does lessons with DR. MORROW in the COMPUTER LAB,
graphing another physics equation. Dr. Morrow takes notes.
DR. MORROW (PRELAP)
Well, I’m impressed. But I’m also
very confused...
MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - ACTIVITIES ROOM - DAY
James sits at an art table, drawing with crayons.
Across the room, Emily and Dr. Morrow confer.
DR. MORROW
He’s extremely sharp. We started
with algebra, and quite quickly
made our way to quantum field
theory. Then, it got... well,
strange. Very theoretical, hard to
follow. He showed me an equation
they were working on. Said it was
part of a larger theory that
would... Allow them to travel
between parallel dimensions.
(MORE)

97.
DR. MORROW (CONT'D)
(then)
Nonsense, essentially.
Emily considers that, confused. Turns to look at James.
James continues to color with little energy, uninspired.
Eric comes over, excited-ERIC
What are you working on?
James shows him his drawing: a simple RECTANGLE. That’s it.
ERIC
Whoa! Let me try.
Eric sits down with him.
EMILY (PRELAP)
James, I just want to start by
saying how extremely proud I am.
MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - MEETING LOUNGE - MORNING
James sits at a table with Emily, despondent.
But Emily smiles encouragingly.
EMILY
Really. I mean it. I know it hasn’t
been the easiest road getting here,
but you’re showing real progress.
Soon, we can get you back on track
with your education, and start
strengthening other aspects of your
life. Doesn’t that sound great?
This appraisal doesn’t seem to lift James’ spirits.
(pressing on)
Well, in the spirit of putting
things behind us, there was one
thing I thought you should know...
Your kidnappers have pleaded
guilty. That means they’re going
away, for a long time. And it’s
okay to have conflicting emotions
about that...
James considers that with an unexpected wash of emotion...
Emily holds him by the shoulders, finds his eyes.
You made it, James. You’re okay.

98.
She brings him close, hugs him.
JAMES’ NEW ROOM - LATE NIGHT
Silent. James lays awake in bed, unable to sleep.
Then, the sound of soft STATIC fades in...
Confused, James turns to the-RADIO, which begins emitting a pulsing, ethereal GLOW.
James sits up in bed, freaked out.
BRIGSBY (RADIO)
(coming in and out)
James... Are you there, James...?
James stands, goes to the radio.
Brigsby...?
He fiddles with the dial, finding the frequency.
BRIGSBY (RADIO)
(clearer)
James, is that you? I’ve been
trying to reach you! I’m trapped in
negative subspace -- I had to hack
your dimension’s earth’s A-M
frequency! I need you, James. Now
more than ever before...
James really thinks about that, and his eyes well with tears.
JAMES
No. I can’t.
A beat of empty static before-BRIGSBY
(heartbroken)
James? But... It’s our most
desperate hour. The universe hangs
on the edge of existence.
He can barely bring himself to do it but-JAMES
Don’t you get it? It’s too late!
Everyone’s mad at me because of
you.
(then)
I can’t be with you any more.
James CLICKS OFF the radio. He sits on his bed, unsteady.
Catches his breath, wipes his eyes.

99.
AUBREY’S ROOM - NIGHT
Aubrey does homework, uninvested. Interrupted by the DING of
a cell phone notification. She checks her phone.
It’s another in a long line of unanswered Spencer texts:
“check yr email (bear emoji)”
Aubrey looks cautiously intrigued...
HD TV - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A reel of beautifully photographed BRIGSBY SCENES, edited
together with music and early effects work.
REVERSE ON:
Aubrey, Greg and Louise Pope, watching from the couch.
Aubrey points things out to Louise Pope, who smiles,
impressed and proud. Greg Pope is more guarded, but...
ON SCREEN:
James, in costume, runs down a sunset-lit green hill toward
Aubrey. He takes off the Brigsby head, sweaty, laughing.
JAMES (ON SCREEN)
Did we get it!? This is gonna be
better than all the other Brigsby
episodes, ever!
REVERSE ON:
Greg, eyes glued to the screen, a realization dawning.
PRE-LAP: KNOCK-KNOCK
CEDAR HILLS POLICE STATION - VOGEL’S OFFICE - DAY
Vogel looks up from his desk to see...
VOGEL
Mr. Pope...
Greg Pope stands in the doorway, heart heavy, conciliatory.
GREG POPE
Detective... I was hoping we could
talk?
VOGEL
(worried)
You mean, about Feldo Mortese?
GREG POPE
What’s Feldo Mortese?

100.
VOGEL
Oh, nothing, never mind. What can I
help you with?
MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - KITCHEN - NIGHT
James sneaks in under cover of darkness, searches cabinets.
JAMES ROOM - MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - NIGHT
James pulls the sheet off his bed, fashions it into a SACK.
He adds: A bar of soap, plastic utensils, a pair of clean
socks and underwear. Ties it off.
There’s a KNOCK, and James looks up to see Eric come into the
room, heart heavy, holding a paper grocery bag.
ERIC
I’m just wanted to say good luck on
your adventure, and I’m gonna miss
having you around.
Eric hands him the bag. James looks inside, pulls out some
arts-and-crafts cardboard cut outs.
Throwing stars, knives, laser guns - basically all my weapons I’ve
been saving up.
JAMES
Thanks Eric. I didn’t know if I’d
ever have a real friend again.
They hug. Then-ERIC
So, how are you gonna break out of
here?
JAMES
It’s complicated. I’ve been
planning it for a long time.
CUT TO:
A TV CRASHES THROUGH A FIRST-FLOOR WINDOW! - NIGHT
Lands in the street next to the mental health facility.
James clears the glass and wire around the edges with a
broken SHOWER HANDLE. He tosses his supplies, hops out.

101.
Then he runs into the night.
OMIT
BUSHES - NIGHT
Brushed out of the way to reveal-The POPE’S BACKYARD. Dark, quiet...
POPE HOUSEHOLD - BACK PATIO - MOMENTS LATER
James sneaks around the side of the house, then quietly to
the door. Tries the handle... OPENS it slowly.
POPE HOUSEHOLD - STAIRS
Dark throughout. James climbs to the 2nd floor hallway.
Enters-JAMES’ ROOM
To find it back to its original state, stripped of all
Brigsby-ness. James stands there a moment...
Then he sees his DUFFLE BAG in the corner. He opens it, makes
sure his BRIGSBY SHIRT is inside. He folds it carefully,
places it back inside, and zips the bag up.
POPE HOUSEHOLD - MOMENTS LATER
James sneaks back down the stairs, duffle bag in hand. He
starts to exit, but stops himself, noticing-LIGHT coming from a cracked door... He moves closer, curious.
Hears the muffled sound of VOICES and MOVEMENT.
He leans to the crack, sliver of light painting his face.
What he sees makes his JAW DROP...
James pulls the door all the way OPEN, revealing-BRIGSBY BEAR’S CABIN!
(Well, actually the GARAGE, transformed by the presence of
the Brigsby Bear set. But still!)
James steps inside, taking it in with religious wonder.
Every consciousness-seared detail made real before him.
MUSIC: The peak of Forever Mountain, Brigsby Vol. 16.

102.
He drops to his knees, overwhelmed.
AUBREY (O.S.)
James?
James turns to the DRIVEWAY, where he sees-GREG and LOUISE POPE, AUBREY, SPENCER and VOGEL, unloading
the back of a MOVING TRUCK. Surrounded by Brigsby props,
costumes, pieces of sets, lights, and an old TV CAMERA.
James looks between them, tears in his eyes, at a total loss.
They look surprised to see him, but glad. James stands.
JAMES
What is...? I mean... How did this
happen?
LOUISE POPE
Well, it was supposed to be a
surprise, for when you got home...
JAMES
But they told me... They said they
were gonna get rid of everything?
Spencer hops down from the truck.
SPENCER
Yeah, Feldo gave us a heads-up.
Vogel smiles at James.
VOGEL
I wanted to say thanks. And I
figured, better this stuff with you
than in a dumpster somewhere.
AUBREY
It was Dad’s idea to do the garage,
though.
James turns to Greg Pope, hardly believing any of this.
JAMES
Really?
GREG POPE
Yeah, well...
He hesitates, voice wobbling with emotion and contrition.

103.

Aubrey showed us some of the stuff
you had done together, and... yeah.
I guess, I thought it looked pretty
cool, son. And then I thought about
the list, so... Might be a fun
thing to do with the whole family,
right?
James wraps his head around the very concept.
JAMES
But... they told me not to even
think about Brigsby any more, or I
would never get to leave?
GREG POPE
Right, well... It sounds to us like
Dr. Larson’s being a little too
hard on you.
JAMES
Yeah.
LOUISE POPE
And you’ve been doing so well with
everything else -- in a couple
weeks they’re letting us have an
independent evaluation, then,
hopefully, you get to come on home.
JAMES
And finish Brigsby...
GREG POPE
We’re your family, James. We love
you for who you are. And we know
Brigsby’s a part of that.
James lets that wash over him, emotion surging...
He steps over to his family, tearing up.
HUGS his mom. His dad and his sister join in the embrace.
Spencer hangs back. Thinks about something...
SPENCER
Dude, wait, how did you get here?
JAMES
(through tears/the hug)
I threw a TV through the window.

104.
That throws off the hug a bit. His parents GRUMBLE (ad-lib).
I know, sorry...
The hug loosens, turns into a close grouping.
LOUISE POPE
Well, we have to tell somebody...?
Greg Pope thinks about it.
GREG POPE
They don’t know you’re gone yet,
right?
James shrugs. So Greg shrugs too.
Well, I’m sure we’ll get a call.
(then)
You want to help unload everything?
James smiles. Uh, yeah. He does.
MUSIC UP -- James laughs with his family, explaining various
props and miniatures, inspecting everything, trying the
LIGHTS out, high-fiving Spencer, handing out Pop-Tarts...
FADE OUT...
CROSSLAKE MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY
Greg Pope’s LEXUS pulls up outside, idles.
“Six Months Later”
GREG POPE’S LEXUS - CONTINUOUS
In the passenger seat, James looks out the window,
apprehensive.
GREG POPE
You okay, kiddo?
James takes a deep breath.
JAMES
I think so.
Greg gives him a loving pat on the shoulder.
GREG POPE
I’ll be here if you need anything.

105.
CROSSLAKE MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - YARD - DAY
Picnic style tables strewn about a patchy lawn.
A GUARD escorts a prisoner into the yard... TED BURRELL.
He searches, finds us.
JAMES waves to him, timid.
TED BURRELL (PRELAP)
Well bud, would you look at that...
TIME CUT: James and Ted sit at a far table.
Ted looks James over, amazed, a war of emotions.
TED BURRELL
You’re all grown up and out in the
world and... just, wow. I didn’t
know if I’d ever get to see you
again...
James sorta smiles, not quite comfortable.
So... How are you, bud?
JAMES
I’m... good. With my original
family, and I’m going to a math
school, which is easy, so far.
TED BURRELL
That’s fantastic! Your-- uh, April
would be so happy to hear that.
Have you been to see her yet?
James shakes his head no. Ted gets it, but-Well, we write each other. And I
know she’d love it. She finally
solved the Vansmithe, you know.
JAMES
Really? What was it?
TED BURRELL
Six! The whole time.
JAMES
(skeptical)
Ooohhhhh.
I actually, uh -- the reason I came
here. I had a question...

106.
Ted nods like he understands.
TED BURRELL
Well, I don’t know how much of it I
can really explain, but... I still
think about the day she came home,
with you in her arms... And, you
know, it wasn’t my idea, exactly,
but... There you were.
(beat)
I guess I was scared, bud. And I
knew it was wrong, but... some part
of me felt like, you were our boy.
And we wanted to give you
everything we had to give.
James looks away from him, unexpected emotion surfacing. He
organizes his stack of papers, covering.
JAMES
That’s, uh... That’s not really why
I’m here, though.
TED BURRELL
What’s all that?
JAMES
Brigsby Bear Adventures. The movie.
TED BURRELL
Really? You wrote it?
JAMES
Yeah, I finished it. The whole
story. I did it with my family, and
some friends. And we got a bunch of
free money from the internet.
TED BURRELL
James, that’s... amazing!
James shrugs modestly.
JAMES
Well, there’s still one thing we
can’t get right...
TED BURRELL
What’s that?
JAMES
The voices.

107.
Ted hesitates...
TED BURRELL
I, uh... I thought it was best to
just put all that behind me. I’m
actually working on something new.
JAMES
Really? What?
TED BURRELL
(sheepish)
It’s just a novel right now, but...
Knights of the Spectrum: 12th
Dimension Masters.
JAMES
Whoa, cool. What’s the story? Wait,
no -- we don’t have time.
James reaches into his pocket, pulls out a TAPE RECORDER.
Ted considers it...
(pleading)
The premiere’s next week...
TED BURRELL
Well, I am interested to see the
direction you went with it...
Ted picks up the top page, looks it over. A grin creeping up.
James hits RECORD. Ted clears his throat...
TED BURRELL
Ready?
James nods, and Ted gives him a smile...
Then he launches into a fully-inhabited performance:
(Brigsby voice)
It was a time of reckoning for the
galaxy I called home. And a time of
great magic...
Off James, surprised and oddly delighted.
The BRIGSBY SCORE begins to rise, carrying us to-MOVIE THEATRE MARQUEE - NIGHT
BRIGSBY BEAR ADVENTURES: THE MOVIE

108.
WORLD PREMIERE
SOLD OUT!
MOVIE THEATER
A packed audience, hushed, attentions rapt.
ON SCREEN
Brigsby looks out over a sunlit desert valley.
His mouth moves in sync with the dialogue. Sort of.
BRIGSBY (V.O.)
...few were able to stand against
the darkness...
On the horizon, the SUN SETS at a sped-up pace.
There’s an intense RAINBOW SUNSET, beautifully rendered.
Then STARS in the night sky.
Brigsby’s eyelids lower. He sees LIGHTS dot the horizon.
In a line, moving. Getting bigger. Flashing RED and BLUE.
As for me, I didn’t have a
choice...
The BRIGSBY THEME kicks into full gear, takes us into-“BRIGSBY BEAR ADVENTURES” - OPENING CREDITS
Yes, the same sequence as the original show, but with several
NEW SHOTS of James’ making.
AUDIENCE - THAT MOMENT
Spencer and Aubrey sit together, dressed up, enjoying it.
Then Spencer notices across the aisle -- an EMPTY SEAT.
BATHROOM - MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
Spencer walks in to find-- JAMES, in his Brigsby shirt,
standing over a toilet, dry heaving.
SPENCER
Whoa, hey, man -- you okay?
JAMES
What if... they don’t like it?

109.
SPENCER
Dude, everyone here is psyched.
They’re gonna love it.
JAMES
I’m just gonna stay here for a
bit...
LATER: James lying on his back, alone, stressed.
Muffled BRIGSBY SFX and MUSIC coming from the theater...
ON SCREEN - THE FINAL SCENE!
A celebration in the FUTURE LIGHT FORTRESS CEREMONIAL
CHAMBER. The production quality similar to the Brigsby TV
show, but with a cinematic flair that is all James’ own.
An animated CROWD (GOODY GOOSE among them) cheers and wave
banners. TRUMPETS blare.
Brigsby kneels in front of an ALIEN KING (ERIC from the
hospital, in makeup), who places a MEDAL around his neck.
FELDO MORTESE, also wearing a medal, looks on, proud.
ALIEN KING ERIC
We name you, Brigsby Bear... Hero
of Eternity!
ARIELLE AND NINA SMILES (yes, the Arielle and Nina Smiles),
wave their hands, casting SPARKLES over the celebration!
Brigsby stands, shakes hands with a DAD SUN SOLDER.
BRIGSBY
When I came to this world, I
thought you were my enemy. But we
came together to defeat Sun
Snatcher. And now, we’re family.
The Sun Soldier nods, embraces a MOM/DAUGHTER SUN SOLDIER.
AUDIENCE
Greg Pope smiling, Louise teary with pride, holding hands.
ON SCREEN
Brigsby addresses the crowd.
BRIGSBY
Worlds must now be rebuilt. It will
take time, but together we can...

110.
But he trails off as DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER rises from above...
And the chamber begins to SHAKE and FALL APART!
ARIELLE SMILES
Sun Snatcher? It’s impossible...
NINA SMILES
He must have infiltrated our
dimension when we folded space!
The roof RIPS OFF the palace!
SUN SNATCHER hangs overhead, obscured by wisps of cloud.
SUN SNATCHER
I have you now, bear!
AUDIENCE
BANDER makes a wholly invested “whoa!” face, which he turns
to share with VOGEL, who smiles and nods knowingly.
ON SCREEN
Brigsby confers with Feldo and the Sisters as debris rains.
ARIELLE SMILES
The Sun Snatcher simply can’t be
defeated, Brigsby!
FELDO MORTESE
Perhaps not. But now, a choice.
Perish here together, and let
Snatcher enslave all worlds? Or
fold every molecule of this
dimension into a singularity,
creating a whole new universe,
where the forces of light can fight
on...
BRIGSBY
A new beginning...?
AUDIENCE
EMILY, arms crossed, skeptical, wondering what in God’s name
she’s subjecting herself to.
ON SCREEN
Brigsby wields the SORTIS CRYSTAL, latches it onto Arielle’s
AMULET. An ENERGY FIELD surrounds them. Brigsby looks deep
into Arielle’s eyes...

111.
BRIGSBY
One more thing...
Holy shit -- Brigsby KISSES Arielle Smiles!
Animatronic mouth opening and closing. It’s... romantic.
BRIGSBY
Goodbye Arielle.
(afterthought)
You too, Nina.
Nina, off to the side, waves casually.
AUDIENCE
AUBREY puts her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.
Next to her: LOGAN and MERIDETH, stoned, enraptured.
ON SCREEN
Brigsby looks up, energy field glowing, amulet in hand.
The score CRESCENDOS... and he FLIES into the sky on a bright
white beam of energy!
Brigsby exits the atmosphere and COLLIDES with Sun Snatcher,
trapping him in an energy field, which rockets through space!
SUN SNATCHER
Noooooooooooo!
Faster and faster! Light speed! Into the biggest star in the
universe! It explodes in a SUPERNOVA, becomes a BLACK HOLE
and begins swallowing all existence! Entire galaxies crumble
and swirl into dust until... NOTHING. Soundless darkness.
But then-- LIGHT! A BIG BANG births a new universe!
“A FILM BY JAMES POPE AND HIS BEST FRIENDS AND FAMILY”
LOBBY - THAT MOMENT
James sits, clutching his knees, listening...
And then... APPLAUSE? Getting louder...
THEATER - SECONDS LATER
James walks in to find a STANDING OVATION, the crowd facing
the screen, whistling, shouting, cheering.
Standing in front of the screen is BRIGSBY BEAR himself.
Brigsby NODS to James. James nods back.
Brigsby steps inside the screen and gives James a final wave.

112.
Off James waving goodbye, we-VHS STATIC
