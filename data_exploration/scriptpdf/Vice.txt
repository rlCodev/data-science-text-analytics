INT. HAIR SALON - SAME TIME
A TV in a hair salon shows the 9/11 coverage. LYNNE CHENEY,

INT. UNDERGROUND WHITE HOUSE BUNKER - 9/11 9:38AM
Cheney begins barking out orders.

Let’s contact the FAA. Find out how
many planes are in the air.
JUMP CUT: Cheney, on the phone amidst the chaos, NORMAN
MINETA, DAVID ADDINGTON, Condi Rice, SCOOTER LIBBY, KAREN
HUGHES and a few others are there.
CONDI RICE
(into phone)
May I get the President on the
line, please?
STAFFER
That’s right. We’ve got planes in
the air and no where for them to
land.
The Twin Towers burn on the television as Dick lowers his
head into his hands.
CONDI RICE
Mr. Vice President, POTUS on line
1.
Council looks at Cheney as he is about to pick up a call from
POTUS.

3.
DICK
Mr. President, this situation is
extremely fluid. I am strongly
recommending you stay in the air.
I’ve sequestered Congressional
leadership and I’m coordinating our
response with the White House
team... Okay then...
Dick hangs up and we reveal Lynne, now standing behind him.
She has her hand on Dick’s shoulder. He touches her hand.
STAFFER
Sir, Don Rumsfeld on 3.
Cheney points to the speaker phone.
That?

CHENEY

He picks up the line.
RUMSFELD (V.O.)
Dick, there are still passenger

engagement.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
(male, late 20’s)
By all accounts of what people saw
in that room on that terrible day,
there was confusion, fear,
uncertainty, but Dick Cheney saw
something else that no one else
did... he saw an opportunity.
Famous Photo of Men Playing Golf while the hillside behind
them is on fire.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
As the world becomes more and more
confusing, we tend to focus on the
things that are right there in
front of us. While ignoring the
massive forces that actually change
and shape our lives.
VT and Stills of people working at Amazon and Wal-Mart.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And with people working longer and
longer hours, for less and less
wages, when we do have free time,
the last thing we want is
complicated analysis of our
government, lobbying, international
trade agreements.
VT of people partying and dancing.
Cheney clasps his hands thinking in the 9/11 Bunker.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
So it's no surprise that when a
monotone bureaucratic Vice
President came to power. We hardly
noticed. As he achieved a position
of authority that very few leaders
in the history of our nation ever
have.
Quick shots of the Iraq war, torture, the Senate passing tax
cuts etc.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Forever changing the course of
history for millions and millions
of lives. And he did it like a
ghost. With most people having no
idea who he is or where he came
from.

Lynne puts her hand on Dick’s shoulder as we SMASH CUT to Jet
Planes bombing a Middle Eastern Town with a ferocity.

How does a man go on to become who
he is? Well it starts in 1963.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - HOMECOMING
YOUNG LYNNE CHENEY, in the back of a fancy car: Miss Mustang,

She’s a cross between a movie star and a goddess.
NARRATOR
When Dick's best girl Lynne was
getting straight A's at Colorado
College,
INT. YALE DORM ROOM - DAY
Young Cheney passed out in bed. His sheets and floor covered
in vomit.
NARRATOR
Lynne had helped Dick get a
scholarship at Yale, where he did
way more drinking than class
attending. Pretty soon Dick got the
boot. So he went back home to
Wyoming to work as a lineman for
the state.
EXT. VAST WYOMING FIELD - DAY - 1963
Dick strapped to a pole works on power lines with a cigarette
in his mouth. It’s rough hard work.
NARRATOR
Back then they would have been
called a guy like him a ne’er-dowell. In today’s parlance they
would just call him a dirt bag.

6.
In the distance, a Man SCREAMS. Dick looks down below.
Man down!

LINEMAN #1

EXT. POWER LINE BASE - CONTINUOUS
Linemen gather around a FALLEN MAN who’s leg has snapped in
half, a bone sticking out of his torn pants.
LINEMAN #2
His leg looks like an Elvis dance
move.
The men laugh.
LINEMAN #1
Somebody give that poor son of a
bitch a shot of whiskey.
LINEMAN BOSS
Alright, back to work. I SAID, Back
to work!
Everyone walks away except Cheney who continues to stare at
the writhing man.
LINEMAN BOSS (CONT’D)
(to Lineman #3)
Take him into town, put $5 in his
pocket. Find another man for
tomorrow.
(to Cheney)
You got a problem Cheney?
No sir.

DICK

Cheney takes a drag of his smoke and walks away.
INT. ROAD SIDE BAR WYOMING 1963 - NIGHT
Dick dances around the bar drunk with a giant smile on his
face, taking shots and stumbling into other locals.
A SHIFTY CREW MEMBER keeps putting his arm around Dick’s
shoulder. He’s trying to agitate Cheney.
SHIFTY CREW MEMBER
Are we becoming friends?

7.
DICK
Will you stop touching me?
SHIFTY CREW MEMBER
What you gonna do about it, Mr.
Yale? Huh?
Cheney slaps Crew Member’s hand off his shoulder.
SHIFTY CREW MEMBER (CONT’D)
Woah! The fuck you gonna do about
it, Mr. Yale? Come on!
Dick shoves him back and PUNCHES HIM.
EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - NIGHT
From earlier, with the police officer’s help, Cheney stumbles
out of the car. The crackle of the police radio in the
background.
EXT. LYNNE’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING
A lower middle class home. A dog barks in the distance.
INT. LYNNE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
DICK, WITH A BLACK EYE AND STAINS ON HIS SHIRT SITS ON THE
COUCH.
LYNNE, 21, pretty and sharp, stands over him with a fury in
her eyes.
LYNNE
Two times! Two times I had to drag
you out of that jail like a filthy
hobo!!
DICK
I’m sorry, Lynne...
LYNNE
What? What did you just say?
DICK
I’m sorry, Lynney.

8.
LYNNE
You’re sorry? Don’t call me
“Lynney!” One time is “I’m sorry.”
Two times makes me think I’ve
picked the wrong man! They kicked
your ass out of Yale for drinking
and fighting! Now are you just a
lush who’s going to hang power
lines for the state? Are we going
to live in a trailer and have ten
children!? Is that the plan?!
Dick looks like he might be sick.
DICK
Can we please... discuss this
later?
LYNNE
No. We discuss it right now while
you smell of piss and cheap booze!
EDNA, Lynne’s Mom, starts to walk in.
EDNA
Does Dick want some coffee?
LYNNE
Mother get out! Does Dick want some
coffee? Jesus Christ!
(back to Dick)
Here’s my plan. Either you stand up
and put your back straight and have
the courage to become someone or I
am gone! There are a dozen men and
a few Professors at school who
would date me!
DICK
I love you, Lynne. I’ve loved you
since the day I first saw you.
LYNNE
Then prove it! I can’t go to a big
Ivy League school! I can’t run a
company or be Mayor! That’s just
the way the world is for a girl! I
need you! And right now you’re a
big fat piss soaked zero!
(beat while she reloads)
I’ve seen my Mother waiting up all
night for my Father to come home.
(MORE)

9.
LYNNE (CONT'D)
And I’ve seen him drunk in this
house raising his voice and way
worse, and I’m not dancing that
dance anymore... I’m not!
QUICK FLASH BACK to Lynne’s FATHER yelling at her MOTHER in
the kitchen. Her dad is scary and has been drinking.
LYNNE (CONT’D)
Can you change? Or am I wasting my
goddamn time?
Beat as Dick looks up. There is a GROWLING DETERMINATION IN
HIS EYES.
DICK
I won’t ever disappoint you again
Lynne.

MAIN TITLE: VICE
INT. RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
A theater with a podium is filled with FELLOWS from around
the country. A MONOTONE CONGRESSMAN, 73 finishes a speech.
MONOTONE CONGRESSMAN
You are America’s best and
brightest. God bless you all... and
God bless... this great nation.

10.
The 100 or so interns looked bored. A few clap politely.
Cheney looks like he’s made a big mistake coming to DC.
MONOTONE CONGRESSMAN (CONT’D)
Next up is a young man from
Illinois who’s done quite well for
himself here at the Capitol...
Representative Donald Rumsfeld...
DONALD RUMSFELD, 36, strides over with brash confidence. HE
LIGHTS HIS PIPE and leans on the lectern.
DONALD RUMSFELD
So did Bob tell you this internship
is a great honor? Huh? Did he?
A few people murmur yes.
DONALD RUMSFELD (CONT’D)
Well, it’s not. It’s what we called
in the Navy “a shit detail.”
THE ROOM LAUGHS. Dick Cheney laughs. Rumsfeld oozes charisma.
FREEZE ON RUMSFELD.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Donald Rumsfeld, or Rummy as they
called him, was the former captain
of the Princeton wrestling team...

NAVY AIR FIELD - DAY - 1956

SUPER 8 FOOTAGE: 24 YR OLD RUMSFELD, in front of a jet plane,
removes his helmet, waves to camera and smiles.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Most Congressmen used their power
like an axe, Rumsfeld used his like
a master of the Butterfly knives.
VT: We see expert hands flipping around a butterfly knife.

11.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And like any master if you got in
his way, he would cut you.
VT: The knife slashes someone’s cheek. UNFREEZE: Rumsfeld
continues his speech.
DONALD RUMSFELD
Look, this is an opportunity. An
opportunity to work in the halls of
decision making for the most
powerful country in the goddamn
world. If that doesn’t give you a
hard on I don’t know what will.
Sorry to the few ladies in the
room. They used to not have girls
for this program... but now they
do. Anyway, I’m Don. Whatever you
do, don’t work for Bob over here.
He’s the most boring son of a bitch
in DC.
Bob chuckles, though it didn’t seem like good natured
ribbing.
DONALD RUMSFELD (CONT’D)
That’s it. Now scat! Go get a
Congressman a cup of coffee! And if
his wife calls, he’s always in a
meeting!
The STUDENT next to Dick turns to him. He’s got longish hair
and a mustache.
STUDENT
Hey, I’m Alan. You’re the other guy
from Wisconsin right?
DICK
That’s right...
STUDENT
One of us is supposed to start with
a Democrat, the other with a
Republican. Do you care if I go
with the Dem? I did a lot of work
with the DNC on campus.
DICK
What party was that guy we just
heard?

12.
STUDENT
(looking at the directory)
Rumsfeld is... a Republican.
DICK
Perfect. Because that’s what I am.
INT. RUMSFELD’S OFFICE - MONTHS LATER
Cheney knocks. Rumsfeld smoking a pipe, pours through papers.
He doesn’t answer. Cheney knocks again.
RUMSFELD
Don’t lurk! Come in dammit!
Cheney enters. Rumsfeld doesn’t look up as he talks to him.
DICK
It’s, uh Dick Cheney... Reporting
for work...
RUMSFELD
You’re Congressional relations for
my Office of Economic Opportunity.
And you’ll assist me in my job as
councillor to the President.
Cheney waits a beat.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D)
You want me to pin your mittens to
your sleeves so you don’t fucking
lose em? Go!
Cheney starts to leave.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D)
By the way Cheney, your two DUIs
showed up on your background check.
Don’t worry. I vouched for you.
DICK
Thank you sir.
RUMSFELD
Thanks are for when neighbor Dottie
pulls your pud for the first time.
You owe me.
Yes, sir.

DICK

13.

GO!

RUMSFELD

Cheney nervously exits.
INT. CONGRESSIONAL FLOOR

Make sure he sees this.

He first pitched the idea as
conservative news when he worked
for Nixon as a media advisor.
UNFREEZE: Rumsfeld walks up as the Media Advisor leaves.
DICK CHENEY
Roger wants Nixon to start a
Republican TV news network.
Rumsfeld throws the memo in a waste basket.
RUMSFELD
Forget it. Roger knows TV. But he
doesn’t know politics.
4) Dick and Lynne having dinner with Rumsfeld and his wife.
LYNNE
So I would do this flaming baton
trick and Dick would wait around
with a bucket of water. So I’m at
the State Finals and I throw up the
baton....and it doesn’t come down.
RUMSFELD
Where have you been hiding her
Cheney!?
5) Flipping cards for Nixon in the Oval Office. 6) Flipping
cards for cabinet members.

14.
INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
Rumsfeld continues down the hallway. Cheney follows.
RUMSFELD
You’re quiet. I like that. You’re
not blabbing to everyone what cards
you have. I missed my flush draw a
month ago but everyone still thinks
I have pocket kings. Except maybe
fucking Haldeman.
DICK
I mostly play hearts so I’m notRUMSFELD
No, no, no.
FREEZE
NARRATOR (V.O.)
For a man like Donald Rumsfeld he
only wanted three things from his
lackey: he had to keep his mouth
shut, do what he was told and
always be loyal.
They stop by Rumsfeld’s office.
RUMSFELD
So is it a yes or a no?
Half beat.
DICK
It’s a yes.
RUMSFELD
You don’t even know what the
question is do you?
DICK
I, uh, I assume it wasRUMSFELD
Good. That’s exactly the kind of
“yes” I was looking for.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Cheney had always been a so so
student and a mediocre athlete. But
now finally he had found his life's
calling, he would be a dedicated
and humble servant to power.

15.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY
Cheney enters his office. It’s basically a closet with a
desk, phone and a chair.
STAFFER
Here’s your new office. No windows.
But all you’d see is a bunch of
hippies flipping off Nixon.
He sits down and picks up his phone.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Now at this point you're probably
wondering who exactly I am.
INT. MIDDLE AMERICA HOME - 2011 - DAY
A DAD, 29 and MOM, 28 play with their SON, 2, on the couch.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Well my name is Kurt. My favorite
football team is the Steelers. And
me and my son love watching Sponge

know so much about Dick Cheney,
well let's just say we are kind of
related... We’ll get to that later.

now 3 plays in the background with the TV on.
Intercut phone call:
LYNNE
I am so damn proud of you right now
Dick Cheney... I knew I picked the
right man. I knew it even when I
didn’t...

16.

We did it.

DICK

LYNNE
Have you seen Nixon?
DICK
I did. I met him. Shook his hand.
That impish smile of his.
FLASH TO ACTUAL STILL of Nixon with an odd smile posing for
camera.
DICK (CONT’D)
Pardon my French, but it’s the best
fucking feeling in the world.
LYNNE
I am so proud of you.
DICK
I love you.
LYNNE
WE are proud of you. Your girls are
proud of you.
(to girls)
Are you proud of your Daddy?
Yes!

YOUNG LIZ

INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
Rumsfeld and Cheney are walking down a hallway.
DICK
Now that I’m not just flipping
cards, I have a few ideas-RUMSFELD
(suddenly)
Stop.
They both stop.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D)
You see that door?
He motions to an office door.
DICK
Isn’t that Kissinger’s office?

17.
RUMSFELD
Yes, but I happen to know that
Nixon’s in there right now. Now why
would Nixon not meet Kissinger in
the Oval Office?
DICK
He’s having a conversation he
doesn’t want to go on the record?
Very good.

RUMSFELD

DICK
What’s the conversation?
RUMSFELD
They’re going to bomb Cambodia.
DICK
That’s impossible. That would have
to be approved by Congress and I’m
over there every dayRUMSFELD
Fuck Congress. Unless you’re in it.
Then it’s the greatest deliberative
body on earth. But we’re not, so
fuck it.
DICK
I thought the President campaigned
on ending the war?
RUMSFELD
Shhhh. Listen to me...
GLANCING PIECES OF NIXON AND KISSINGER TALKING: A cigarette
being put out in an ash tray. A polished shoe tapping, etc.
RUMSFELD (V.O.)
Because of the conversation Nixon
and Kissinger are having right
behind this door, five feet away
from us... in a few days, 10
thousand miles away...
EXT. CAMBODIAN VILLAGE - DAY - SAME TIME
A peaceful Cambodian Village goes about it’s day to day life.
We hear a WHISTLING SOUND far above.

18.
RUMSFELD (V.O.)
... a rain of 750 pound bombs
dropped from B-52s flying at twenty
thousand feet will hit villages and
towns across Cambodia...thousands
will die and the world will change
either for the worse or the better.
We SNAP BACK TO THE HALLWAY. Cheney enthralled by the sense
of power and reach Rumsfeld is expressing.
RUMSFELD
That’s the kind of power that
exists in this squat little ugly
building. But screw Kissinger, he’s
over rated. Come on!
MASSIVE EXPLOSION. WE SEE BLOOD AND LIMBS AND HEAR SCREAMS
JUST FOR A SPLIT SECOND, THEN CUT BACK to Cheney still
looking at the office door.
INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - RUMSFELD’S OFFICE - LATER
Dick is struggling to ask Rumsfeld a question.
DICK
So, uh, what do we... I mean are we
against spending, or are we, uh...
RUMSFELD
Come on... Out with it!
DICK
What do we, uh, believe?
Rumsfeld starts to laugh and then laugh harder and harder.
RUMSFELD
“What do we believe?” Good one
Cheney! Good one!
He slams his door shut leaving Cheney standing in the
hallway.
CUT TO:
EXT. BACK YARD - BETHESDA, MARYLAND -

1973

Dick teaches the girls how to string worms on a fish hook.

19.
DICK
We find out what the fish wants,
and in this case it’s a worm, and
then we use it to catch them.
8YR OLD LIZ
So is it a good trick we’re
playing?
DICK
It’s not good or bad. It’s fishing.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Dick had taken a job as a political
consultant for a large financial
firm, where he was finally making
good money. He took the job because
Nixon’s inner circle had had enough
of Donald Rumsfeld.
INT. CHENEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1973
Dick and Lynne have just been awoken by the phone. They are
dazed and tired.

Brussels.
DICK
Wait, what?
INT. RUMSFELD’S OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT
Rumsfeld is tearing up papers and throwing them out.
RUMSFELD
Nixon’s making me permanent
ambassador to NATO. It’s a fuck off
assignment. Kissinger and Haldeman
won. Come with me.
DICK
I have a four and a seven year old.
LYNNE
Tell Don we’re not moving just
because everyone at the White House
hates him!

20.
RUMSFELD
Good boy. I taught you well these
past few years.
DICK
I’m sorry, Don. I really am.
RUMSFELD
Don’t worry. I’m like bed bugs. You
gotta burn the mattress to get rid
of me!
Don hangs up.
CUT BACK TO:
EXT. BACK YARD - BETHESDA, MARYLAND - 1973
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Dick was becoming sharper and
sharper as a D.C. insider, and
Lynne had started to write articles
and explore ideas for her first
novel.
Lynne walks out across the backyard looking ashen.
LYNNE
Dick?... Something terrible has
happened...
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Then, she received news from back
home in Casper.
EXT. LAKE IN CASPER, WYOMING - DAY
By a LARGE LAKE there is a car with both doors left open, a
purse scattered all over and two Dachshunds running around
loose. Police Cars pull up in SLO MO with sirens blaring.
NARRATOR

was found drowned in the local
Caspar Lake. They said her and
Wayne, Lynne’s Dad, had had a nasty
argument an hour before.

21.
EXT. CHENEY HOME IN MARYLAND 1973
Dick holds Lynne in his arms.
LYNNE
(in shock)
She doesn’t swim, Dick. My Mother
doesn’t swim. She never swam.
EXT. GRAVE YARD - FUNERAL - DAY
About 20 MOURNERS including Lynne, Dick, Dick’s parents, Liz
and Mary and yes, Wayne, Lynne’s Father listen to a priest
read from the Bible as a coffin is lowered into the ground.
NARRATOR
There was never a serious
investigation into Lynne's Mom's
death.
THE FUNERAL HAS ENDED. WAYNE IS TRYING TO DO A HANDSTAND FOR
LIZ AND MARY. Lynne stops him.
LYNNE
Dad...Dad...
Dick walks over.
DICK
Girls, Lynne. Why don’t you go to
the car.
LYNNE
(raspy from crying)
Come on. Listen to your Father.
They leave. Dick is intense.
WAYNE
Heya Dick. You catching any fish?
THERE IS A RESOLUTE LOOK IN DICK’S EYES. He stares at Wayne.
WAYNE (CONT’D)
How’s it going in DC?
DICK
Don’t ever go near my daughters or
my wife again.
A tense beat. Then Wayne finally walks away.

22.
WAYNE
(yells)
Big shot! Big shot in D.C. Dick!
Dick stares straight ahead. He has a resolute quiet power
about him. He can feel it.
CUT TO:
INT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - 2003 - MORNING
CLOSE UP: a basket of plain brown donuts, flaking croissants
and one GLORIOUS DANISH WITH A BRIGHT YELLOW CENTER.
HANDS REACH IN and take a few brown donuts, a croissant. BUT
THEY STAY AWAY FROM THE DANISH WITH THE YELLOW CENTER.
Finally, Cheney TAKES THE LARGE TREAT. FOUR WHITE MEN IN
SUITS (CIA AGENT, SCOOTER LIBBY, DAVID ADDINGTON AND PAUL
WOLFOWITZ) ages 35 to 55, all wait for him to speak. The room
is his.
DICK
So what do you got?
The Unseen Man’s hand flips through papers marked CLASSIFIED.
CIA AGENT
(slightly nervous)
Hassan Mustafa Nasr. A cleric based
in Milan, Italy. He’s a member of
Al-Gama’s al-Islamiyya, the group
that killed Anwar Sadat.
SCOOTER LIBBY
That’s the blind sheik, right?
CIA AGENT
There’s some debate at Langley on
whether they’re a threat or not.
They claim to be peaceful now.
He holds up the danish he’s eating.
DICK
I “claim” to be eating healthy.
Everyone laughs a bit too hard.
DICK (CONT’D)
Okay... pick him up.

23.
EXT. STREET IN MILAN - DAY
POV: A DOOR OF A VAN SLAMS OPEN: A CLERIC, 40, with beard,
wearing a Muslim taqiyah (cap) walks down an Italian street.
THREE MEN IN ALL BLACK JUMP OUT, CHASE HIM DOWN AND PULL HIM
INTO THE VAN IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.
CLERIC
NOO! Help! Help me!
QUICK CUTS: 1. Scissors slice off the Cleric’s clothes 2. He
is struck hard in the face 3. A black hood is put over his
terrified bloodied face. 4. A diaper is then put on him.
THE VAN DRIVES AWAY.
BACK TO:

DICK
What’s the next name?

DICK
Nixon forgot the voice activated
recorders were there. He got
sloppy.
LIZ
Mom, is the President being
punished?

24.
LYNNE
The President has a lot of enemies.
Never forget Lizzy: when you get
power they always try and take it
from you. Always.
Yes M’am.

LIZ

LYNNE
I can’t believe this, this is our

I actually think this could be
very, very good news.

EXT. DULLES PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

DICK
The way I see it, any Republican

right now.
RUMSFELD
Nice. Ford called me right before
my flight took off.

You’re still driving this chick

Holy shit. You salty son of a
bitch. You did it.
They clink and drink.
RUMSFELD
Now we have work to do. Kissinger

Mr. PresidentFORD
Come on Henry let’s hear Dick out.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
One of Dick Cheney’s super powers,
was the ability to make the most
wild and extreme ideas sound
measured and professional.
DICK
What if on a unilateral basis, we
all put miniature wigs on our
penises, and we walked out to the
White House lawn, and we jerked
each other off. So, like a puppet
show, but much more enjoyable?
Long pause. Rumsfeld smiles a sly grin.
KISSINGER
I do like a good puppet show.
FORD
I say we do it!

Cheney talks to a YOUNG LAWYER at the OLC.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And as the new Chief of Staff and
with the Presidency weakened by
Watergate, Dick Cheney wanted to
find out exactly how much power did
the President have.
DICK
I would like to reinstate Executive
Authority. How?
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Antonin Scalia, a young lawyer with
the justice department who would
later go on to serve on the Supreme
Court, rocked Dick’s world.
YOUNG LAWYER
Have you heard of the theory of the
unitary executive?
DICK
No, tell me about it.
YOUNG LAWYER
It’s an interpretation a few, like
myself happen to believe, of
Article two of the Constitution
that vests the President with
absolute executive authority. And I
mean absolute.
Cheney and Scalia both smile. This is what Cheney has been
looking for.

The Unitary Executive Theory.

RUMSFELD
Well...there goes the neighborhood.
FORD

Thank you everybody.
TV REPORTER (V.O.)
The Republicans have lost the
Presidency, they are the minority

LYNNE
(whispers)
Talk. Talk.
DICK
I’ll say it again, taxes must go
down, we must ameliorate pain for
the taxes of the working man....and
bring perspicacity to the fore.
Lynne watches, pained. He’s not good at this. The Campaign
Manager leans in.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER
(whispers)
Thank God for name recognition.
DICK
But enough of the horsing around.
Which is of course, what us cowboys
do. So uh, remember, vote Cheney
for Congress. Uhh, thank you and
vote for Cheney in Congress.
LYNNE
Either he drinks next time, or I
do.

Crowd applauds tepidly. Dick walks over to Lynne and his

I don’t want anyone to panic. But I
do believe I have to go to the

But it can be fixed, right?
DOCTOR
If it was up to me you’d drop out

LYNNE
I grew up in Wyoming. But somewhere
along the line Washington DC
stopped listening to real folks

Awkward silence. The Campaign Manager tries to usher her off.
CAMPAIGN MANAGER
Okay Lynne...
The crowd EXPLODES in applause. Lynne pushes the Manager’s

George, he’s got both our votes.

you for getting the House not to
override the President’s veto of
the fairness doctrine.
DICK
Not a problem. Happy to get rid of
any big government regulations.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
The fairness doctrine was a law
from the forties that required any
broadcast TV or radio news to

Let me go see if everything’s okay
over there. Great to see you both.
Love to the girls...
George goes over to the young drunk man and ushers him out.
LYNNE
(quietly)
That’s his son. George W. He’s the
black sheep of the family.
DICK
A little too much unconditional
love.
LYNNE
Can you feel it Dick? Half the room
wants to be us and the other half
fears us. I know George is up next
but after that, who knows?
She rubs her hand against his back.
DICK

I respect the hell out of Reagan...
But no one’s really shown the world
the true power of the American

agreed my Dad would have been reelected if he had taken out Saddam.
DICK
War time Presidents are always
popular.

That they are. That they are.

Yeah, yeah. That could work. I’ll
have to run it by Rove of course.

my wife?
No mere treaty is our union!
Thou shared thy torch’s flame with
mine.
Revealing halls and spires of long
faded empires.
But now I hold aloft mine own fiery
cresset
To make flesh our bond of power.
LYNNE
Dare I?
Dare I let hope’s beak place
gathered bramble
Upon my heart for future’s nest?
Many winters past hath I let this
hope die,
cruel winds silencing tiny birds
needy cries
(MORE)

49.
LYNNE (CONT'D)
Now that it hath arrived I say yea,
yea!
Mine own blood and will, are yours
til pierced be the last soldier’s
breast plate,
spilling open its jellied ruby
treasures!
Lightening Strikes as they embrace and kiss passionately.
CUT TO BLACK.
Back to the Bedroom with non-Shakespeare Dick and Lynne. Long
beat of silence.
So?

LYNNE (CONT’D)

DICK
So...I think we proceed.
LYNNE
What about Mary?
DICK
It’s VP. It’s not the same
scrutiny.
Dick rolls over, finally ready to sleep.
LYNNE
He’s got allies Dick...
Connections. You’re new to his
world. You don’t know the
landscape.
DICK
Well, then I had better run a very
thorough search...
CUT TO:
INT. CHENEY KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY
Liz, Lynne, Mary, Dick’s friend DAVID GRIBBIN and Dick work
on the VP questionnaire. Laptops, papers are everywhere.
DICK
Every stone. Hell, every grain of
sand needs to be looked under for
this questionnaire.
Mary is putting pizzas on the table.

50.
DAVID GRIBBIN
Dick we’re asking for all
financials, all medical, all
interviews, press, writings, legal
records, family medical and family
financials. Any more
“comprehensive” and we’d need a
rubber glove. Sorry Liz.
LIZ
That wasn’t offensive. Should I be
offended?
LYNNE
I’m offended Dave wasn’t worried
I’d be offended.
LIZ
Oh, a rubber glove. Like a
proctology exam. That’s...that’s
disgusting.
The phone rings. Dick answers.
DICK
Hey David. Any thoughts?
INT. LAW OFFICE - VIRGINIA - SAME TIME
David Addington at his desk, phone crook’d in his neck.
DAVID ADDINGTON
One big one.
FREEZE
NARRATOR (V.O.)
David Addington, Dicks main legal
advisor and a huge believer in the
Unitary Executive Theory. He was
known for telling people to their
face that they were stupid.
UNFREEZE
DAVID ADDINGTON
So the Vice Presidency is part of
the executive branch and because
the VP casts tie breaking votes in
the Senate, also part of the
legislative branch, right?

51.

Okay?

DICK

DAVID ADDINGTON
That means the VP is also not part
of the executive or the
legislative.
DICK
So one could argue neither branch
has oversight of the VP?
DAVID ADDINGTON
Not only can “one” argue that, I’m
arguing it right now.
DICK
Brilliant David.
DAVID ADDINGTON
I know! Right?
CUT TO:
EXT. CRAWFORD RANCH - DAY
Cheney and W walk towards a porch with a screen door slightly
ajar at W’s Crawford Ranch.
W BUSH
Rove made me buy this ranch. He
wanted to distance me from my years
at Yale and Harvard. Make me more
of a man of the people for the
election.
Smart.

DICK

They sit. W BUSH eats chicken while Cheney sips his ice tea.
W BUSH
So, we gonna do this thing or what?
Is this happening?
DICK
We’ve found some very interesting
candidates. I think if we could
schedule a three hour window to go
through each one-

52.
W BUSH
No. I meant are you going to be my
VP? I want you.
Beat.
DICK
I’m CEO of a large company. I’ve
been Secretary of Defense, Chief of
Staff... The Vice Presidency is a
mostly symbolic job...
W BUSH
Right, right. I can see how that
wouldn’t be enticing to you.
DICK
However... the Vice Presidency is
also defined by the President. If
we were to have a... different
understanding...
W BUSH
Uh-huh. Go on.
QUICK FLASH: a fishing line going TIGHT.
DICK
I get the sense you’re a, shall we
say, kinetic leader. You make
decisions based on instinct. You’re
very different from your father in
that regard.
W BUSH
(he likes that)
I am. People have always said that.
DICK
Maybe I could handle the more
mundane parts of the job. Managing
the bureaucracy, overseeing the
military, energy, foreign policy...
W BUSH
That sounds good.
QUICK FLASH: a fishing line reels out for another catch.
W BUSH (CONT’D)
I never want to be the kind of team
owner that pulls the starter in the
4th inning. That’s the manager’s
job.

53.
DICK
And one last thing. My daughter
Mary...
W BUSH
Right... Rove told me she likes
girls.
DICK
I know you’ll have to run against
gay marriage for the south and the
mid-west. But it’s my daughter and
that line in drawn in concrete.
W BUSH
So long as you don’t mind us
pushing that messaging. Sure, we’re
okay with you sitting that one out.
I think it’s important for all the
Marys in the world, you know? No
problemo.
DICK
Then I believe this can work.
W raises his glass.
W BUSH
Hot Damn! Well good, let’s
celebrate!
They cheers ice tea.
INT. FRANK ERWIN CENTER - AUSTIN - 2000 - DAY
BACKSTAGE: Dick and Lynne wait behind the curtains while we
hear W Bush speaking.
W BUSH (O.S.)
When I was searching for a Vice
President I turned to the
experience of Dick Cheney.
But I soon realized he was the best
choice. Please welcome, my friend
and my running mate: Dick Cheney!
And his lovely wife Lynne!
The Cheneys enter. On stage we see Dick’s shoes walk towards
the podium. A quick flash of the campaign’s slogan on the
podium: “RENEWING AMERICA’S PURPOSE”

54.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Dick never filled out his own 83
question questionnaire. Full
medical records were never handed
over. No tax or corporate filings,
nothing.
Crowd starts chanting “Cheney! Cheney!”
INT. FOUR SEASONS - AUSTIN - NIGHT
ON SCREEN: November 7, 2000, Bush vs. Gore
Room full of people watching the election results: Don and
Joyce Rumsfeld, Lynne, Mary and Heather, Liz and Philip,
Addington, Wolfowitz etc. In the back of the room Dick talks
to SCOOTER LIBBY.
SCOOTER LIBBY
Gore rescinded his concession.
They’re claiming Florida is too
close to call.
DICK
He can’t fucking rescind his
concession.
SCOOTER LIBBY
He just did. There’s going to be a
recount. What should we do?
Half beat as Cheney processes.
DICK
We play it like we’ve already won.
Which means we need to staff the
White House.
SCOOTER LIBBY
Who’s leading the transition team?
DICK
I’ll do it.
SCOOTER LIBBY
Um, that’s not really something a
Vice President does, is it?
It is now.

DICK

News reporting on election results.

55.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
Gore has called Governor Bush and
retracted his concession.
The room erupts. “No!” “He can’t do that!”
INT. CHENEY KITCHEN - A WEEK LATER - DAY
Addington, Liz, Mary, Lynne, Dick and AIDES work amidst tons
of folders, files, cell phones in the Cheney kitchen..
DICK
Wolfowitz. State or Pentagon?
ADDINGTON
Depends on who your Secretary of
Defense is.
Rummy.
100%
Rumsfeld?

DICK
ADDINGTON
LIZ

MARY
Doesn’t Bush Sr. hate Rummy?
DICK
That’s not a bad thing with W. He
wants to be his own man.
Dick checks his blackberry.
ADDINGTON
Rumsfeld believes in a robust
Executive. That’s good for us on
war powers.
LYNNE
(joking)
Just keep him out of state, he’ll
start World War three.
DICK
Halliburton gave us a 26 million
dollar exit package. Twice as much
as we were hoping for.
LYNNE
They’re no dummies.

56.
Cheney wiggles two fingers around on his right hand.
DICK
Uh. Sorry gang. But I think
perhaps... I should go to the
hospital...
LYNNE
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Everyone circles around Dick.
INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY
MARSHALL
Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons
having business before the
Honorable, the Supreme Court of the
United States, are admonished to
draw near and give their attention,
for the Court is now sitting. God
bless the United States and this
Honorable Court.
The Justices enter, sit. Whip pan reveal: JUSTICE SCALIA.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
December 12th 2000. Antonin Scalia,
remember him? And the Supreme Court
stopped the state of Florida from
completing their recount.
Clips of Washington D.C.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
George W Bush and Dick Cheney were
going to the Whitehouse by a margin
of 537 votes.
EXT. WASHINGTON DC. 2001 - DAY
OVERHEAD SHOT OF A PROCESSION OF 5 BLACK LIMOS DRIVING INTO
THE HEART OF DC.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
Cheney walks the halls of the White House alone.
He stops at a CLOSED DOOR. Looks at it. REACHES OUT AND TURNS
THE HANDLE. Reveal: THE EMPTY OVAL OFFICE.

57.
Dick doesn’t enter but looks at the office for a long beat.
As he stands there we FLASH BACK TO THE DAY DICK FIRST GOT
HIS OWN OFFICE IN THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE AND CALLED LYNNE.
YOUNG DICK
(to baby Mary on phone)
Hey little Mary. My little Mary.
How are you doing?
YOUNG LYNNE
They’re both doing really well.
Except I’m trying to make this
dinner and it’s this, uh, Macaroni
and Cheese that they said was easy,
but it just keeps coming out a
little watery.
YOUNG DICK
It’s the milk, remember. You gotta
add more milk. Yep, make it
thicker.
YOUNG LYNNE
There’s so much I want to say right
now. You just keep doing what
you’re doing. You’re doing so
great.
They laugh.
YOUNG LYNNE (CONT’D)
You have earned something very
special from your wife.
YOUNG DICK
Listen! Listen! I’m buying wine and
I’m picking something up. Chinese?
YOUNG LYNNE
I really love you.
YOUNG DICK
I love you.
They laugh and giggle. And then the memory is gone.
Dick stands in the doorway shrouded in darkness and silence.
INT. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT - A FEW DAYS LATER
Cheney, Scooter, Addington, Mary Matalin, PAUL WOLFOWITZ, 52,
and Rumsfeld all sit in Cheney’s office.

58.
DICK
Scooter, why don’t you let everyone
know the lay of the land?
MUSIC: DRUM BEAT
SCOOTER LIBBY
Of course. As you all know, I’m
Scooter Libby, Dick’s Chief of
Staff...
INT. OVAL OFFICE - WHITE HOUSE
A GIANT HAND PUTS A “GEORGE W BUSH GAME PIECE” (LIKE
STRATEGO) DOWN IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.)
But I’m also a special adviser to
the President.
A GAME PIECE OF SCOOTER APPEARS IN THE ROOM.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.)
Mary Matalin will serve as an
adviser to the VP and to Bush.
GAME PIECE OF MATALIN APPEARS.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.)
David Addington, Dick’s main legal
counsel, will play center field on
all matters relating to executive
power.
GAME PIECE OF ADDINGTON APPEARS.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.)
The President has Alberto Gonzales,
Karl Rove and Karen Hughes as his
team.
GAME PIECES OF THOSE THREE APPEAR.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.)
Quite frankly Gonzales has no clue,
Rove is a hack and Hughes should be
in double A ball.
Their PIECES GET SWEPT OFF THE BOARD BY A GIANT HAND. BUSH IS
NOW SURROUNDED BY CHENEY GAME PIECES.

59.
SCOOTER LIBBY
We will be automatically BCC’d on
all emails the President receives
or sends. As well as have access to
his schedule the second it is set
or changed.
DICK
We’ll also be receiving the daily
intelligence briefing before the
President so we can get inside the
decision curve.
RUMSFELD
Jesus. Bush approved all of this?
DICK
We have... an understanding.
RUMSFELD
What about the emails? Paper
shredders don’t work with emails.
DICK
The entire administration will run
off of the RNC’s private server.
ADDINGTON
And we’ve deactivated automatic
archiving. We’re clean.
SCOOTER LIBBY
Okay, so over at the Pentagon we’ve
got Don as Secretary of Defense.
Paul Wolfowitz, who worked with
Team B in the Ford days, as
Undersecretary of Defense.
More GAME PIECES GO ONTO A GAME BOARD that shows the
Pentagon, DOJ, White House, and all of DC.
DICK
Let’s check what kind of plans they
have to invade Iraq, okay Paul?
PAUL WOLFOWITZ
It’s already in the works.
SCOOTER LIBBY
We’ve got Ashcroft at the DOJ.
State seems to be the only tricky
department. That’s Colin Powell and
his guy Lawrence Wilkerson.

60.
PAUL WOLFOWITZ
We’ve got Bolton over there. He’s a
loose cannon but loyal.
DICK
I want to get Liz in there as well.
Let’s make sure that happens.
SCOOTER LIBBY
Consider it done.
(back to business)
And this list of “our” people
doesn’t include about 800 others
lobbyists and industry insiders we
placed in the regulatory jobs.
The game board is flooded with pieces everywhere. Some of
them have corporate logos on them.
RUMSFELD
Hey. What did you do with W’s
friends? Pataki, Ridge, Thompson? I
didn’t hear their names.
DICK
They were not offered jobs in this
administration at this time.
RUMSFELD
“Were not offered jobs at this
time?” Have you gotten more
ruthless Dick!? You must not be
getting laid!
Beat. It gets uncomfortable for a second.
Moving on!

SCOOTER LIBBY

INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAYS - LATER
Don and Dick walk through the hallways together just like old
times.
DICK
Listen Don, you haven’t been here
in over 20 years. Times have
changed. The softer touch is the
norm now. We have the conservative
radio and TV doing the yelling for
us.

61.
RUMSFELD
Is your old friend embarrassing
you? Is that it Dick?
DICK
Soft touch, that’s all.
(looks at watch)
Alright. I have to go to my office
over at the House of
Representatives.
RUMSFELD
You mean the Senate? Vice President
is the tie breaker in the Senate.
DICK
No. I mean the House.
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
QUICK FLASHES of a car racing around Capital Hill.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Dick Cheney had used an old
connection with former wrestling
coach and speaker of the house
Dennis Hastert to get an office at
the House of Representatives. The
house is where revenue bills
originate and he wanted to be near
the money faucet.
INT. HALLWAYS OF THE CAPITOL - DAY
SPED UP TRACKING SHOT down the halls of the Capitol.
Tracking stops, door opens. It’s DENNIS HASTERT, 60.
DENNIS HASTERT
Hey Dick! Will this work for you?
Camera TRACKS AWAY SUPER FAST AGAIN DOWN HALLS TO THE SENATE.
INTERCUT: Curt the Narrator jogging and camera fast tracks
through Capital Hill.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And not one, but two offices at the
Senate...
Door opens and SENATOR TRENT LOTT is there.

62.
TRENT LOTT
Hey Dick. I found this extra office
for you.
Camera tracks away FAST AGAIN.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
One in the Pentagon...
Down a HALLWAY OF THE PENTAGON. OFFICE door opens...
DONALD RUMSFELD
I picked out this one personally.
And I got you a welcoming gift!
Reveal a bottle of Glenlivet on the desk.
CAMERA SPEEDS AWAY AGAIN down the hall.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And later when Cheney’s team was
combing through the intelligence on
Iraq, a conference room at the CIA.
CAMERA SPEEDS DOWN HALLWAY TO OPEN DOOR. GEORGE TENET 57, the
garrulous head of the CIA stands inside.
GEORGE TENET
The room is soundproof and secure
Mr. Vice President.
SPEEDS AWAY AGAIN...
GAME BOARD: ONE PARTICULAR BUILDING LIGHTS UP.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
But there was one relatively new
think tank that had become the
place to be in Washington DC.
Americans for Tax Reform.
INT. BIG CONFERENCE ROOM WITH PODIUM AT THE FRONT - DAY
HUNDREDS OF GOP CONGRESSMEN, LOBBYISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE
RIGHT WING MEDIA are seated and waiting.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Grover Norquist ran the anti-tax
group with huge funding from the
Koch brothers network, big oil and
tobacco.
Dick and Lynne enter and THE WHOLE ROOM STANDS.

63.
NARRATOR
His Wednesday meeting as it was
called had become the center of the
Republican world.
GROVER NORQUIST, 48, roundish, bearded, starts the meeting.
GROVER NORQUIST
Let’s talk about the estate tax.
This has been hard to eliminate
because the tax only applies to
estates larger than 2 million
dollars. But marketing guru Frank
Luntz is here to help...
FRANK LUNTZ, 42 and portly stands up.
FRANK LUNTZ
Hello all. Getting regular people
to support cutting taxes for the
very wealthy has always been very
difficult. But I think we’ve had a
break through...
INT. FOCUS GROUP ROOM - DAY
FRANK LUNTZ, 42, stands in front of a DOZEN REGULAR PEOPLE.
FRANK LUNTZ
The Estate Tax kicks in for anyone
inheriting over $2 Million dollars.
How many of you have a problem with
that?
One guy raises his hand.
FRANK LUNTZ (CONT’D)
Now, how many of you would have a
problem with someone called a
“death tax?”
ALL TWELVE HANDS GO UP
Frank turns to the two-way mirror to give a DOUBLE thumbs up.
Then we flash to another focus group already in progress.
FRANK LUNTZ (CONT’D)
Instead of global warming, which we
all agree sounds very scary, we
call it... climate change?
ALL TWELVE HANDS GO UP

64.
EXT. LINE OF CARS STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT - DAY
Track past cars, hearing their RADIOS. A mixture of sports
talk, classic rock and a fair amount of RIGHT WING RADIO.
SNIPPETS OF TALK RADIO (V.O.)
Folks, the government is taking
your money AFTER you die!... It’s a
death tax... Death tax... The
liberals want you to pay a tax when
you die! etc.
QUICK CUTS TO WEB PAGES: DRUDGE REPORT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES,
NEWS MAX: “DEATH TAX MUST GO!”
INT. MIDDLE AMERICA HOME - DAY
Kurt the Narrator plays on the floor with his son while Mom
makes lunch in the kitchen. Reports on the Death Tax blares
on the TV with our BLONDE ANCHOR at the desk.
NEWSCASTER (SOT)
The liberals would tax you for
laughing or crying if they could.
NARRATOR
So with one of the biggest media
and political machines every
created behind him, Cheney was able
to squash action Global Warming,
cut taxes for the super rich and
gut regulations for massive
corporations.
CUT TO:
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
30’S FEMALE BLONDE ANCHOR AT A NEWS DESK
NEWSCASTER
And then there was Cheney’s
National Energy Policy Development
Group. His first major test to
expand executive power.
INT. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT - DAY
Libby, Addington and Cheney sit in Cheney’s office.

65.
DICK CHENEY
I don’t understand what the goddamn
problem is! I want to hear what the
energy CEOs need and I’m not
allowed to?
SCOOTER LIBBY
It’s called FACA.
DICK
What the hell is FACA?
DAVID ADDINGTON
It’s the Federal Advisory
Committees Act. Congress got their
panties in a bunch that elected
officials would just let CEOs roll
in and, you know, write the laws.
SCOOTER LIBBY
The Act demands that appropriate
government officials be present.
Tense beat
DAVID ADDINGTON
Hold on a second.
Addington picks up the phone and dials.
DAVID ADDINGTON (CONT’D)
Hello? What’s your name?... Doug?
Doug, how long have you been
working reception at the Department
of Energy? Three months? Perfect.
INT. WHITE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY
CU: NAME TAG READING “DOUG.” Some guy in a Men’s Warehouse
suit, DOUG, 24, sitting in the corner of a conference room.
DOUG
So what am I supposed to do?
DAVID ADDINGTON
Just sit there and be quiet.
Cheney and Addington sit at the large table very far away.
Two men walk in, FACES PIXILATED AND VOICES DISTORTED.

66.
DICK
Hello (BEEP) and (BEEP). How’s
business at (BEEP)?
OTHER MAN
We’re good. (BEEP) has been
performing quite well and (BEEP)
and (BEEP) are quite optimistic.
They all shake hands and have a seat.
ADDINGTON
(pointing to Doug)
Oh, he’s with the Energy
Department.
Doug now listening to music on his head phones gives a
chipper thumbs up.
INT. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP’S HEADQUARTERS - DAY
CU of hands opening a large envelope and removing copies of
maps that are laid on a table.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The details of Cheney's meetings
with the energy CEO's were never
disclosed.
CU on a MAP OF ALL THE IRAQI OIL FIELDS with OIL COMPANIES’
NAMES ON THEM...
NARRATOR
But a freedom of information
request did provide some documents,
including a map of Iraq's oil
fields with all of the oil
companies that would be interested
in acquiring them if “somehow” they
were ever to become available.
We pan over the map. Seeing names like Exxon, BP, Shell etc.
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And then, it happened.
SMASH CUT TO:
TV SCREEN: ACTUAL DiTech Commercial for mortgage
consolidation that was playing on 9/11, is interrupted by
BREAKING NEWS.

67.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
This just in, you are looking at a
very disturbing live shot. That is
the World Trade Center and we have
unconfirmed reports that a plane
has crashed into one of the towers.
INT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF VICE PRESIDENT - 9/11 2001 - DAY
Cheney, Condi Rice and Mary Matalin are watching CNN. ONE OF
THE TWIN TOWERS IS SMOKING. SUDDENLY A SECOND PLANE SOARS
INTO FRAME AND HITS THE OTHER TOWER. Everyone gasps.
CNN ANCHOR (SOT)
Oh my God! That was a second plane!
A second plane has hit the south
tower!!
SECRET SERVICE AGENTS rush in.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Mr. Vice President, we have
credible information that a plane
is headed for the White House at
this moment. We have less than a
minute to get to the secure
underground bunker.
Cheney is transfixed by the smoking towers. He doesn’t move.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D)
Let’s MOVE!!
THE SECRET SERVICE AGENT GRABS CHENEY BY THE BELT AND LIFTS
HIM OFF THE GROUND. Everyone rushes to the door and down
stairs. They make their way into a Cold War era bunker. The
Secret Service Agent straggles behind with another AGENT.
INT. HAIR SALON - SAME TIME
A TV in a hair salon shows that the Pentagon has also been
hit. Lynne is there arguing with her SECRET SERVICE detail.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2
But Mrs. Cheney I’m being told no
one is to go to the White House.
It’s not safe.
LYNNE
I said, you take me to the White

INT. UNDERGROUND WHITE HOUSE BUNKER - 9/11 9:38AM
Cheney, on the phone amidst the chaos, Norman Mineta,
Addington, Condi Rice, Scooter Libby and Karen Hughes and a
few others are there.
STAFFER
That’s right. We’ve got planes in
the air and no where for them to
land. Permission for them to land
in Canadian Airports. International
flights into Newfoundland.
Dick hangs up a call with the President.
STAFFER (CONT’D)
Sir, Don Rumsfeld on 3.
Cheney points to the speaker phone.
That?

CHENEY

He picks up the line.
DICK
You have authorization to shoot
down any aircraft deemed a threat.
Beat.
RUMSFELD
Presidential authority?
DICK
That’s correct. All orders are
UNODIR.
Condi and the Staffer make eye contact.
UNODIR?

CONDI RICE

KAREN HUGHES
Unless otherwise directed.
CONDI RICE
Mr. Vice President are we sure
these are the proper rules of
engagement.

69.
DICK
The country’s under attack, the ROE
is fluid. David?
DAVID ADDINGTON
Yes Mr. Vice President.
Addington leans to Cheney. They talk in hushed tones.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Now we don't know what exactly what
the people in that room were
thinking, but it's safe to assume
that at least one person wondered
why, in the midst of the most
fateful day in American history,
was Dick Cheney talking to his
lawyer?
Karen Hughes tries to get Cheney’s attention.
KAREN HUGHES
(gets off another phone)
...Mr. Vice President, the
Congressional Members you sent to
Mount Weather Emergency Operations
Center want to leave.
No.
Excuse me?

DICK
KAREN HUGHES

DICK
They’re not going anywhere. Just
tell them, we’ve got all the

Yes, sir.

KAREN HUGHES

People running through the streets covered in ash.
INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - WHITE HOUSE - THAT NIGHT
W Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, RICHARD CLARKE 53,
Scooter Libby, Condi and George Tenet all convene.
GEORGE TENET
We’ve picked up chatter from wellknown Al Qaeda operatives
celebrating today’s attack.
RUMSFELD
We shouldn’t rule out Iraq.
CONDI RICE
What’s Al Qaeda’s Leader’s name?
GEORGE TENET
His name is Osama Bin Laden
RICHARD CLARKE
But this is clearly Al Qaeda. I’ve
been tracking their movements for
years. They’re fingerprints are all
over this.
RUMSFELD
Iraq has all the good targets.
RICHARD CLARKE
Iraq has NOTHING to do with this.
RUMSFELD
Richard you don’t know that for
sure-RICHARD CLARKE
I do know that.
COLIN POWELL
Mr. President, if I may,
Afghanistan is Al Qaeda’s
headquarters. This is where our
focus should be.
L/3 “Colin Powell: Secretary of State”

GEORGE TENET
And the CIA would be capable of
taking down the Taliban’s power
structure.
RUMSFELD
With all do respect, George. Mr.
President. We are the Pentagon.
This is what we do.
Don...

CHENEY

Bush looks around the room. Uncertain for a beat.
W BUSH
Okay... We’ll go with Tenet and the
CIA for now.
Tenet gives Rumsfeld a glance. Don is not happy.
COLIN POWELL
I’ll make calls to our allies.
Everyone gets up to leave.
DICK
I think given the current situation
Mr. President, it’s wise that you
and I not be in the same location.
For, uh, COG...Continuity of
Government.
W BUSH
(he looks freaked)
Of course, of course... Hey... Are
we going to be alright?
DICK
Yes sir. We are.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - HOURS LATER
A LARGE HELICOPTER TAKES OFF. Two SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
holding machine guns stand and watch.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
(into his mic)
Angler has taken off to an
undisclosed location. I repeat,
Angler is airborn.

72.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2
Angler? That’s the VP? I thought
only the President could land and
take off from the south lawn?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
What can I tell you? Today’s
fucked.
INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - THAT NIGHT

DICK
This intelligence has been edited,
redacted and reduced.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Mr. Vice President, usually we vet
the daily intelligence threat

Stop. Don’t you dare give me a damn
disquisition on what I cannot hear.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Mr. President a lot of this

SLOW PUSH IN ON CHENEY’S FACE AS HE HEARS THE RAW INTEL BEING

SCORE: A SINGLE LONG DARK NOTE

VOICES
We’re tracking the possibility of
Bio-attacks using serin gas, cow
pox, ebola... There was a post on a
dark web site about mass beheadings in residential
neighborhoods.... Plans were found
outlining the use of infants as
suicide bombs in major airports...
A source has told as asset about
fire bombs targeting hospitals... A
video was captured describing
televised executions interrupting
American network TV... Movie
studios, museums, subways, day care
centers may all be targets... etc.
As we get to a grainy close up of Cheney’s eyes on the screen
we see something that hasn’t been apparent before: FEAR.

NARRATOR
So while Powell, the CIA and their
international coalition toppled the
Taliban and took Afghanistan in a
matter of days... Cheney had found
something much more powerful than
missiles or jet planes.

Sign: “The Office of Legal Counsel.” David Addington sits

DAVID ADDINGTON
Mr. Vice President, this is John
Yoo.
JOHN YOO, 34, an Asian American lawyer with a deliberate
professional manner sits across from them. JAY BYBEE, 48, the
Assistant Attorney General for the OLC is next to Yoo.
JOHN YOO
It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr.
Vice President.
Mmm huh.

DICK (SOT)

DAVID ADDINGTON
The Vice President believes that it
is the duty as Commander in Chief
to protect that Nation. And that no
other obligation whether it be
Congress or existing treaties
supersedes that duty... How do you
feel about that statement?
Beat.
JOHN YOO
I couldn’t agree more.

John Yoo is at the computer. David Addington paces.
Occasionally Bybee walks in with case files.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
John Yoo’s first legal opinion
allowed the US government to
monitor every citizen’s phone
calls, texts and emails without a
warrant. It was a giant legal leap
based on sketchy law at best.
QUICK CUT: Soldiers punch prisoners.

We believe the Geneva Convention is

GEORGE TENET
What exactly does that mean?
ADDINGTON
Stress positions, water boarding,
confined spaces, dogs.
RUMSFELD
We’re calling it enhanced
interrogation.
W BUSH
We’re sure none of this fits under
the definition of torture?
ADDINGTON
The U.S. doesn’t torture.
CHENEY
Therefore, if the U.S. does it, by
definition, it can’t be torture.

Tonight we are offering the enemy
combatant: whereby someone is not a

Which gives them no protection
under the law. We are also have
Extreme Rendition where suspects
are abducted without record, on
foreign soil and taken to foreign

WAITER (CONT'D)
We have Guantanamo Bay which is
very, very complicated but allows
you to operate outside the purview
of due process on land that isn’t
technically US soil, but is under
our control.
DONALD RUMSFELD
That sounds delicious!
WAITER
And there is a very fresh and
delicious War Powers Act
interpretation, which gives the
executive branch broad power to
attack any country or person that
might possibly be a threat. Finally
for desert we have the fact that
under the unitary executive theory
if the President does anything it
makes it legal. In other words you
can do whatever the fuck you want.
So which would you like gentlemen?
DICK
We’ll have them all.
WAITER
Excellent choice.

but you’re confused. Can you tell
me why?
A 60 YEAR OLD MAN in a football jersey answers.
60 YEAR OLD GUY
Don’t we just have to get Osama bin
Laden? He did it. So why are they
calling it a war? A war with who?
19 YR OLD GIRL in a half tee raises her hand.
FOCUS GROUP LEADER
Thank you Mark. Yes Jasmine?
19 YR OLD GIRL
I don’t get what this Al Qaeda is.
Are they a country? Why can’t we
just bomb them?

Interesting. Who else isn’t
entirely sure what Al Queda is?
Most hands go up.
ON SCREEN: These focus groups happened in February 2002. They

France and Germany have said they
won’t join the coalition. Neither
will Israel.
Cheney is quiet.
W BUSH
We went to the wall together. We
prayed together. Israel is one of
our closest allies.
RICE
They said an invasion of Iraq would
destabilize the region, Sir. And
they don’t view Saddam as an
immediate threat.
W BUSH
That’s not good. I really want a
strong coalition for this.
KARL ROVE
I have an idea. Secretary Powell
has the highest trustworthy ratings
of any of us. What if he gave an
address to the U.N. and the
American people to push this over
the finish line?
COLIN POWELL
Karl, I’ve been very vocal, very
vocal, about my reservations about
invading Iraq.
RUMSFELD
Oh Colin, you’re such a nervous
Nellie.
COLIN POWELL
We’re talking about invading a

Yes, sir. I look forward to being

Zarqawi walks toward OSAMA BIN LADEN. They sit and talk.

NARRATOR
A few years later, Dick’s heart
trouble started up again. With no
donor available, he finally found
himself at death’s door.
INT. GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY
Cheney, looking very thin is in a hospital bed with Mary, Liz
and Lynne around him. A DOCTOR is there.

97.
DOCTOR
I wish I had better news. Your
heart just isn’t pumping enough
oxygen to keep his vital organs
alive. Should I call for a
Minister?
LYNNE
No. He’s not going anywhere. Dick
Cheney you are not going anywhere,
do you hear me?!
DICK CHENEY
(raspy)
This may be the one time I can’t do
what your Mother says.
The family laughs while crying.
MARY
I love you Daddy.
LIZ

DICK
I love my girls...

together.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
Our NARRATOR, continues jogging.
NARRATOR
Dick Cheney told his family he was
ready to die and that he wasn’t
afraid. He told them he had lived a
full life. And he had zero regrets
about the choicesA CAR HITS THE NARRATOR IN A CROSS WALK. Throwing him with a
bone crushing thud onto the hard macadam of the street. BLOOD

INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME
The NARRATOR WITH CROSS HATCHED STITCHING ACROSS HIS CHEST,
nude, lays on a morgue slab.
NARRATOR
(to camera)
They say my heart could give him
another ten years. Cheney doesn’t
like to refer to it as someone
else’s heart, he likes to refer to
it as his NEW heart. And even
though I’m dead, it still makes me
feel pretty shitty.
A helicopter lands on the roof of the hospital. A doctor runs
with a cooler.
INT. SURGICAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The SURGEON AND TEAM make an incision in Cheney’s chest.
NARRATOR (V.O.)

against Republican incumbent Mike
Enzi, our Dick was right there to
hopefully see the Cheney legacy of
power continue.
INT. CHENEY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
CU of a phone. We hear a RECORDING OF MAN’S VOICE coming
through the receiver.
RECORDING (SOT)
Are you aware Wyoming Senate
candidate Liz Cheney supports gay
marriage? Her sister is married to
a woman and Liz refuses to support
a constitutional amendment banning
same sex marriage. Don’t you agree,
Wyoming deserves a Senator who
believes marriage is between a man
and a woman.
Liz, in tears puts down the phone.

LIZ CHENEY
(in tears)
These calls went to every house in
Wyoming. Every single house. I
will never win! What are we gonna
do?

Cheney who is running for the

According to one poll she is behind
by double digits. Welcome.
LIZ CHENEY
Thank you for having me here Chris.
And may I point out there are other
polls that have me much closer.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR
Your opponent Senator Mike Enzi
claims you support gay marriage. In
part because you support your gay
sister’s union with her wife. How
do you respond?
LIZ CHENEY
Let me make this very, very clear:
I do not support gay marriage. I
believe marriage is between a man
and a woman.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR
But you’ve always claimed gay
marriage is a state issue. Your
opponent claims this is an
equivocation.
INT. CHENEY’S TV ROOM - VIRGINIA - NIGHT

American People think?
DICK
No..uh...I think you can’t be, uh,
blown off course.
Dick struggles then turns to camera.
DICK (CONT’D)
I can feel your recriminations and
your judgement. And I am fine with
it. If you want to be loved, go be
a movie star. The world is as you
find it. And you gotta deal with
that reality. And there are
monsters in this world. We saw
3,000 innocent people burned to
death, by those monsters. And yet,
you object, when I refuse to kiss
those monsters on the cheek and
say, “pretty please.” You answer me
this, What terrorist attack would
you let go forward so you wouldn’t
seem like a mean and nasty fella? I
will not apologize for keeping your
families safe. And I will not
apologize for doing what needed to
be done, so your loved ones can
sleep peacefully at night.
Dick gets emotional.
DICK (CONT’D)
It has been my honor to be your
servant. You chose me and I did
what you asked.

“It was found that there were “Blackout” periods, when there
were no emails available from the office of Vice President
Cheney.”

give the President almost unlimited power under the unitary

Sorry to interrupt but Mark had
something he wanted to share...
Guy in the Bucs jersey (Mark).
MARK
Yeah, something’s been bothering me
this whole movie and I just figured
it out. This whole thing is
liberal. It’s got a liberal bias.
TERRI
Interesting. Does anyone else feel
this way?
Two other hands go up.
TURNER
This is all facts. I mean, they had
to vet all this, right?
MARK
You would say that, libtard!

105.
TURNER
So because I have the ability to
understand facts, that makes me a
liberal?
TERRI
Guys let’s lower our voices.
MARK
You probably like Killary!
TERRI
Let’s take it down a notch or two
ok?
TURNER
Ok, first of all, Hillary’s
not President! Ok, the
orange cheeto that you hired
is the President. And he’s
ruining the country that you
claim to love!

MARK
Chicken shit!

Mark lunges for Turner. The fight. People jump up and break
