MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM

IN BLACK WE HEAR:
A RAW, GUTTERAL, BLUES MOAN...GROAN...GROWL.
THE BLACK COMES IN TO FOCUS TO REVEALThe blue-black, full moon-of-a-face of MA RAINEY. The source
of this ethereal sound. She opens her mouth to wail and her
imperfect gold teeth sparkle.
EXT. SHOW TENT - GOD’S POV
We look down on a huge “show tent”. People from every
direction, drawn to the magic of Ma Rainey’s sound like flies
to stank, make their way to the event.
- People piled inside busted up jalopies.
- Riding on “buckboard wagons”.
- Dressed in their Sunday best, and even if they don’t have a
Sunday best, it’s been starched and pressed within an inch of
its life.
AT THE ENTRANCE:
The sign reads “The Mother Of The Blues Madame Gertrude “Ma”
Rainey and her Georgia Smart Set”.
We see black hands passing money to other black hands. Day
laborers digging deep into their pockets pulling out their
hard-earned cash.
INT. SHOW TENT
The place is packed with levee camp workers, cotton pickers,
preachers, gamblers, and share croppers. Hard working Negro’s
feeling no pain. Sanctified by her blues, shouting “Well”,
“Tell the truth”, “Go on Ma!”
And center stage, illuminated by the rickety footlights, is
MADAME RAINEY wringing the mess out of them blues. Her
necklace of $5, $10 and $20 gold pieces shining bright. She
and her Jug Band working their number.
MA RAINEY
(sings)
My bell rang this morning, didn’t
know which way to go / My bell rang
this morning, didn’t know which way
to go. / I had the blues so bad / I
sat right down on my floor...

Sweat pours down the ebony faces of the people. Whether
laughter or tears it doesn’t matter. It’s Saturday night and
these folks are colored and there ain’t no better place or
thing to be.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
I felt like going on a mountain,
jumping over in the sea / I felt
like going in a mountain, jumping
over in the sea / When my daddy
stay out late he don’t care a thing
for me...
Daddy, Daddy, please come home to
me. / Daddy, daddy, please come
home to me. / I’m on my way, crazy
as I can be.
The bellow of Ma Rainey’s powerful voice blends into a train
whistle.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
Mmmmnn, mmmn / Mmmmnn, mmmn...
MONTAGE:
A SERIES OF ARCHIVAL IMAGES FROM THE GREAT MIGRATION.
-Black folk on train cars packed to the gills.
-Beat up pick-up trucks, buckboard wagons stacked with
families, a chicken or two and a bunch of hopes and dreams.
-All traveling past Negroes working in the fields. Their
heads pop up, watching their friends and kin leaving the rich
soil of the south for something better up north far away from
Jim Crow.
-The field workers watch the trucks and wagons disappear up
the road fueled by Ma Rainey’s song.
- We see a couple of men hopping aboard a moving freight
train. Doesn’t matter where it’s going, so long as it’s
headed north.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. CHICAGO’S GRAND THEATER
The blinding footlights of Chicago’s Grand Theater as MA
RAINEY slays the crowd! The place packed with Northern
Colored people (formerly Southern Colored people).

MA RAINEY
Daddy, daddy, please come home to
me. / Daddy, daddy, please come
home to me. / I’m on my way, crazy
as I can be.
MA RAINEY with her band and show girls are tearing up the
stage, as LEVEE, young and brash, Ma’s trumpet player, boldly
snatches a solo.
MA RAINEY cuts her eye at LEVEE and snatches back her blues..
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
Hey! Hey Daddy! / Please come home
to me. / Hey! Oh yeah! / I’m on my
way, crazy as I can be.
Her chorus girls begin to dance an exuberant “Charleston”. MA
RAINEY joins them, stretching out!
IN THE WINGS:
DUSSIE MAE, early 20’S, A bronze beauty, Ma’s gal, dances the
show girls routine. She and LEVEE trade looks.
The blue lights hit Ma Rainey’s black sequined dress, she
shimmies and shakes and the crowd roars as the number ends.
EXT. BRONZEVILLE - CHICAGO. 1927.
A SCORCHING HOT SUMMER SUN LOOMS OVER BRONZEVILLE BEARING
DOWN ON THE HEADS AND FACES OF NEGRO FACTORY WORKERS AND DAY
LABORERS HUSTLING TO WORK.
ACROSS TOWN-EXT. AN INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBORHOOD
WHITE shop owners with their customers handling their
business in the sweltering heat. Finding shade in their
doorways and under their awnings as the sun continues to
pound.
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - BOOTH
STURDYVANT, White, 60’S, the manager of the studio, works the
knobs and dials. Preoccupied with money, his prefers to deal
with the colored performers at arms length. He looks down at
IRVIN, White, 40’s, Ma’s manager, a tall, fleshy man who
prides himself on his knowledge of colored artists and his
ability to deal with them.

IRVIN
Testing, one, two, three...Testing,
one, two, three.
STURDYVANT
You got that list?
IRVIN
I got it. Don’t worry about...
STURDYVANT
(over the horn)
You keep her in line. I’m holding
you responsible. I’m not putting up
with any shenanigans. You hear,
Irv?
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS.
IRVIN
Okay, okay, Mel...let me handle it.
IRVIN crosses over to the piano and mindlessly runs his
fingers over her keys.
STURDYVANT
(over the horn)
I’m just not gonna stand for it. I
want you to keep her in line. Irv?
Irv?
EXT. INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBORHOOD
We hear the metal wheels of the “L” rattle along the tracks.
THREE COLORED MUSICIANS descend the “L” platform stairs
toting their instruments. They find themselves in an all
White working class neighborhood. An ICE TRUCK passes as they
hurry across the street trying to ignore the stares and
awkward glances aimed their way. Clearly, hauling those
instruments in the bruising summer heat has been kicking
their asses. They areSLOW DRAG, hauling a bass fiddle.
CUTLER, carrying a trombone case.
TOLEDO, a newspaper under his arm.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO
STUDYVANT enters from the control booth.
STURDYVANT
I’m not putting up with any Royal
Highness...Queen of the Blues
bullshit.
IRVIN
Mother of the Blues, Mel. Mother of
the Blues.
STURDYVANT
I don’t care what she calls
herself...I’m not putting up with
it. I just want to get her in
here...record those songs on that
list...and get her out. Just like
clockwork, huh?
IRVIN
Like clockwork, Mel.
EXT. RECORDING STUDIO BUILDING - ALLEY
The three musicians turn down an alley to the side entrance
of the building.
CUTLER
You ought to have heard Levee at
the club last night, Toledo. Trying
to talk to that gal Ma had with
her.
TOLEDO
You ain’t got to tell me. I know
how Levee do.
SLOW DRAG
Levee tried to talk to that gal and
got his feelings hurt.
INT. RECORDING STUDIO
Door buzzer sounds. IRVIN is immediately on the move to
answer it, STURDYVANT on his tail.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM

STURDYVANT
...and that horn player...the one
who gave me those songs, is he
gonna be here today? I want to hear
more of that sound.
EXT. RECORDING STUDIO BUILDING - ALLEY
IRVIN snatches open the door.
IRVIN
How you boys doing, Cutler?
CUTLER
Oh, fine, Mr. Irvin.
IRVIN
(stepping into the alley)
Where’s Ma? Is she with you?
CUTLER
I don’t know Mr. Irvin. She told us
to be here at one o’clock. That’s
all I know.
IRVIN
Where’s...uh...the horn player?
CUTLER
Levee's supposed to be here same as
we is. I reckon he'll be here in a
minute.
IRVIN
Well, come on in. I’ll show you the
band room. I’ll get you fed and
ready to make some music.
INT. RECORDING STUDIO
IRVIN heads down the dimly lit back Hallway, the men behind
him. STURDYVANT hovering nearby.
STURDYVANT
Where’s Ma? How come she isn’t with
the band?
IRVIN
(on the move)
She’ll be here.

IRVIN stops at the top of THE BASEMENT STAIRS THAT LEAD TO
THE REHEARSAL ROOM and hits the light switch.
IRVIN (CONT'D)
Cutler, here's the list of songs
we're gonna record.
Cutler’s hands are full. Irvin stuffs the paper in his jacket
pocket as the FELLAS head down the stairs.
INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
Darkness. The door swings open. CUTLER, backlit by the
stairway light, steps in and fumbles around for the light
switch. He mashes the “on” button.
IT IS A WINDOWLESS SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. ONCE A STORAGE ROOM. NO
AIR. NO LIGHT. A BENCH, LOCKERS, SOME FOLDING CHAIRS AND
CRATES. BUT THANK GOD THERE IS A CEILING FAN.
The FELLAS ease into the hot ass room.
CUTLER takes off his jacket and hands TOLEDO the song list.
CUTLER
What we got there, Toledo?
CUTLER goes over and pulls the cord of the ceiling fan.
Nothing happens.
TOLEDO
We got...”Prove It On Me”...”Hear
Me Talking To You”...”Ma Rainey’s
Black Bottom” and “Moonshine Blues”
CUTLER
Them ain’t the songs Ma told me.
CUTLER pulls the fan cord again and the fan begins sloooowly
turning. Barely enough to stir the air.
SLOW DRAG
I wouldn’t worry about it if I was
you, Cutler. Ma will get it
straightened out.
CUTLER
“Moonshine Blues.” That’s one of
Bessie’s songs.
TOLEDO
Slow Drag’s right. Let them
straighten it out.

CUTLER
Levee know what time he supposed to
be here?
SLOW DRAG
Levee gone out to spend your four
dollars.
EXT. BRONZEVILLE BUSINESS STREET
A MAN stands on the corner of 44th & S State St, holding a
trumpet. Clearly, a stranger in a new land. He is “country
boy sharp”. His flamboyance is sometimes subtle and sneaks up
on you. His temper is rakish and bright. He lacks fuel for
himself and is somewhat of a buffoon. But it is an
intelligent buffoonery, clearly calculated to shift control
of the situation to where he can grasp it. He is enthralled
by the citified Negroes stylishly dressed, until he turns and
sees a SHOE STORE.
SLOW DRAG (V.O.)
He left the hotel this morning
talking about he was gonna go buy
some shoes. Say it’s the first time
he ever beat you shooting craps.
A DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS and-INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
CUTLER
I ain’t thinking about no four
dollars.
TOLEDO
Let me get a hit of that, Slow
Drag.
SLOW DRAG
Levee sure was thinking about it.
That four dollars liked to burn a
hole in his pocket.
CUTLER
Well, he’s supposed to be here at
one o’clock.
TOLEDO
That’s some good Chicago bourbon!
The door swings open and LEVEE strides in. He drops his
trumpet case on top of the piano, aggravating TOLEDO.

LEVEE
Look here Cutler...I got me some
shoes!
CUTLER
Nigger, I ain’t studying you.
LEVEE ceremoniously pulls the shoes out of the box as if they
were the crown jewels and starts to put them on.
TOLEDO
How much you pay for something like
that, Levee?
LEVEE
Eleven dollars. Four dollars of it
belong to Cutler.
SLOW DRAG
Levee say if it wasn’t for
Cutler...he wouldn’t have new
shoes.
CUTLER
I ain't thinking about Levee or his
shoes. Come on... let's get ready
to rehearse.
SLOW DRAG
(gets a grip on his bass)
I'm with you on that score, Cutler.
I don't want to be around here all
night.
TOLEDO
Ain’t but four songs on the list.
Last time we recorded six.
The “proud rooster” struts about.
LEVEE
Yeah! Now I'm ready! I can play
some good music now!
He sees a side door and goes over to let some air into the
room. He yanks on it but the door is sealed tight.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
Damn! They done changed things
around. Don't never leave well
enough alone.
TOLEDO takes LEVEE’S trumpet off of the piano and plops it
down on the floor.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM

SLOW DRAG tunes his bass.
Note: The thumping and sliding of the bass strings underscore
LEVEE and TOLEDO’s debate. An intricate trio.
TOLEDO
Everything changing all the time.
Even the air you breathing change.
You got, monoxide, hydrogen...
changing all the time. Skin
changing...different molecules and
everything.
LEVEE
Nigger, what is you talking about?
I'm talking about the room. I ain't
talking about no skin and air. I'm
talking about something I can see!
I ain’t talking about no molecules
or nothing.
TOLEDO
Hell, I know what you talking
about. I just said everything
changing. I know what you talking
about but you don't know what I'm
talking about.
LEVEE
That door! Nigger, you see that
door? That's what I'm talking
about. The door wasn't there
before.
CUTLER takes out some papers and starts to roll a reefer.
CUTLER
Levee, you wouldn't know your right
from your left...and damn if that
door wasn't there. Now, if you
talking about they done switched
rooms, you right. But don't go
telling me that damn door wasn't
there!
SLOW DRAG
Damn the door and let’s do this. I
wanna get out of here.
LEVEE
Toledo started all that about the
door. I’m just saying that things
change.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM

11

TOLEDO
What the hell you think I was
saying? Things change. The air and
everything. Now you gonna say you
was saying it. You gonna fit two
propositions on the same track, run
them into each other, and because
they crash, you gonna say it's the
same train.
LEVEE
Now this nigger talking about
trains! We done went from the air
to the skin to the door...and now
trains. Toledo, I'd just like to be
inside your head for five minutes.
Just to see how you think. You done
got more shit piled up and mixed up
in there than the devil got
sinners. You been reading too many
goddamn books.
LEVEE, checking himself out in the broken full length mirror,
admiring his shoes.
TOLEDO
What you care about how much I
read? I'm gonna ignore you 'cause
you ignorant.
SLOW DRAG
Come on, let’s rehearse the music.
LEVEE
You ain't gotta rehearse that...
Ain't nothing but old jug-band
music. They need one of them jug
bands for this.
SLOW DRAG
Don't make me no difference. Long
as we get paid.
LEVEE
That ain’t what I’m talking about,
nigger. I’m talking about art!
SLOW DRAG
What’s drawing got to do with it?
LEVEE
Where you get this nigger from
Cutler? He sound like one of them
Alabama niggers.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM

12

CUTLER
Slow Drag, all right. It’s you
talking all that weird shit about
art. Just play the piece, nigger.
If you wanna be one of them...what
you call...virtuoso or something,
you in the wrong place. You ain't
no Buddy Bolden or King Oliver...
you just an ol’ trumpet player come
a dime a dozen. Talking about art.
LEVEE
What is you? I don’t see your name
in lights.
CUTLER
I just play the piece. Whatever
they want. I don't go criticizing
other people's music.
LEVEE
I ain't like you, Cutler. I got
talent!
He opens his case and takes out his silver plated trumpet.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
Me and this horn, we's tight. If my
daddy knowed I was gonna turn out
like this, he would've named me
Gabriel.
He hits a couple riffs.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
I'm gonna get me a band and make me
some records. I done give Mr.
Sturdyvant some of my songs I wrote
and he say he's gonna let me record
them when I get my band together.
LEVEE grabs his sheet music from the trumpet case.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
I just gotta finish the last part
of this song. I knows how to play
real music, not this old jug-band
shit. I got style!
TOLEDO
Everybody got style. Style ain't
nothing but keeping the same idea
from beginning to end. Everybody
got it.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM
LEVEE
But everybody can't play like I do.
Everybody can't have their own
band.
CUTLER
Well, until you get your own band
where you can play what you want,
you just play the piece and stop
complaining. I told you when you
came on here, this ain't none of
them hot bands. This is an
accompaniment band. You play Ma's
music when you here.
LEVEE
I got sense enough to know that.
Hell, I can look at you all and see
what kind of band it is. I can look
at Toledo and see what kind of band
it is.
TOLEDO
Toledo ain't said nothing to you
now. Don't let Toledo get started.
SLOW DRAG
Is you all gonna rehearse this
music or ain’t you?
LEVEE
How many times you done played them
songs? What you gotta rehearse for?
SLOW DRAG
This a recording session. I want to
get it right the first time and get
on out of here.
LEVEE
You all go and rehearse then. I got
to finish this song for Mr.
Sturdyvant.
LEVEE pulls out a pencil and starts working on his
masterpiece.
EXT. RECORDING STUDIO BUILDING
IRVIN, paces, checks his watch.

A pack of white kids runs past, stolen apples and candy in
their hands, a sweat-drenched, whistle-blowing POLICEMAN in
pursuit.
INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
TOLEDO, CUTLER and SLOW DRAG have their instruments in hand,
ready to play.
CUTLER
Come on, Levee...I don't want no
shit now. You rehearse like
everybody else. You in the band
like everybody else. Mr. Sturdyvant
just gonna have to wait. You got to
do that on your own time. This is
the band's time.
LEVEE
Hell, I'm ready if you wanna
rehearse.
He picks up his trumpet.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
I just say there ain't no point in
it. Ma ain't here. What's the point
in it?
CUTLER
“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” AhOne...Ah-two...you know what to do.
TOLEDO plays a short intro and the band strikes up.
LEVEE
Nawh! Nawh! We ain’t doing it that
way. We doing my version.
They come to a raggedy stop.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
That's what Mr. Irvin told me...say
it's on the list he gave you.
CUTLER
Let me worry about what’s on the
list.
LEVEE
What kind of sense it make to
rehearse the wrong version of the
song?

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM
SLOW DRAG
You supposed to rehearse what you
gonna play. That's the way they
taught me.
LEVEE
That’s what I’m trying to tell the
man.
CUTLER
You trying to tell me what we is
and ain't gonna play. And that
ain't none of your business. Your
business is to play what I say.
LEVEE
Oh, I see now. You done got jealous
'cause Mr. Irvin using my version.
CUTLER
What the hell I got to be jealous
of you about? The day I get jealous
of you I may as well lay down and
die.
TOLEDO
Levee started all that 'cause he
too lazy to rehearse.
LEVEE
Where's the paper? Look at the
paper! See what it say. Gonna tell
me I'm too lazy to rehearse.
CUTLER
We ain't talking about the paper.
We talking about you understanding
where you fit in when you around
here. You just play what I say.
LEVEE
I don't care what you play! Mr.
Irvin gonna straighten it up! I
don't care what you play.
IRVIN barges in.
IRVIN
Any of you boys know what's keeping
Ma?
CUTLER
Can't say, Mr. Irvin. She'll be
along directly, I reckon.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM
IRVIN
Well, you boys go ahead.
CUTLER
Mr. Irvin, about these
songs...Levee say...
IRVIN
Whatever's on the list, Cutler.
CUTLER
I’m asking about this “Black
Bottom”...
IRVIN
It’s on the list.
CUTLER
Yessir, I know it’s on the list. I
want to know what version. We got
two versions of that song.
IRVIN
Oh. Levee’s arrangement. We’re
using Levee’s arrangement.
LEVEE sits taller, anointed by those words.
CUTLER
Ok. I got that straight. Now this
“Moonshine Blues”...
IRVIN
We’ll work it out with Ma, Cutler.
Just rehearse whatever’s on the
list.
IRVIN exits. LEVEE leaps up.
LEVEE
See, I told you! It don't mean
nothing when I say it. You got to
wait for Mr. Irvin to say it. Well,
I told you the way it is.
CUTLER
Levee, the sooner you understand it
ain't what you say, or what Mr.
Irvin say...it's what Ma say that
counts.
LEVEE
Look, I don't care what you play!
All right? It don’t matter to me.

MA RAINEY’S JOURNEY TO THE RECORDING STUDIO.
INT. COLORED ONLY HOTEL - LOBBY
GERTRUDE “MA” RAINEY DRESSED LIKE SHOWBIZ NEGRO ROYALTY,

LEVEE
We ain't in Memphis. We's in
Chicago. We at a recording session.
Mr. Sturdyvant and Mr. Irvin say
what's gonna be here!
CUTLER
Levee's confused about who the boss
is. He don't know Ma's the boss.
LEVEE
Ma's the boss on the road!
MA USHERS A NERVOUS SYLVESTER TO THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CAR,
A BELLMAN OPENS THE DOOR. SHE SASHAYS AROUND TO THE PASSENGER
SIDE, INSTRUCTING SYLVESTER TO TIP THE BELLMAN WHO HOLDS THE
DOOR FOR HIM, USHERS HIM INSIDE THEN SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT.
Which brings LEVEE and the band to a stop. END INTERCUT.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
You heard what the man told
you..."Ma Rainey's Black Bottom",
Levee's arrangement. There you go!
That's what he told you. I don’t
know why you all want to pick with

LEVEE plays his rollicking intro.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
That's to get the people's

LEVEE
You all got to keep up now! You
playing in the wrong time.
CUTLER
Nigger, will you let us play this
song? I was playing music before
you was born. Gonna tell me how to
play. All right. Let's try it
again. Ah-One...Ah-two...
SLOW DRAG
Cutler, wait till I fix this. This
string starting to unravel.
(dripping with sarcasm)
And you know I want to play Levee's
music right.
SLOW DRAG begins removing his broken string.
LEVEE
If you was any kind of a musician
you'd take care of your instrument.
Keep it in tip-top order. If you
was any kind of musician...I'd let
you be in my band.
Shhiit!

SLOW DRAG crosses to get a new string passing by LEVEE
brushing his shoe.

create a breeze.
CUTLER
Any man who takes a whole week's
pay and puts it on some shoes-you
understand what I mean, what you
walk around on the ground with-is a
fool! And I don't mind telling him.
LEVEE
What difference it make to you,
Cutler!?

Ain't nothing wrong with having
nice shoes. Look at Toledo.

What about Toledo?

There’s more to life than having a
good time. If there ain’t...then
this is a piss poor life we’re

before you was born, and they gonna
keep having a good time after you
gone.
He riffs. “That’s right.”
TOLEDO
Yeah, but what else they gonna do?
Ain't nobody talking about making
the lot of the colored man better
for him here in America. Everybody
worried about having a good time.
Ain't nobody thinking about what
kind of world they gonna leave
their young’ns. "Just give me a
good time, that's all I want." It
just makes me sick.
LEVEE spits a riff at TOLEDO. “Nigger, please!”
SLOW DRAG
Good times is what makes life worth
living.
TOLEDO
I know how to have a good time as
well as the next man. I said,
there's got to be more to life than
having a good time.

TOLEDO (CONT'D)
I said the colored man ought to be
doing more than just trying to have
a good time all the time.
He puts a period on it. BLOP! “Enough.”
LEVEE
Well, what is you doing, nigger?
Talking all them highfalutin’ ideas
about making a better world for the
colored man. What is you doing to
make it better? You playing the
music and looking for your next
piece of pussy same as we is. What
is you doing?
TOLEDO
It ain't just me, fool! It's
everybody! What you think...I'm
gonna solve the colored mans
problems by myself? I said, we. You
understand that? We. That's every
living colored man in the world got
to do his share. Got to do his
part. I ain't talking about what
I'm gonna do...or what you or
Cutler or Slow Drag or anybody
else. I'm talking about all of us
together. What all of us is gonna
do. That's what I'm talking about,
nigger!
LEVEE considers this...
LEVEE
Well, why didn’t you just say that
then?
TOLEDO, goes back to his newspaper.
CUTLER
Toledo, I don’t know why you waste
your time on this fool.
LEVEE
I ain't gonna be too many more of
your fools.
CUTLER
Boy, ain't nobody studyin’ you.

All right, I ain't nobody. Don't
pay me no mind. I ain't nobody.

Levee, you ain’t nothing but the
devil.
LEVEE
There you go! That's who I am. I'm
the devil. I ain't nothing but the
devil.
SLOW DRAG
I know a man sold his soul to the
devil. Name of Eliza Cotter. Lived
in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. The
devil came by and he done upped and
sold him his soul.
CUTLER
How you know the man done sold his
soul to the devil, nigger? You
talking that old-woman foolishness.
SLOW DRAG
Everybody know. It wasn't no
secret. He went around working for
the devil and everybody knowed it.
Carried him a bag...one of them
carpet bags. Folks say he carried
the devil's papers and what not
where he put your fingerprint on
the paper with blood.
LEVEE
Where he at now? That's what I want
to know. He can put my whole
handprint if he want to!
SLOW DRAG takes charge.
SLOW DRAG
Showed up one day all fancied out
with just the finest clothes you
ever seen on a colored man. Had a
pocketful of money, just living the
life of a rich man. Had him a
string of women he run around with
and throw his money away on. One of
the fellows of them gals he was
messing with got fixed on him wrong
and Eliza killed him.
LEVEE leans in.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM
SLOW DRAG (CONT'D)
And he laughed about it. Sheriff
come and arrest him, and then let
him go. Trial come up, and the
judge cut him loose. Cut him loose
and give him a bottle of whiskey!
Folks ask what done happened to
make him change, and he'd tell them
straight out he done sold his soul
to the devil and asked them if they
wanted to sell theirs 'cause he
could arrange it for them.
CUTLER
Well, whatever happened to this
fellow? What come of him?
That's what I want to know.
SLOW DRAG
Last I heard, he headed up north
with that bag of his handing out
hundred dollar bills on the spot to
whoever wanted to sign on with the
devil.
LEVEE
I sure wish I knew where he went.
He wouldn't have to convince me
long. Hell, I'd even help him sign
people up.
CUTLER
Nigger, God's gonna strike you down
with that blasphemy you talking.
LEVEE
Oh, shit! God don't mean nothing to
me. Let him strike me! Here I am
standing right here. What you
talking about he's gonna strike me?
Here I am! Let him strike me! I
ain't scared of him. Talking that
stuff to me.

All right. You gonna be sorry. You
gonna fix yourself to have bad
luck. Ain't nothing gonna work for
you.

Bad luck? What I care about bad
luck? You talking simple. I ain't

life. Couldn't get no worse. What
the hell I care about some bad
luck? Hell, I eat it everyday for
breakfast! You dumber than I
thought you was...talking about bad

Can't tell a fool nothing. You'll

INT. MA RAINEY’S CAR
MA rides, not so relaxed, in the passenger seat. One eye on
the street signs of this foreign landscape the other on
SYLVESTER who is nervously white knuckling the steering
wheel. DUSSIE MAE sits in the back, ramrod straight, watching
SYLVESTER navigate this beast to their destination.
SUDDENLY: A cacophony of horns...then BAM!
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - HALLWAY
IRVIN opens the door. A delivery boy stands with a box of
sandwiches.
IRVIN
(calls out)
Cutler...you boys’ sandwiches are
up here...Cutler?
STURDYVANT
(shouting from his office
door)
Irv, what’s happening?
IRVIN steps out to pay for the sandwiches when he sees...
EXT. RECORDING STUDIO BUILDING
MA RAINEY and a WHITE POLICE OFFICER (the sweaty one we saw
chasing the kid earlier) in the middle of the street roaring
at each other. DUSSIE MAE and SYLVESTER, MA’S “amen corner”,
right behind.

IRVIN, dashes up to the fracas. And like a referee in a prize
fight, works to keep them apart.
MA RAINEY
Irvin, you better tell this man who
I am! You better get him straight!
IRVIN
Ma, what the hell happened?!
MA RAINEY
Tell the man who he’s messing with!
IRVIN
(to the policeman)
What's going on here? Officer,
what's the matter? What's the
problem?
POLICEMAN
Well...when I walked up on the
incident...
DUSSIE MAE
Sylvester wrecked Ma’s car.
SYLVESTER
I d-d-did not! The m-m-man ran into
me!
POLICEMAN
(To Irvin)
Look, buddy...if you want it in a
nutshell, we got her charged with
assault and battery.
MA RAINEY
Assault and what for what!
DUSSIE MAE
(to Irvin)
See...Sylvester was driving and he
don’t know...
MA RAINEY
Wait a minute! I'll tell you if you
wanna know what happened. Now,
that's Sylvester. That's my
nephew. He was driving my car...
POLICEMAN
Lady, we don’t know who’s car he
was driving.

DUSSIE MAE
That’s Ma’s car!

SYLVESTER
That’s Ma’s car!

MA RAINEY
What you mean you don't know whose
car it is? I bought and paid for
that car.
POLICEMAN
That's what you say, lady...We
still gotta check.
STURDYVANT hurriedly pays the delivery boy and passes the
sandwiches onto Toledo, before flying down the alley. The
crowd of white onlookers thickening.
STURDYVANT
Irv, what’s the problem...what’s
going on? Officer?!
IRVIN
Let me handle it, Mel, huh?!
IRVIN turns STURDYVANT back toward the recording studio and
quickly bounces back to the officer.
POLICEMAN
The guy said the kid ran a
stoplight.
SYLVESTER
What you mean? The man c-c-come
around the corner and hit m-m-me!
POLICEMAN
While I was calling a paddy wagon
to haul them to the station, to
straighten it all out, she gets
aggressive with the other driver...
MA RAINEY
He got ugly with me!
POLICEMAN
...causing a disturbance...
MA RAINEY
I don't know why you wanna’ tell
that lie.
POLICEMAN
Look lady...will you let me tell
the story?!

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM

28

MA RAINEY
Go ‘head and tell it then. But tell
it right!
POLICEMAN
Like I said...as I’m waiting on the
paddy wagon, I turn to hear this
guys side of the story and she
won’t let him get a word in
edgeways. He steps in front of her
to explain his side of the
situation...and she knocks him
down.
DUSSIE MAE
She ain’t hit him! He just fell!
SYLVESTER
...s-s-slipped!
POLICEMAN
He claims she knocked him down...
MA RAINEY
If that don't beat all to hell. I
ain't touched the man!
IRVIN
Okay. Okay...I got it straight now,
Ma. You didn’t touch him.
MA RAINEY
The man was trying to block my
path...I got things to do...he
bumped into me and fell down.
IRVIN
All right, Ma... Officer, can I see
you for a minute?
They step to the side for a private conversation.
MA RAINEY
Flopping on the ground like a rag
doll...I ain't touched the man!
A disapproving white crowd watches MA, watching IRVIN and the
POLICEMAN negotiate.
IRVIN discreetly passes him a wad of bills.
The POLICEMAN pockets the money. He turns to the crowd waving
the gawkers away.

POLICEMAN
Okay...move along! Let’s go...come
on folks, let’s move it...
IRVIN hurries over to MA RAINEY and her entourage, escorting
them down the recording studio alley. Passing STURDYVANT
along the way.
STURDYVANT
What’s going on Ma? What’d you do?
MA RAINEY
Sturdyvant, get on away from me!
That’s the last thing I need...to
go through some of your shit!
Pushes past him and intoINT. RECORDING STUDIO
MA RAINEY marches in like she owns the place.
DUSSIE MAE prances in examining the surroundings.
SYLVESTER, still shaken, ambles over to the piano admiring
it.
IRVIN scurries in behind them.
IRVIN
Here, Ma let me take your things.
(to Sylvester)
I don’t believe we’ve met.
MA RAINEY
That’s my nephew Sylvester, and
that there’s Dussie Mae.
Hello.

MA notices TOLEDO standing there holding the sandwiches.
MA RAINEY

Where’s the bathroom?
IRVIN
It's down that hall.
MA RAINEY
Irvin, call down there and see
about my car. I want my car fixed
today. And why ya’ll keep it so hot
in here? You all want to make some
records, you better get a fan on in
here.
IRVIN
(as he goes)
I got it. I’ll take care of
everything, Ma.

DUSSIE MAE primps in the mirror-fixes herself up-checks her
stockings, her garters.

IRVIN struggles to unplug a portable fan.
IRVIN
I talked to her last night. I got
everything straight, Mel. You just
stay out of the way and let me
handle it.

like she owns the damn

DUSSIE MAE
I ain't never been in no recording
studio before. Where's the band at?
MA RAINEY
They off somewhere rehearsing. Come
here...let me see that dress.
DUSSIE MAE comes over. MA RAINEY pulls her in close.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
That dress looks nice. I'm gonna
take you tomorrow and get you some
more things before I take you down
to Memphis. They got clothes up
here you can't get in Memphis. I
want you to look nice for me. If
you gonna travel with the show you
got to look nice.
DUSSIE MAE
I need me some more shoes. These
hurt my feet.
MA RAINEY
Don't you be messing around with no
shoes that pinch your feet. Ma know
something about bad feet. Hand me
my slippers out my bag over yonder.
DUSSIE MAE fetches Ma Rainey’s slippers from her tote bag. MA
drinking in her every move.

Oh, Lord, these dogs of mine /
They sure do hurt me all the time /
The reason why I don’t know...
Dussie Mae brings the slippers over.

Lord, I beg to be excused / I can’t
wear me no sharp toed shoes / I

Straighten them up and look nice.
Look like a gentleman.

Look at Sylvester with that hat on.
MA RAINEY

Come on over here and leave that
piano alone.
SYLVESTER
I ain't d-d-doing nothing to the pp-piano. I'm just l-l-looking at
it.
We hear faint sounds of the band rehearsing.
MA RAINEY
Well. Come on over here and sit
down. As soon as Mr. Irvin comes
back, I’ll have him take you down
and introduce you to the band...
SYLVESTER comes over.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)

money, you gonna send some of it

new.
DUSSIE MAE peeks out the door. The sound of the band
rehearsing echos through the halls.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
Irvin, what is that I hear? I know
they ain't rehearsing Levee's
"Black Bottom." I know I ain't
hearing that?
IRVIN
Ma, listen...that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Levee's
version of that song...It really
picks it up...
MA RAINEY
I ain't studying Levee nothing. I
know what he done to that song and
I don't like to sing it that way.
I'm doing it the old way. That's
why I brought my nephew to do the
voice intro.
IRVIN
Ma, that's what people want now.
They want something they can dance
to. Levee's arrangement gives the
people what they want. It gets them
excited...makes them forget about
their troubles.
MA RAINEY
I don't care what you say, Irvin.
Levee ain't messing up my song. If
he got what the people want, let
him take it somewhere else. I'm
singing Ma Rainey's song. I ain't
singing Levee's song. Now that's
all there is to it. Carry my nephew
on down there and introduce him to
the band. I promised my sister I'd
look out for him and he's gonna do
the voice intro on the song...my
way.

IRVIN
Ma, we just figured that...
MA RAINEY
Who’s this we? What you mean “we”?
Come talking this “we” stuff. Who’s
“we”?
IRVIN
Me and Sturdyvant. We decided that
it would...
MA RAINEY
You decided, huh? I’m just a bump
on the log. I’m gonna go which ever
way the river drift. Is that it?
You and Sturdyvant decided.
IRVIN
Ma, it was just that we thoughtMA RAINEY
I ain't got good sense. I don't
know nothing about music. I don't
know what's a good song and what
ain't. You know more about my fans
than I do.
IRVIN
It's not that, Ma. It's just more
of what the people want.
MA RAINEY
I'm gonna tell you something,
Irvin...and you go on up there and
tell Sturdyvant. What you all say
don't count with me. You
understand? Ma listen to her heart.
Ma listen to the voice inside her.
That's what counts with Ma. Now,
you carry my nephew on down there
and tell Cutler he's gonna do the
voice intro on that "Black Bottom"
song and that Levee ain't messing
up my song with none of his music
shit. Now, if that don't set right
with you and Sturdyvant then I can
carry my black bottom on back down
South to my tour, 'cause I don't
like it up here no ways.
IRVIN
O’kay Ma...I don’t care. I just
thought-

MA RAINEY
Damn what you thought! What you
look like telling me how to sing my
song? This Levee and Sturdyvant
shit...I ain't going for it!
Sylvester, go on down there and
introduce yourself. I'm through
playing with Irvin.
SYLVESTER
Which way you go? Where they at?
MA RAINEY
Here...I’ll carry you down there
myself.
She puts on her shoes and starts out in a huff.
DUSSIE MAE
Can I go? I wanna see the band.
MA RAINEY
You stay your behind up here. Ain’t
no cause in you being down there.
Come on Sylvester.
DUSSIE MAE flops down in a chair.
IRVIN
Okay, Ma. Have it your way. We'll
be ready to go in fifteen minutes.
MA RAINEY
We'll be ready to go when Madame
says we're ready. That's the way it
goes around here.
She marches out, SYLVESTER close behind.
INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
MA RAINEY and SYLVESTER enter and the band stops. LEVEE
defiantly plays a few more licks. MA dives in, ignoring him.
MA RAINEY
Cutler, this here is my nephew
Sylvester. He's gonna do that voice
intro on the "Black Bottom" song
using the old version.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM
LEVEE
What you talking about? Mr. Irvin
say he's using my version. What you
talking about?
MA RAINEY
Levee, I ain't studying you or Mr.

up the song, Cutler, and you know
it.

I ain’t gonna mess up nothing. Ma
say...

Oh my jelly roll / My jelly roll
Please, baby, let me have it all.

I can say "yessir" to whoever I
please. What you got to do with it?
I know how to handle white folks.
I been handling them for thirty-two
years, and now you gonna tell me
how to do it. Just 'cause I say

LEVEE (CONT'D)
I was eight years old when I
watched a gang of white mens come
into my daddy’s house and have to
do with my mama any way they
wanted.
He pauses.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
We was living in Jefferson County,
about eighty miles outside of
Natchez. My daddy's name was
Memphis...Memphis Lee Green...had
him near fifty acres of good
farming land. I'm talking about
good land! Grow anything you want!
He done gone off of shares and
bought this land from Mr. Hallie's
widow woman after he done passed
on. Folks called him and uppity
nigger 'cause he done saved and
borrowed to where he could buy this
land and be independent.
Pauses.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
It was coming on planting time and
my daddy went into Natchez to get
him some seed and fertilizer.
Called me, say, "Levee, you the man
of the house now. Take care of your
mama while I'm gone." I wasn't but
a little boy, eight years old.
Pauses.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
My mama was frying up some chicken
when them mens come in that house.
Must have been eight or nine of
them. She standing there frying
that chicken and them mens come and
took hold of her just like you take
hold of a mule and make him do what
you want.
Pauses.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
There was my mama with a gang of
white mens.

LEVEE (CONT'D)
She tried to fight them off, but I
could see where it wasn't gonna do
her any good. I didn't know what
they were doing to her...but I
figured whatever it was they may as
well do to me, too. My daddy had a
knife that he kept around there for
hunting and working and whatnot. I
knew where he kept it and I went
and got it. I'm gonna show you how
spooked up I was by the white man.
I tried my damndest to cut one of
them's throat! I hit him on the
shoulder with it. He reached back
and grabbed hold of that knife and
whacked me across the chest with
it.
LEVEE raises his shirt to show a long ugly scar.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
That's what made them stop. They
was scared I was gonna bleed to
death. My mama wrapped a sheet
around me and carried me two miles
down to the Furlow place and they
drove me up to Doc Albans. He was
waiting on a calf to be born, and
say he ain't had time to see me.
They carried me up to Miss Etta,
the midwife, and she fixed me up.
My daddy came back and acted like
he done accepted the facts of what
happened. But he got the names of
them mens from mama. He found out
who they was and then we announced
we was moving out of that county.
Said good-bye to everybody...all
the neighbors. My daddy went and
smiled in the face of one of them
crackers who had been with my mama.
Smiled in his face and sold him our
land. We moved over with relations
in Caldwell. He got us settled in
and then he took off one day. I
ain't never seen him since. He
sneaked back, hiding up in the
woods, laying to get them eight or
nine men.
Pauses.

LEVEE (CONT'D)
He got four of them before they got
him. They tracked him down in the
woods. Caught up with him and hung
him and set him afire
Pauses.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
My daddy wasn't spooked up by the
white man. No sir! And that taught
me how to handle them. I seen my
daddy go up and grin in this
cracker's face...smile in his face
and sell him his land. All the
while he's planning how he's gonna
get him and what he's gonna do to
him. That taught me how to handle
them. So you all just back up and
leave Levee alone about the white
man. I can smile and say "yessir"
to whoever I please. I got my time
coming to me. You all just leave
Levee alone about the white man.
There is a long pause, thenCLOSE ON:

the flavors flowing together...then
you got one thing. You got a stew.

You got some leftovers.

singing softly to herself.
SYLVESTER, nervous, is in the corner quietly practicing his

DUSSIE MAE saunters in, “dolled up”, and sits, crossing those
big fine pretty legs, fanning herself. Her dress “scooched

IRVIN
Uh...Ma...the boys say he can't do

IRVIN glances down to CUTLER, who avoids his look.
IRVIN
The band, Ma...the boys in the

MA RAINEY
What band? The band work for me!
IRVIN
He stutters, Ma. They say he
stutters.
MA RAINEY
I don't care if he do. I promised
the boy he could do the part...and
he's gonna do it! That's all there
is to it. He don't stutter all the
time. Get a microphone down here
for him.
IRVIN
Ma...we don’t have time. We
can’t...
MA RAINEY
If you wanna make a record you
gonna find time. I ain't playing
with you, Irvin. I can walk out of
here and go back to my tour. I
don't need to go through all of
this. Just go and get the boy a
microphone.
IRVIN
All right, Ma...we'll get him a

MA RAINEY
Levee...I know you had something to
do with this. You better watch

LEVEE
It was Cutler!
SYLVESTER
It was you! You the only one m-mmad about it.
LEVEE
The boy stutter. He can't do the
part. Everybody see that.
MA RAINEY
Well, can or can't...he's gonna do
it! You ain't got nothing to do
with it!
LEVEE
I don't care what you do! He can
sing the whole got-damn song for
all I care!
MA RAINEY
Well, all right. Thank you.
STURDYVANT
He's only getting one chance...the

MA RAINEY
Damn the cost! You always talking
about the cost. I make more money
for this outfit than anybody else
you got put together. If he messes
up he'll just do it till he gets it
right.
STURDYVANT zips back up to the booth.
She ushers SYLVESTER to his microphone.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
Come on, Sylvester. You just stand

That's real good. You take your

Okay, Ma. We’re all set up to go up

Where’s my Coke. I need a Coke. Hot

Now, just a minute here, Ma. You
come in an hour late...we're way
behind schedule as it is...
MA RAINEY

IRVIN enters.
MA RAINEY (CONT'D)
Irvin, I told you keep him away
from me.
STURDYVANT
I’m tired of her nonsense, Irv. I’m
not going to put up with this!
IRVIN
(to Sturdyvant)
Let me.
IRVIN turns to Ma Rainey.
IRVIN (CONT'D)
Look, Ma...I'll call down to the

We just thought it be easier to go
on and let Levee do it like we
planned.
MA RAINEY
He's doing the part and I don't
wanna hear anymore of this shit
about what the band says. And I
want you to find somebody to
replace Levee when we get to
Memphis. Levee ain't nothing but
trouble.

Levee’s all right. He plays good
music when he puts his mind to it.
He knows how to write music, too.

I don't care what he know. He ain't
nothing but bad news. Find somebody
else. I know it was his idea about

Ma, This Moonshine Blues...that's

MA RAINEY
Bessie what? Ain't nobody thinking

ain't doing nothing but imitating

got mine. I don't care what nobody
else do. Ma was the first and don't
you forget it!

Ain't nobody said nothing about
that. I just said that's the same
song she sang.
MA RAINEY
I been doing this a long time. Ever
since I was a little girl. I don't
care what nobody else do. That's
what gets me so mad with Irvin.
White folks try to be put out with
you all the time. Too cheap to buy
me a coca cola. I lets them know it
though. Ma don't stand for no shit.
Wanna take my voice and trap it in
them fancy boxes with all them
buttons and dials...and then too
cheap to buy me a coca cola. And it
don't cost but a nickel a bottle.
Pause.

They don't care nothing about me.
All they want is my voice. Well, I
done learned that and they gonna
treat me like I want to be treated
no matter how much it hurt them.
They back there now calling me all
kinds of names...calling me
everything but a child of God. But
they can't do nothing else. They
ain't got what they wanted yet. As
soon as they get my voice down on
them recording machines, then it's
just like if I'd be some whore and
they roll over and put their pants
on...ain't got no use for me then.

MA RAINEY
It sure done got quiet in here. I
never could stand no silence. I
always got to have some music going
on in my head somewhere. It keeps
things balanced. Music will do
that. It fills things up. The more
music you got in the world, the
fuller it is.
CUTLER
I can agree with that. I got to
have my music too
MA RAINEY
White folks don't understand about
the blues. They hear it come out
but they don't know how it got
there. They don't understand that's
life's way of talking. You don't
sing to feel better. You sing
'cause that's a way of
understanding life. The blues help
you get out of bed in the morning.
You get up knowing you ain't alone.
There's something else in the
world. Something's been added by
that song. This be an empty world
without the blues. I take that
emptiness and try to fill it up
with something. I ain't started the
blues way of singing. The blues
always been here. But if they wanna
call me the Mother of the Blues,
that's all right with me. It don't
hurt none.

Okay, that's good, Ma. That sounded
great. Good job, boys.
The recording light goes off. Jubilation all around. MA
RAINEY “bearhugs” SYLVESTER.
MA RAINEY
See! I told you. I knew you could
do it. You just have to put your
mind to it. Didn't he do good,
Cutler? Sound real good. I told you
that you could do it.
CUTLER
He sure did. He did it better than
I thought he was gonna do.
IRVIN slides in and quickly pulls Sylvester’s microphone to
the side.
IRVIN
Okay, boys...Ma...let's do
Moonshine Blues next, huh?
Moonshine Blues, boys.
IRVIN starts out butSTURDYVANT
(over the horn)
Irv...something happened. We don't
have the goddamn song recorded!
Heavy moans and groans from everyone.
STURDYVANT (CONT'D)
Check that mic, huh, Irv.
IRVIN crosses over and taps on Ma’s mic.
IRVIN
One...one...one, two...testing,

No, it's the kid's mic.

Christ almighty! Ma, we didn't

What you mean you didn't record it?
What was you and Sturdyvant doing
up there?
IRVIN goes to Sylvester’s microphone, tracing the chord back
to the connection box.
IRVIN
Here...Levee must have kicked the
plug out.
LEVEE
I ain’t kicked nothing!
SLOW DRAG
If Levee had his mind on what he
was doing...
MA RAINEY
Levee, if it ain't one thing it's
another. You better straighten
yourself up!
LEVEE
Hell...it ain’t my fault. I ain’t
done nothing!
IRVIN
It's the cord, Mel. The cord's all
chewed up. We need another cord.
MA RAINEY
This is the most disorganized...
MA RAINEY marches across the room to get her things.
SYLVESTER and DUSSIE MAE in her tail wind.

In an instant he’s right behind her.
EXT. RECORDING STUDIO BUILDING - ALLEY
MA makes her way up the alley, IRVIN hurries to get in front
of her. She finally stops and stands there fuming.
IRVIN
Ma, listen. These records are gonna
be hits! They're gonna sell like
crazy! Hell, even Sylvester will be
a star. Fifteen minutes. That's all
I'm asking! Fifteen minutes.
After a good strong beat.
MA RAINEY
Fifteen minutes! You hear me,
Irvin? Fifteen minutes...and then
I'm gonna take my black bottom on

IRVIN jubilantly kisses MA RAINEY on the cheek. She promptly
wipes it off as Irvin jets off back into the studio.

A GIANT BLOOD ORANGE LATE AFTERNOON SUN. THE HEAT OF ITS
RELENTLESS RAYS ENGULF THE RECORDING STUDIO BUILDING.
INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
The room is like an oven by now with no air circulating in
the stifling summer heat. TOLEDO and CUTLER share Slow Drag’s
moonshine.
LEVEE is stretched out on the bench, fanning himself with his
sheet music, his trumpet on his chest.
SLOW DRAG
Don’t make no difference to me if
she leave or not. I was kinda
hoping she would leave.
TOLEDO
If I was Mr. Irvin, I'd best go on
and get them cords and things
hooked up right.
CUTLER
If Levee had his mind on his work
we wouldn't be in this fix. We'd be
up there finishing up. Now we got
to go back and see if that boy get
that part right. Ain't no telling
if he ever get that right again in
his life. Nigger, don’t you know
that’s Ma’s gal?
SLOW DRAG
Levee up there got one eye on the
gal, the other on his trumpet.
LEVEE
I don't care who's gal it is. I
ain't done nothing to her. I just
talk to her like I talk to anybody
else.
CUTLER
Your ass gonna be out here scraping
the concrete looking for a job if
you keep messing with her.
LEVEE
I ain't done nothing to the gal. I
just asked her name. Now, if you
telling me I can't do that...then
Ma will just have to go to hell.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM
CUTLER
I’m through with it. Try and talk
to a fool...
TOLEDO
Some mens got it worse than
others...this foolishness I'm
talking about. Some mens is excited
to be fools. That excitement is
something else. I knows about it. I
done experienced it. It makes you
feel good to be a fool. But it
don't last long. It's over in a
minute. Then you got to tend with
the consequences.
LEVEE
That's the best sense you made all
day. Talking about being a fool.
That's the only sensible thing you
said today. Admitting you was a
fool.
TOLEDO
I admits it, all right. Ain't
nothing wrong with it. I done been
a little bit of everything. Gonna
be a bit more things before I'm
finished with it. But I ain't never
been the same fool twice. That's
where we part ways.
LEVEE
But you been a fool. That's what
counts. Talking about I'm a fool
for asking the gal her name and
here you is one yourself.
TOLEDO
I married a woman. A good woman. To
this day I can't say she wasn't a
good woman. I married that woman
with all the good graces and
intentions of being hooked up and
bound to her for the rest of my
life. I was looking for her to put
me in my grave. But you see it
ain't all the time what your
intentions and wishes are. She went
out and joined the church. There
ain't nothing wrong with that. But
she got up there, got to seeing
them good Christian mens and
wondering why I ain't like that.

TOLEDO (CONT'D)
Soon she figure she got a heathen
on her hands. So she left... And I
sat down and figured out that I was
a fool not to see that she needed
something that I wasn't giving her.
Else she wouldn't have been up
there at the church in the first
place. So yeah, Toledo been a fool
about a woman. That's part of
making life.
CUTLER
Toledo, what you call a fool, and
what I call a fool, is two
different things. A fool is
responsible for what happens to
him. A fool cause it to happen.
Like Levee...if he keep messing
with Ma's gal and his feet be out
there scraping the ground. That's a
fool.
LEVEE
Ain't nothing gonna happen to
Levee. Levee ain't gonna let
nothing happen to him.
SLOW DRAG
You just better not let Ma see you
ask her. That’s what the man’s
trying to tell you.
LEVEE
I don’t need nobody to tell me
nothing.
CUTLER
Toledo, all I gots to say is
from the looks of it, from your
story...I don't think life did you
fair.
TOLEDO
Oh, life is fair...It’s just...
LEVEE
Life ain't shit. You can put it in
a paper bag and carry it around
with you. It ain't got no balls.
Now, death...death got some style!
Death will kick your ass and make
you wish you never been born!
That's how bad death is! But you

LEVEE jumps up and tries to muscle the exit door again.
TOLEDO
See, now, I'm gonna tell you
something. A nigger gonna be
dissatisfied no matter what.
LEVEE
(struggling with the door)
Niggers got a right to be
dissatisfied. Is you gonna be
satisfied with a bone somebody done
throwed you when you see them
eating the whole hog?
TOLEDO
You lucky they let you be an
entertainer. You lucky and don't
even know it.
LEVEE
I'm talking about being satisfied
with a bone somebody done throwed
you. That's what's the matter with
you all. You satisfied...sitting in
one place. You got to move on down
the road from where you sitting. As
soon as I get my band together and
make them records like Mr.
Sturdyvant done told me I can make,
I'm gonna be like Ma and tell the
white man just what he can do. Ma
tell Mr. Irvin she leavin'...and
Mr. Irvin get down on his knees and
beg her to stay! That's the way I'm
gonna be! Make the white man
respect me!
CUTLER
The white man don't care nothing
about Ma. The colored folks made Ma
a star. White folks don't care
nothing about who she is...what
kind of music she make.

You let her go down to one of them
white folks hotels and see how big
she is.

CUTLER
Hell, she can't even get a cab up
here in the North. I'm gonna tell
you something. Reverend Gates...
You know Reverend Gates?... Slow
Drag know who I’m talking about.
CUTLER takes the floor.
CUTLER (CONT'D)
Reverend Gates was coming from
Tallahassee to Atlanta, going to
see his sister who was sick at that
time with the consumption. The
train come up through Thomasville,
then past Moultrie, and stopped in
this little town called Sigsbee...
LEVEE
You can stop telling that right
there! Ain't but one train. Ain't
but one train come out of
Tallahassee heading north to
Atlanta and it don't stop at
Sigsbee. The only train that stops
at Sigsbee is the Santa Fe, and you
have to transfer at Moultrie to get
it!
CUTLER
Well, hell, maybe that's what he
done! I don't know! I'm just
telling you the man got off the
train at Sigsbee!
LEVEE
All right...you telling it. Tell it
your way. Just make up anything.
SLOW DRAG
Levee, leave the man alone and let
him finish.
LEVEE
Go on tell it your way.
LEVEE walks out of the band room and into the stairway.

CUTLER (O.S.)
Anyway...Reverend Gates got off
this train in Sigsbee, figured he'd
check the schedule to be sure he
arrive in time for somebody to pick
him up.
INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
CUTLER
All right. While he's there, it
come upon him that he had to go to
the bathroom. The only colored
restroom is an outhouse they got
sitting way back two hundred yards
or so from the station. All right.
He in the outhouse and the train go
off and leave him there. He don't
know nothing about this town...in
fact, ain't never even heard of it
before.
LEVEE (O.S.)
(calls out)
I heard of it! And he ain't got off
no train coming out of Tallahassee
in Sigsbee!
CUTLER
(ignoring him)
The man standing there trying to
figure out what he's gonna do...
Where this train done left him in
this strange town. It started
getting dark. He sees where the
sun’s getting low in the sky and
he’s trying to figure out what he’s
gonna do, when he noticed a couple
of white fellas standing across the
street from this station. Just
standing there, watching him. And
then two or three more come up and
joined the other one. He look
around, ain’t seen no colored folks
nowhere. He didn’t know what was
getting in these here fellows’
minds, so he commence to walking.
He ain't knowed where he was going.
He just walking down the railroad
tracks when he hear, "Hey, nigger!"
Just like that...

He kept on walking. They call him
some more and he just keep walking.
And then he heard a gunshot. He
stopped then, you know.
They crowded around him. He's
standing there, got his cross
around his neck and his little
bible with him what he carry all
the time. They ask who he is. He
told them he was Reverend Gates and
that he was going to see his sister
who was sick and the train left
without him. And they said, "Yeah,
nigger...but can you dance?" He
looked at them and commenced to
dancing. One of them reached up and
tore his cross off his neck. Said
he was committing a heresy by
dancing with a cross and a bible.
Took his Bible and tore it up and
had him dancing till they got tired
of watching him. That's the only
way he...
LEVEE thrusts himself back in the room.
LEVEE
What I wants to know is....if he's
a man of God...then where the hell
was God when all of this was going
on? Why didn't God strike down them
crackers with some of this
lightning you talking about to me?
CUTLER
Levee, you gone burn in hell.

prayers. God take a nigger's
prayers and throw them in the
garbage. God don't pay niggers no
mind. In fact... God hate niggers!
Hate them with all the fury in his
heart. Jesus don't love you,

Talking about burning in hell! God

Oh, yes...uh...Levee. I've thought
about it and I just don't think the
people will buy them...they're not
the type of songs we're looking
for.
LEVEE steps in closer.
LEVEE
Mr. Sturdyvant, sir...I done got my
band picked out and they're real
good fella’s. They knows how to
play real good. I know if the
peoples hear the music, they'll buy
it.
STURDYVANT
Well, Levee...I’ll be fair with
you...but they’re just not the
right songs.
LEVEE
Mr. Sturdyvant, the people is tired
of jug band music. The people in
big cities want something with some
fire to it. Harlem, Detroit, DC...
STURDYVANT
Okay, Levee. I'll tell you what
I'll do. I'll give you five dollars
a piece for them.
LEVEE
I don’t want five dollars, Mr.
Sturdyvant. I wants to record them
songs like you say.
STURDYVANT
Well, Levee, like I say...they just
aren’t the kind of songs we’re
looking for.

LEVEE
Mr. Sturdyvant, you asked me to
write them songs. Now, why didn't
you tell me that before when I
first give them to you? You told me
you was gonna let me record them.
What's the difference between then
and now?
STURDYVANT
Well, look...I’ll pay you for your
trouble...
LEVEE
What’s the difference, Mr.
Sturdyvant? That’s what I want to
know.
STURDYVANT
I had my fellows play your
songs...and when I heard
them...They just didn't sound like
the kind of songs I'm looking for
right now.
LEVEE
You got to hear me play them, Mr.
Sturdyvant! You ain't heard me play
them. That's what's gonna make them
sound right.
STURDYVANT
Well, Levee, I don't doubt that
really. It's just that...well, I
don't think they'd sell like Ma's
records. But I'll take them off
your hands for you.
LEVEE
Mr. Sturdyvant, sir. I don't know
what fellows you had playing them
songs...but if I could play them!
I'd set them down in the people's
lap! Now, you told me I could
record them songs!
STURDYVANT
Well, there's nothing I can do
about that. Like I say, it's five
dollars a piece. That's what I'll
give you. I'm doing you a favor.

STURDYVANT (CONT'D)
Now, if you write any more, I'll
help you out and take them off your
hands. The price is five dollars a
piece. Just like now
LEVEE, stares blankly at STURDYVANT.
Finally, STURDYVANT stuffs the money in LEVEE’s breast
pocket, turns his back on him and is gone in a flash.
INT. BAND ROOM - BASEMENT
LEVEE comes back into the room seething.
THE FELLA’S avoid eye contact with him. It’s clear to LEVEE
that they heard it all. They silently gather up their
belongings.
CUTLER crosses to get his instruments.
SLOW DRAG takes a little nip from his bottle.
TOLEDO heads over to the piano for his things. LEVEE storms
over to get his trumpet and collides with TOLEDO.
LEVEE
Hey! Watch it...shit! You stepped
on my shoe!
TOLEDO
Excuse me there, Levee.
LEVEE takes out his hanky and begins to furiously wipe his
shoe.
LEVEE
Look at that! Look at that! Nigger,
you stepped on my shoe. What you do
that for?
TOLEDO
I said I’m sorry
TOLEDO turns his back to his business.
LEVEE
Nigger gonna step on my goddamn
shoe! You done fucked up my shoe!
Look at that! Look at what you done
to my shoe, nigger! I ain't stepped
on your shoe! What you wanna step
on my shoe for?

CUTLER
The man said he’s sorry.
LEVEE
Sorry! How the hell he gonna be
sorry after he done ruint my shoe?
Come talking about sorry! Nigger,
you stepped on my shoe! You know
that!
LEVEE snatches his shoe off his foot and holds it up for
Toledo to see.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
See what you done done?
TOLEDO
What you want me to do about it?!
It's done now. I said excuse me.
LEVEE
Wanna go and fuck up my shoe like
that. I ain't done nothing to your
shoe. Look at this!
TOLEDO turns and continues to gather up his things. LEVEE
spins him around by his shoulder.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
Naw...naw...look what you done!
He shoves the shoe in TOLEDO’s face.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
Look at that! That's my shoe! Look
at that! You did it! You did it!
You fucked up my shoe! You stepped
on my shoe with them raggedy-ass
clodhoppers!
TOLEDO
Nigger, ain't nobody studying you
and your shoe! I said excuse me. If
you can't accept that...then the
hell with it. What you want me to
do?
LEVEE is in a near rage, breathing hard. He is trying to get
a grip of himself, as even he senses, or perhaps only he
senses, he is about to lose control. He looks around,
uncertain of what to do. TOLEDO has gone back to packing, as
have CUTLER and SLOW DRAG.

They purposefully avoid looking at LEVEE in hopes he’ll calm
down if he doesn’t have an audience. All the weight in the
world suddenly falls on LEVEE and he rushes at TOLEDO with
his knife in his hand.
LEVEE
Nigger, you stepped on my shoe!
He plunges the knife into TOLEDO’s back up to the hilt.
TOLEDO lets out a sound of surprise and agony. CUTLER and
SLOW DRAG freeze. TOLEDO falls backward with LEVEE, his hand
still on the knife, holding him up. LEVEE is suddenly faced
with the realization of what he has done. He shoves TOLEDO
forward and takes a step back. TOLEDO slumps to the floor.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
He...he stepped on my shoe. He did.
Honest. Cutler, he stepped on my
shoe. What he do that for?
Toledo, what you do that for?
Cutler...help me. He stepped on my
shoe. Cutler!
He turns his attention to TOLEDO.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
Toledo! Toledo, get up!
He crosses to TOLEDO and tries to pick him up.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
It's okay, Toledo. Come on, I’ll
help you. Come on, stand up now.
Levee'll help you.
TOLEDO is limp heavy and awkward. He slumps back to the
floor. LEVEE gets mad at him.
LEVEE (CONT'D)
Don’t...Don't look at me like
that...don’t look at me like
that...

GOD’S POV:
LEVEE on his knees holding TOLEDO’S lifeless body.
LEVEE kneels and desperately pulls TOLEDO tighter into his
arms, cradles him like a small child and rocks him.
CLOSE ON HANDS:
-Selecting a record disc.
-Wiping it off.
-Making the final adjustments to the equipment.
AS THE CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL:
An all White Jazz Band lead by a Paul Whiteman-esque
conductor, slightly rotund with a pencil thin mustache, plays
a sanitized rendition of Levee’s song.
