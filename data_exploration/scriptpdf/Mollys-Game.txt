So

EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY
But we don’t know what we’re looking at yet. In front of us
is just a greyish-white flurry with nothing to orient us and
no sound except the whistle of a strong wind at a high
altitude. We won’t know where we are until--

*

--a rocket flies right in front of us--right to left--and
disappears from the frame as fast as it came into it. But we
probably saw it long enough to know it wasn’t a rocket, it
was a world-class skier and we were standing five feet away
as she scorched the last few seconds of her run.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
A survey was taken a few years ago
that asked 300 professionals one
question:

EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)
MOLLY (V.O.)
“What’s the worst thing that can
happen in sports?”

rk

We’re at the bottom of the slope now where the skier we just
saw finished her run with a swoosh, and a hundred or so
spectators gave her a round. The skier snapped out of her
skis, picked them up, pushed up her goggles and looked back
up the slope toward the judges...
MOLLY (V.O.)
Some people answered losing a Game
7 and other people said getting
swept in 4. Some people said-EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
--it was missing the World Cup and
some Brazilians said it was losing
to Argentina. Not just in the World
Cup--anytime, ever, in any contest.

We can see the whole slope now. It looks like a terrible way
to die. It’s a moguls course, meaning that skiers race
through a punishing series of 3-foot mounds of packed snow
and ice, lift-off and execute a mid-air trick, land and run
through another set of moguls, lift-off and execute a second
trick, land and race to the finish.
Spectators and race officials line the sides of the slope.

EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE)
The skier we saw is looking back up the slope and now sees
her scores. Not bad, but not what she needed. She gets
another round from the crowd and a less-than-wholehearted hug
from her coach.
MOLLY (V.O.)
But one person answered that the
worst thing that can happen in
sports was 4th-place at the
Olympics.

So

EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (TOP OF THE SLOPE)
We’re at the top of the mountain where the next skiers are
waiting for their start. One of them has just jumped off the
mountain and into the course.
MOLLY (V.O.)
This is a true story but except for
my own I’ve changed all the names
and I’ve done my best to obscure
identities for reasons that’ll
become clear. I’m Molly Bloom and
right now I’m ranked 3rd in North
America in Women’s Moguls.

rk

EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)

The skier who just started has raced through the first set of
moguls, hits the ramp, which sends her up into mid-air where
she executes a trick and lands back on the course and hits
the second set of moguls.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I have a BA in Political Science
from the University of Colorado
where I graduated Summa Cum Laude
with a 3.9 GPA.
EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (NEW ANGLE)

The skier’s made her way through the second set of
backbreaking moguls and hits the second ramp, which sends her
into the air. We watch the judges examine her trick with
expert eyes and then tap the keys on their laptops.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I got a 173 on the L-SATs. The
median L-SAT score at Harvard Law
School is 169.

EXT. A DIFFERENT SKI SLOPE - DAY
This one’s much friendlier and families are skiing together
in the sun with the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop. A COACH is
working with a 12-YEAR-OLD BOY, showing him the right
mechanics for his push-off.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I was raised in Loveland, Colorado,
about an hour outside Denver or
four hours if it’s snowing. On a
weekend family ski trip when I was
5 I was spotted by a coach.

So

The COACH stopped paying attention to the 12-YEAR-OLD BOY and
became captivated by the sight of a 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL--a
prodigy--who’s just exploded into his field of vision. The
COACH watches and then glances back up the slope where the
girl’s FATHER is standing and watching.
FATHER
(shouting)
Attack it, Molly! Attack it!

The COACH watches as the 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL hits the mini-mogul
section of the run.

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d spend the next 18 years chasing
winter and being coached by the
best in the world.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Runners are competing in a road race and the front of the
pack comes toward us as well-wishers cheer and hand out cups
of water along the sides.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I also ran pretty well.

A 12-YEAR OLD GIRL appears among the runners--both the first
kid and the first female we’ve seen. She’s running alongside
her FATHER and you can tell just by looking at her stride
that this is an athlete.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I was running in a charity 5K when
my back exploded.
12-YEAR-OLD GIRL
(to her FATHER)
Something’s wrong.

*
*

*
*

4.
FATHER
Tough it out.
The 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL gives her father a quick “thanks” glance
that her father doesn’t see before she pulls out several
strides ahead of him and the rest of the men around her.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
The 12-YEAR OLD-GIRL is being prepped for surgery.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I had what’s called rapid onset
scoliosis.

CLOSE ON

An x-ray of a terribly curved spine.
MOLLY (V.O.)
My spine was curved at 63 degrees
and I’d need a 7-hour surgical
procedure that involved--

CLOSE ON

rk

An x-ray of the same spine now fused with steel rods.
MOLLY (V.O.)
--straightening my spine,
extracting bone from my hip, fusing
eleven vertebrae together and
fastening steel rods to the fused
segments.

in

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

The 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL is in a hospital bed, post-op. From her
POV we can barely make out what a DOCTOR is saying to her
FATHER and MOTHER.
DOCTOR
She’s gonna be fine, but I wouldn’t
let her ski anymore. Definitely not
moguls and skiing competitively is
out of the question.

The FATHER is quietly devastated and slumps down on the
closest surface while the DOCTOR and the MOTHER assure him
that “...she’s gonna be fine, she just won’t ski”, etc. We
stay on the 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL’s eyes--she’s clocked her
father’s reaction and even through her post-op morphine haze
her eyes are fighting back.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

5.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I was on skis again in a year,
running moguls in 18 months and by
my 20th birthday I’d made the U.S.
Ski Team.
EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (TOP OF THE SLOPE)
It’s the slope we started at.

So

RACE OFFICIAL
Number 87 up.
(pointing)
56 on deck.

Number 87 takes her place at the starting gate and Number 56
is MOLLY. She’s got earbuds in and a coach is vigorously
rubbing down her legs to keep them warm.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
It’s the last round of qualifying
for the Salt Lake City Olympics.
This is the Champion Run at Deer
Valley.

rk

We can see that visibility is terrible, with snow coming down
diagonally and the wind whistling ominously at this altitude.
MOLLY (V.O.)
The altitude’s 8100 feet and the
pitch is 52 degrees which is the
same as the sides of the Great
Pyramids.

MOLLY stomps on her feet to keep them warm and starts to
loosen her shoulders and neck.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
The wind’s 20-25 miles an hour
blowing left to right. It’s 3-below
zero at the top of the slope and
with 17 skiers in front of me, it’s
gonna be like trying to stick a
landing on a frozen infinity pool.

The COACH points to his ears, indicating that it’s time for
Molly to take out her ear buds. She hands the coach her iPod
as he says-COACH
Kiki blew out of her line. Shannon
was off-balance on her second
landing.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

6.

MOLLY nods that she understands.
MOLLY (V.O.)
He’s talking about Kiki Bandy and
Shannon Keebler, my two toughest
competitors who had significant point
deductions on their final runs-QUICK INSERT
A skier landing slightly off-balance after a trick.
QUICK INSERT

So

Another skier skiing out of her line and scrambling to
recover.
EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY (TOP OF THE SLOPE)
MOLLY (V.O.)
--setting the table for me.

MOLLY snaps her boots into her bindings and taps her skis to
check how they feel.

rk

RACE OFFICIAL
Number 56 up. 44 on deck.
COACH
Go get it, here we go.

MOLLY snaps her goggles down as the Coach steps back. MOLLY’s
all alone now at the top of the mountain, snow blowing around
her.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I can make the Olympic team right
now. And if I have three perfect
runs in Salt Lake--the best runs of
my life--I can beat the Austrians
and the Swiss and have a realistic
shot at the podium. Then the law
school of my choice and then a
start-up. A foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women and also
teaches young girls to ignore most
of their current role models.
RACE OFFICIAL
Competitor ready.
MOLLY (V.O.)
But first this.

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

7.

A small light, accompanied by beeps, blinks red, then yellow,
then-MOLLY jams her poles into the snow and launches herself onto
the slope.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
Good start. My father’s at the
bottom trying to telepathically get
me to check my line.
EXT. SKI SLOPE - SAME TIME (BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE)

So

Molly’s FATHER is looking up the slope-FATHER
Check your line.

EXT. SKI SLOPE - SAME TIME (TOP OF THE SLOPE)

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
I check my line.

MOLLY’S POV

rk

Out of the sea of moguls she’s slashing through her eyes find
the path she’s chosen and, for a moment, it becomes
demarcated for us like runway lights before it goes away.
EXT. SKI SLOPE - SAME TIME (TOP OF THE SLOPE)

*

She’s carving through this minefield, kicking up snow and ice and
not being able to see more than ten feet in front of her face.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
Good snow contact, calm upper-body,
legs together, good shape, no line
deviation and set up for the D-Spin
and--

MOLLY sails into the air and executes a perfect back-flip
with an off-axis twist.

*
*
*
*

MOLLY (V.O.)
--stick the landing. Now two things
you need to know before the second
trick which’ll be a 720.

As MOLLY attacks the next set of moguls we start to gradually
SLOW DOWN THE PICTURE...

(MORE)

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

8.

MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

So

The first is that when visibility
is bad the way it is now, race
officials jam pine boughs in the
snow at the edge of the jump so the
skiers have some foreground depth
reference. The second is that the
tightness of your bindings is
determined by what’s called a DIN
setting. If you’re a beginner your
DIN setting is probably 2 or 3. If
you’re an experienced weekend skier
it’s probably 7 or 8. Mine’s 15. My
boots are basically welded to my
skis. Right...so how does this
happen?--

In semi-slow motion, MOLLY gets airborne for her second trick
and almost as soon as she does, her right ski comes off and
falls to the ground.

*

*

*

All sound except Molly’s voice goes out.

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
It happened because I hit a pine
bough and I hit it so precisely
that it simply snapped the release
on my bindings. Right in that
moment I didn’t have time to
calculate the odds of that
happening because I was about to
land pretty hard on my digitally
remastered spinal cord which is
being held together by spare parts
from an Erector Set.

MOLLY crashes to the ice and snow with terrible impact.

*

*
*

in

We go back to FULL SPEED now with Molly’s other ski
immediately snapping off and skidding away as MOLLY keeps
sliding and flipping over.

We’re still without sound--just the occasional slap of her
helmet on the packed snow. And then her helmet flies off just
before she breaks through--MOS--the wood and wire fence and
into a group of gasping and shouting spectators.
We watch the whole thing again full speed. And we watch others
watch it--SPECTATORS, her COACH, the JUDGES, TELEVISION CAMERAS
and her FATHER...
Sound kicks back in and we hear the gasping crowd along with the
radio crackle of the SKI PATROL and EMTs as they race to the
scene. Molly’s FATHER tries to get to her as fast as he can.
MOLLY’s on her back, unconscious, blood-soaked snow on her
face.

9.

MOLLY (V.O.)
None of this has anything to do
with poker. I’m only mentioning it
because I wanted to say to whoever
answered that the worst thing that
could happen in sports was 4th
place at the Olympics--seriously,
fuck you.

Molly’s Game

FADE IN:

INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT
It’s a modest one-bedroom in West Hollywood and at the moment
it’s all but unfurnished. She’s just moved in and has hardly
any possessions.

TITLE:

rk

The CAMERA FINDS an open carton containing new copies of a
book--Molly’s Game: My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of
Underground Poker--with a glamour-shot of Molly on the glossy
cover. Leaning against the wall is a foam board blow-up of
the book jacket with a banner across it announcing that you
can meet Molly Bloom at a book signing. That’s pretty much
it.

*

*
*

12 Years Later
West Hollywood
5:06 AM

*

Suddenly we hear some kind of muffled commotion coming from
outside in the corridor and down the hall. It’s impossible to
make out what’s being said--it’s all shouted whispers and
confusion.

*

MOLLY opens her eyes, thinking she’s heard something, but now
the commotion has gone away and there’s silence.

*

Suddenly one of her Blackberries RINGS and it startles her a
moment. She answers--

*

in

We come to MOLLY, asleep in her bed. She holds two
Blackberries on her chest as she sleeps. It’s become an old
habit.

MOLLY

other end are 17 blinding flashlights attached to 17
automatic weapons which are trained on her.

AGENT DELAROSA turns to the other AGENTS-Go.

AGENT DELAROSA

The agents head down the hallway and go into the apartment
one by one, just like they were taught at the Academy,
stopping at the door and then turning in quickly--all this as
handcuffs go on Molly.

You’re under arrest for running an
illegal gambling operation, do you

CUT TO:
INT. CLOSE ON A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL

So

She’s the same girl we saw running in the 5K and she’s being
taped on a CAMCORDER. There’s something about this girl.
She’s uncomfortably sexy for her age--a father’s nightmare-but she’s also oddly mature and very serious. Off screen her
FATHER is asking her questions. She answers simply and
evenly.

*
*
*

FATHER (O.S.)
What do you think about the
following concepts? I’m just gonna
run them by you. Marriage.
13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
Hm. It is a trap.
FATHER (O.S.)

rk

Society.

13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
It is a joke.
FATHER (O.S.)

People.

in

13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
I think there’s good and bad. I
think there’s jealousy. A lot of
people are out to get you. I don’t
trust them. I don’t trust people.

The frame freezes with the GIRL’s eyes looking off-screen at
her father.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Every year on our birthdays my
father would interview my younger
brothers and me.
FATHER (O.S.)
Who are the heroes or heroines in
your life? Who do you really
respect?

*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

14.

13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
I don’t have any heroes.

*

FATHER (O.S.)
You don’t have any heroes.
*
*

13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
I don’t. Because if I reach the
goals I set out for myself, then
the person I become, that’ll be my
hero. Because there’s no one I can
look at right now who’s
accomplished what I want to
accomplish.

*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
How’s this for hubris?

Again the frame freezes with the girl’s eyes looking offscreen, almost accusingly, at her father.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
Even by teenage girl standards I
would appear to be irrationally
angry at nothing in particular. It
would be another 7 years before I’d
find out why.

EXT. 405 FREEWAY - NIGHT

The lights of Los Angeles begin to shimmer into view through
the windshield of a Jeep Grand Cherokee.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
After my wipeout at Deer Valley I
decided to take a year off before
law school. Law school’s hard and I
couldn’t spend the first year
thinking about a pine bough. I
needed to go away, sever myself
from reality and come up with a new
plan so I chose Los Angeles, a city
whose entire population has severed
itself from reality.

EXT. SMALL HOUSE IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

MOLLY pulls her lone duffle bag out of the Jeep, throws the
strap over her shoulder, walks to the front door and rings

middle of the night--closer to dawn--and she’s been partying.
The two hug.

MOLLY (V.O.)

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

A long line outside a velvet rope with a bouncer tells us
this club is hard to get into.

INT. CLUB - NIGHT

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I got a job working bottle service
at a club in Hollywood called
Nacional. It was Cuban-themed so my
uniform was camouflage short-shorts
and a white wife-beater.

We take a tour through the club, which is packed and thumps
with music.

MOLLY (V.O.)
The promoter would go over which
record producer was sitting where-which hot designers, which Lakers
and Jolo the Malaysian billionaire
who didn’t drink but who ran a
hundred-thousand dollar bar tab. My
job was to get people to spend much
more money than they needed to.
MOLLY’s attending to a table--

*
*
*

*

So

CUSTOMER
We’ll have a bottle of Sky.
*
*

CUSTOMER
What do guys who look like they
deserve Grey Goose look like?

They have a bottle of Grey Goose in
front of them.

CUSTOMER
Quick. Clever. I like that.

MOLLY
You guys look like you deserve Grey
Goose.

As MOLLY finishes at the table and heads back to the bar-MOLLY (V.O.)
They just spent an additional threehundred dollars, bringing their
total to nine-hundred dollars for
eight dollars and fifty-cents worth
of vodka.

in

MOLLY passes some sexy young women who are hanging out at a
table-MOLLY (V.O.)
But the club doesn’t need you to
buy a bottle, they need you to buy
five bottles. So these girls over
here, they let you buy them shots
for a living. It would be like
waiting in a long line to get into
the Gap so you can pay a onethousand percent mark-up to buy all
the employees a pair of pants.

It’s one of those two-story buildings on the west end of the
Sunset Strip. It’s not a dive but it doesn’t scream firstclass.
MOLLY’s Grand Cherokee pulls into a space next to a silver
Mercedes AMG. MOLLY gets out, dressed for her first day of
work in an office.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I only had one shift a week, I
didn’t want to tell my parents I
was a cocktail waitress and back
then I never turned down an
opportunity to make more money so I
found a second job as an office
assistant and that’s how I ended up
working for Reardon Greene. Reardon
was a partner in Bluerock
Investments. He was a regular at
the club and one night he said--

INT. CLUB - NIGHT

rk

REARDON is at a table drinking with some friends and some
girls. He’s in his late 30’s, not very tall, hair slicked
back, 3-day beard, skull and cross-bones t-shirt and he’s
talking to MOLLY-REARDON
Well how’d you like to get paid to
go to grad school and get a fuckin’
MBA in how life works?

MOLLY (V.O.)
I can’t tell you what my job was.
I’m not saying it’s a secret, I
literally can’t tell you what my
job was. So I made it up.
MOLLY’s sat down in front of an empty desk and regarded it
for a moment. What is she supposed to do? She picks up the
phone and checks for a dial tone.

*

INT. BLUEROCK OFFICE - DIFFERENT DAY

So

She files papers.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I filed contracts using a system I
borrowed from the alphabet, with
“B” following “A” and so forth.

INT. BLUEROCK OFFICES - DIFFERENT DAY
MOLLY (V.O.)
I answered the phone, made coffee
runs, set appointments, made
spreadsheets and showed Reardon
what spreadsheets were.

rk

MOLLY’s pointing at her computer screen and explaining how a
spreadsheet works to REARDON, dressed in his usual fatigues
and skull t-shirt and looking at a copy of LA X-Press. He
puts the paper down next to Molly and tells her--MOS--which
girl he likes.

MOLLY (V.O.)
And ordered call girls.

in

INT. BLAIR’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

MOLLY’s asleep on the couch and we can see through the window
that it’s still mostly dark outside.
MOLLY (V.O.)
But I made four-hundred and fifty
dollars a week on top of the three
hundred I was making at the club,

I remember the day started by being
about bagels.

*

MOLLY
(into phone)
This is (Molly).
REARDON (V.O.)
(over)
Get to the office. Pick up bagels.

So

MOLLY
Do you mean now?
(pause)
Hello?

Reardon’s hung up. MOLLY hits a button on the phone to check
the time--5:25AM.

*

EXT. PINK DOT - EARLY MORNING

MOLLY comes out of the store with a bag of bagels.

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
Reardon was a Hollywood staple.
Over-leveraged, into the company
assets, going broke trying to prove
he wasn’t broke and making a true
effort to be as vulgar as possible.
Honestly making an effort.

She’s gotten into her jeep and her phone Buzzes with a text
from Reardon--

*

*
*
*
*

“Move your fuckin’ ass”

*
*

INT. REARDON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

*

REARDON is hammering home a deal to three INVESTORS, telling
them they’d be fuckin’ idiots not to put money into this.
MOLLY’s sitting and taking notes on her laptop.

*
*
*

in

She tosses the phone aside and pulls the car out onto Sunset,
which is nearly empty because of the hour, but we can see
that LA’s decorated for Christmas.

MOLLY (V.O.)
But somehow he was making hundredmillion dollar deals every day and
I got to watch him do it. “Bizness
Biznessa”, as they say in the
Ukraine. The business of business.

MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I was surprised to learn I
liked it.

*

INT. STAIRCASE - MORNING
MOLLY’s hustling up a flight of stairs with the bag of bagels- *
MOLLY (V.O.)
I hadn’t told anyone that I was a
skier and it was hard not to laugh
when Reardon said--

So

She opens the door at the top of the stairs and walks into-INT. BLUEROCK OFFICES - CONTINUOUS
REARDON is standing there--

*

REARDON
Did anyone ever teach you how to
fuckin’ hurry?
MOLLY

rk

No.

REARDON
What are those?
Bagels.

MOLLY

REARDON snatches the bag from MOLLY--

in

REARDON
Are these from Pink Dot?

MOLLY
It’s on the way from (my house).

REARDON
Seriously? You might as well have
stopped at a fuckin’ homeless
shelter! You might as well have
walked into a motherfucking
homeless shelter and said, “I’d
like a dozen bagels from this
homeless shelter please!” I do not
eat bagels from Pink fucking Dot,
Molly, these are fucking poor
people bagels!

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

21.

REARDON throws the bag at MOLLY’s head and MOLLY easily tilts
out of the way of the throw.

*

MOLLY
From where would you like me to get
your bagels in the future?
REARDON
Forget about the fuckin’ bagels.
Done.

MOLLY

So

REARDON
Except smarten up.
Got it.

Hang on.

MOLLY

REARDON

REARDON disappears into his office for a second--

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
Like I said, the day started by
being about bagels but that would
abruptly change.

rk

REARDON comes back out with a legal pad that he’s writing on
as he scrolls through his phone to find numbers.--

*

in

REARDON
(still writing)
We’re doing a poker game at the
Viper Room. Tomorrow night and then
every Tuesday night. You’ll help
run it. Take these names and
numbers and invite them. Tell ‘em
to bring ten grand in cash for the
first buy-in, the blinds are
fifty/one-hundred.

REARDON drops the pad on Molly’s desk. MOLLY stares at the
pad...
And Molly?
Yeah.

*

REARDON (CONT’D)
MOLLY

REARDON
Don’t fucking tell anybody.
REARDON disappears into his office.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

22.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d regarded Reardon as a nitwit
when I regarded him at all, but on
that pad were nine names--along
with phone numbers--of some of the
wealthiest and most influential
people in Los Angeles.

*
*

INT. BLUEROCK OFFICES - A FEW MINUTES LATER
MOLLY’s typing away on her Blackberry--

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I put the numbers in my phone and
composed a simple message--

*
*

Molly hits send.

Then puts her phone down on the desk and Googles
“poker/blinds”.
MOLLY (V.O.)
--that there’d be a game tomorrow
night at the Viper Room, there was
a ten-thousand dollar buy-in and
the blinds were fifty and a
hundred.

rk

Molly begins reading about blinds when all of a sudden her
phone starts buzzing with text after text--”I’m in,” “I’ll be
there,” “Yes,” “I’m in”...
MOLLY turns her head and looks at her phone blowing up with
responses.

CUT TO:

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
All nine players confirmed that
they’d be there. Within 90 seconds
of my sending the text.

*

*
*
*
*

EXT. VIPER ROOM - EARLY EVENING

We establish the front of the iconic club before circling
around to the back where the Jeep is parked and MOLLY’s
pulling out a carton of liquor bottles and a cheese platter.
MOLLY (V.O.)
The Viper Room was owned by Bugsy
Siegel in the 40’s back when it was
called the Melody Room and before
his childhood friend Meyer Lansky
had him shot 43 times in the back.

*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

23.

INT. VIPER ROOM/BASEMENT CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING
As MOLLY makes her way through the dark and seedy hallway,
balancing the cheese platter on the carton of bottles.
MOLLY (V.O.)
All I knew was schoolwork and
skiing. I’d always figured
sophistication would be easy to
learn if I ever needed it. My
cheese platter had a sticker that
said, “Cheese: From the Great State
of Michigan.”

So
She goes into--

*

*

*

INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d Googled, “What type of music do
poker players like to listen to?”
and then tried to figure out how to
make a playlist out of one Kenny
Rogers song.

She arrives at--

rk

INT. THE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

--where DIEGO has kicked out the legs of an oval card table
and sets it upright with a slam.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
Diego, a professional dealer, was
setting up the table when I got
there.

in

INT. THE ROOM - A BIT LATER

The room and the table are set up for the game and now we can
hear the thumping music coming from upstairs.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I set up the bar, put out my cheese
platter and positioned myself at
the door where I’d been instructed
to only let in the names on the
list, which I’d memorized. I was
wearing my best dress, which I’d
bought two years earlier at JC
Penny for 88-dollars.

MOLLY stands waiting at the doorway and adjusts herself
slightly.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

24.

INT. VIPER ROOM BASEMENT - A MOMENT LATER
MOLLY (V.O.)
The players started to arrive. I
introduced myself as Molly,
Reardon’s assistant, asked if I
could get them a drink and took
from each of them ten-thousand
dollars in cash.
Through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES

So

--we’ll see the PLAYERS arriving, chatting a moment with
MOLLY--some of them flirting a little and others being matter
of fact--and handing her envelopes. We’ll pay special
attention to one player in particular who we’ll get to know
in a moment--we call him PLAYER X.

*

The final DISSOLVE is Reardon showing up-REARDON
Everybody here?
MOLLY

Yeah.

rk

REARDON
Ugly dress. Ugly shoes.
(calling out)
Let’s play!

INT. VIPER ROOM BASEMENT - A MOMENT LATER

DIEGO the dealer fans 9 cards out on the table and the
players each start picking a card--

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
Diego fanned 9 cards out on the
table and the players chose for
seats.
INT. VIPER ROOM BASEMENT - A MOMENT LATER

A stack of chips gets slapped on the table as an opening bet
and in a -SERIES OF CUTS
--we see cards being dealt, bets being raised, hands being
folded, Molly making a vodka and Red Bull, the final card
being flipped, hands, chips, cards, vodka and Red Bull etc.--

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

25.

MOLLY’s in the corner. She’s standing at a small table with
her laptop open, watching, listening and Googling. We push in
on her slowly, cutting in the action of the game as we go,
all the while hearing the thumping of the music from
upstairs.

*
*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d just finished counting out
ninety-thousand dollars in cash. I
was in a room with movie stars,
directors, rappers, boxers and
business titans. They were going
all-in all the time, burning
through their buy-ins over and
over.

REARDON’s come over to Molly--

*

REARDON
You’re keeping track of the buyins?
Yeah.

MOLLY

REARDON
Where? Where’s the paper?

rk

MOLLY
(pointing to the laptop)
Spreadsheet.

REARDON takes a moment and then nods his approval before we
go back to another

*

SERIES OF CUTS

in

More chips fly in, drinks are put down, cards are flipped,
players jump up in victory and pound the table in defeat,
throw their cards at Diego, the seal on a new deck gets cut,
more buy-ins, more drinks, more chips, more cards and the
thump thump thump of the music from upstairs...MOLLY’s typing
at her laptop.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I Googled every word I heard that I
didn’t know. Flop, river, fourth
street, tilt, cooler, boat, nuts,
playing the rush, cold deck-INT. VIPER ROOM BASEMENT - LATER
The game is over and the room is clearing out--

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

26.

MOLLY (V.O.)
The game ended at 2:30. And when it
did, that’s when Reardon shouted
out-REARDON
(calling out)
Hey! Tip Molly if you want to get
invited back next week.
As players leave they say goodbye to MOLLY, some of them
giving her a kiss on the cheek while they hand her some chips
or some cash.

*
*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
Tip Molly. Deep down I didn’t like
the sound of that. Deep down I knew
that when your boss says--

QUICK CUT TO:

INT. BLUEROCK OFFICES - DAY
--where Reardon says--

REARDON

rk

And Molly?

MOLLY

Yeah.

REARDON
Don’t fuckin’ tell anybody.
CUT BACK TO:

in

INT. VIPER ROOM BASEMENT - NIGHT

MOLLY’s alone counting out hundreds--

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
--that’s usually not the beginning
of a promising law career. But that
was deep down. I’d just made threethousand dollars.

MOLLY stares at the cash in her hands and smiles...

MORNING JOE
MOLLY’s a guest on the show and her book cover--Molly’s Game-- *
is projected in back of them.
MIKA BRZEZINSKI
What’s the most you ever went home
with?
MOLLY
In one night?

So

MIKA BRZEZINSKI
In one night.
MOLLY
A hundred and fifty-thousand
dollars.

CUT TO:

INT. GAGE WHITNEY/WAITING AREA - MORNING

*
*
*

The morning newspapers are fanned out on the coffee table and
in the bottom right corner of The New York Post is a box with
a picture of Molly and a small headline that reads: “Poker
Princess Arraigned Today”. MOLLY casually takes one of the
other papers and slides it over her photo.

*
*

Also sitting and waiting is a 14-year-old girl--STELLA--who’s
dressed in a private school uniform and reading a copy of The
Crucible. STELLA’s the opposite of precocious.

*

in

rk

It’s present day and these are the offices of a high-end,
prestigious law firm. It’s early in the morning and the place
is completely empty except for MOLLY, who’s sitting and
waiting in her best professional clothes. She’s mentally and
physically exhausted but keeps it to herself.

After a long moment of silence...
MOLLY
(pause)
What are you reading?
STELLA
The Crucible.
MOLLY
For school?

STELLA
(shakes her head no)
My father assigned it.

*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

28.

MOLLY nods and there’s another long silence...
MOLLY
(pause)
You know how many witches were
burned in Salem?
STELLA
No. It doesn’t say.

So

MOLLY
None. They didn’t burn witches in
Salem, it’s a myth, that’s not how
they killed them.
STELLA
How did they kill them?
MOLLY
They hanged them or drowned them.
Sometimes they piled heavy stones
on their chests until they crushed
them.
STELLA
You’re Molly Bloom, right?
MOLLY

rk

Yeah.

STELLA
You don’t look like you do in the
pictures.
MOLLY
None of us do.

Molly?
Yes.

in

We hear the clacking of footsteps coming down the hall and
CHARLIE JAFFEY comes into view. CHARLIE’s a nice-looking guy
with a kind face--around the same age as Molly or a couple of
years older. He’s dressed well but not flashy.

*

CHARLIE
MOLLY

CHARLIE
I’m Charlie Jaffey.

MOLLY
Thank you again for seeing me.
CHARLIE
You’ve met my daughter Stella?

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

Yes.

29.

MOLLY

CHARLIE
(to Stella)
Isabel’s gonna be here in 45
minutes to take you to school. Did
you finish the math?
Yeah.

CHARLIE

So

Civ?

STELLA

Yeah.

STELLA

CHARLIE
Do you know it? Could you teach it
to your class today? If I asked you
about Roman law, could you tell me?
Yes.

STELLA

CHARLIE
‘Kay, keep reading.

rk

MOLLY clocked that.

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
(to Molly)
There aren’t too many people here
this early but we’ll have coffee
soon. Come on back to my office.
MOLLY follows CHARLIE down a hallway--

in

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
First thing’s first, when was the
last time you slept?
(beat)
Today’s Friday.

MOLLY
Tuesday morning at 5AM I was
arrested by the FBI. I spent
Tuesday at LA County Jail. I was
assessed to be a minimal flight
risk and my bail was set at a
hundred-thousand dollars. My mother
signed over her house. I was
released Wednesday morning and
ordered to appear in Federal Court
in New York’s Southern District at
10AM today.

CHARLIE

They walk into-INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
It’s a beautiful corner office with jetliner views of the
river.

So

MOLLY
I flew here Wednesday and met with
five attorneys yesterday.
CHARLIE
Why didn’t you hire any of them?
MOLLY
Three of them had already been
taken.
CHARLIE
Yeah, there were 31 people named in
your indictment--it’s Black Friday
for criminal lawyers. What about
the other two?

rk

MOLLY
One told me that money was his
second favorite form of payment.
CHARLIE

Uh-huh.

MOLLY
And the fifth was also taken but he
recommended I call you.

in

CHARLIE
Why?

MOLLY
I told him I wanted someone who’d
worked in the prosecutor’s office.
That didn’t narrow the field much
but then I told him I needed
someone who wasn’t even a little
bit shady because I’ve had some
experience with that and that’s
when the list got short. I told him
I needed someone very good because
this is nuanced. And I was given
one day to find an attorney.

CHARLIE

I’ve been briefed a little by my
daughter who knows a lot about your
story because her mother’s a moron.
MOLLY
The tabloids.

So

CHARLIE
I’ve read some of the tabloids and
I read the indictment after I got
your call last night and I bought
your book.

CHARLIE’s picked up a copy of Molly’s Game--

*

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
I’m only up to page 81, but Molly?
Did you commit a felony and then
publish a memoir about it?

*
*
*

CHARLIE
Just to nail down the timeline, you
ran games in LA for roughly six
years?

*

Yeah.

MOLLY

in

rk

MOLLY
I haven’t run a game in over two
years. Not to spoil the ending but
that’s when the government raided
my game and took all my money,
assuming all of it was made
illegally which it wasn’t. I’ve
been living at my mother’s house in
Keystone and I wrote the book so I
could start paying debts. I just
finished a press tour for the book
and moved back to Los Angeles.

CHARLIE
Without taking a rake.
Right.

MOLLY

CHARLIE
Then you ran games in New York for
roughly two years?

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

32.

MOLLY
I took a rake the last six months.
CHARLIE
Then your game got raided, the
government took all your money in a
civil forfeiture and you left town.
MOLLY
I went to live with my mother at
her house in Colorado. That was two
years ago.

So

CHARLIE
And it was there that you wrote
this book.
Yes.

MOLLY

CHARLIE
The book was released three weeks
ago, you did a press tour and moved
back to LA.
Yes.

MOLLY

rk

CHARLIE
And that’s where you were arrested
by the FBI.
Yes.

MOLLY

CHARLIE
(pause)
So...In the first 81 pages you name
a bunch of names.
MOLLY

in

(beat)
I’m sorry?

*

CHARLIE
You gave up the names of some movie
stars who played in your game.

MOLLY takes a moment...this is obviously a sore spot for her
and she’d rather not talk about it.
MOLLY
(pause)
Yeah.

*
*

33.
CHARLIE
Isn’t that against some sort of
poker code?
MOLLY
There’s no poker code and there’s
no law against lack of discretion.
CHARLIE
Wouldn’t it be great if there were,
though?

So

MOLLY
Are you taking me on as a client?
CHARLIE
My retainer’s $250,000, do you have
$250,000?
MOLLY
No, I don’t have anything.
CHARLIE
What about sales of the book?

rk

MOLLY
Including that one that you bought
I’ve sold one copy, but there’s a
lot of interest from Hollywood in
buying my life rights. I’ll find a
way to pay you. Charlie, ask around
about me, my word is good.
CHARLIE
Not to the guys you named.

MOLLY
I didn’t have a--just ask around
about me.

in

CHARLIE
(laughing)
Unfortunately the people I’d ask
are goin’ away for a while. What
happened Tuesday morning was called
a GPS Takedown. 31 people were
arrested in the same instant.
Someone you thought was a friend
called you on your phone to make
sure it was the one you were still
using and when you answered that
call, they had you painted and kept
track of your movements until the
agreed upon time.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

34.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Something in excess of 600 agents
were dispatched to locations in New
York and LA in coordinated strikes
with automatic weapons and you’re
trying to tell me you’re in my
office because you raked a game of
Texas Hold ‘Em?!
Yes!

MOLLY

So

CHARLIE
Have you seen the other names on
this indictment? Helly Habib, Mike
Druzhinsky, Mike Anikovich, the
Gershen Brothers? How deep were you
into the Russian mob, Molly?!
‘Cause so far your tell-all doesn’t
say.

MOLLY’s well past tired and Charlie’s quick cross-examination
has either taken something out of her or put something back
in. She stands up and walks to the window...

*
*

*

MOLLY
(pause)
Why are you making your daughter
read The Crucible?

rk

CHARLIE
So she can see what happens when a
group of bored teenage girls
gossip.
MOLLY
I’ve never read the play.

in

CHARLIE
Many consider it to be the best
play of the 20th Century.

MOLLY
Is that what many consider it to
be?

CHARLIE
I don’t defend violent criminals.

MOLLY
I’ve never hurt anyone in my life.
CHARLIE
Your friends have.

MOLLY
I’ve never heard of 90 percent of
the names in the indictment.
CHARLIE
And the other 10 percent?
MOLLY
I didn’t know they were mobsters, I
had no idea who they really were.

So

CHARLIE
(pause)
Let me ask you something. Reardon-in the book--he didn’t say “Poor
people bagels,” did he.
(beat)
I think I know who he is, I think I
know a real estate lawyer who
worked with him and quit. He called
them “nigger bagels,” right?

MOLLY
(pause)
I’m not telling you his name, he’s
not involved in this.

rk

CHARLIE
But you were willing to name the
movie stars.

*

CHARLIE
Were you paid extra in your book
deal to name the movie stars?

*
*
*

MOLLY
(pause)
Yes.

*
*
*

in

MOLLY
None of that matters. Why is the
FBI arresting me two years after--

CHARLIE
I’m not your guy, Molly. I wish you
good luck but this just isn’t for
me.
MOLLY hears that but still doesn’t leave...

MOLLY

Why did you leave the prosecutor’s
office and become a defense
attorney?

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

36.

CHARLIE
My daughter.
MOLLY
You needed to make money.
CHARLIE
That and I was usually one of the
few people who knew where witnesses
were being hidden.
MOLLY
It was dangerous.

So
Mm-hm.

CHARLIE

MOLLY
So you didn’t leave the
prosecutor’s office because you
wanted to stand up for the innocent
and believe everyone’s entitled to
the best defense?

*
*
*

CHARLIE
Not really.

rk

MOLLY
It would have been helpful if you
were Spencer Tracy or--I didn’t
know who the Russians were.
(pause--calmer)
I can get you the two-hundred and
fifty-thousand, I left ten times
that on the street, it’ll just take
some time.

in

CHARLIE
We do pro bono work--we regularly
lend out our best litigators like
me to the ACLU, Southern Poverty
Law Center, veterans groups--but I
don’t think I can convince my
partners to take a flyer on the
Poker Princess.

*
*
*
*
*

*

MOLLY
I didn’t name myself the Poker
Princess.

CHARLIE picks up a copy of Us Weekly that’s been tabbed and
reads-CHARLIE
“Molly Bloom, the self-proclaimed
Poker Princess...”.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

37.

MOLLY
That’s Us Weekly? I agree it would
be unusual for them to print
something that wasn’t true but it’s
not true and if you think a
princess could do what I did you’re
incorrect. I’m getting that you
don’t think much of me but what if
every one of your ill-informed,
unsophisticated opinions about me
were wrong?

*
*

So

CHARLIE
I’d be amazed.

MOLLY
Yeah you know what, bud? You would.
CHARLIE
You don’t need me, you need a
publicist.
MOLLY
No, I need a fuckin’ lawyer!

tries to get up on one ski. She fails and falls hard into the
water.

Her FATHER--the same father we’ve been seeing throughout--and
her MOTHER are on the boat and her FATHER shouts back-FATHER
Again!
The SEVEN-YEAR OLD GIRL is tired but she gets herself ready
to try again. The MOTHER isn’t happy about this but seems
helpless and slightly cowed by the force of the FATHER.

*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
My father’s a therapist and a
psychology professor at Colorado
State. The second rule of his house
was that academic excellence and
athletic excellence weren’t
optional and the first rule was
that he made the rules.

The GIRL is back on her water ski. The boat powers forward
again and the GIRL gets up on one ski for a moment before she
falls. The MOTHER, standing in the back of the boat as a
spotter, raises a flag in the air to let nearby boats know
there’s a skier in the water.

*
*

rk

FATHER
You’re not getting out of the water
till you do this. Again!

MOLLY (V.O.)
I was a skinny kid, and at 7 years
old I didn’t have the core strength
yet to pull this off. In October
the water in Colorado is pretty
cold and we’d been at this since
6AM.

SEVEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL
(calling)

for her daughter but not wanting to start a fight.

Excellent.

A SALESWOMAN comes up to her-SALESWOMAN
Can I pull some styles for you?

MOLLY
I’m looking for a dress that makes
me look nothing like myself.
The SALESWOMAN smiles...

*

SALESWOMAN
Take off your hat, put your hair in
a bun and put on your new shoes.
I’ll pull some options.
INT. BARNEY’S - A FEW MINUTES LATER

So

MOLLY comes out of the dressing room wearing a black dress
that makes her look very sexy...
SALESWOMAN
Well...where did that body come
from?

MOLLY stares at herself in the mirror...

MOLLY (V.O.)
I decided to postpone law school
another year.

rk

INT. VIPER ROOM - NIGHT

*

A game is underway and MOLLY has a whole new look.

*

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d overheard stories about games
that folded after one bad night and
I needed this one to keep going and
I needed to bring value to it. I
knew if I wanted to cement my place
there was one guy I needed to team
up with and that was this man.

We see a HAND LIFTING CARDS, FINGERS PLAYING WITH CHIPS and
then see that they belong to PLAYER X.
MOLLY (V.O.)
The game had regulars and the game
had guests and four of the regulars
were famous actors and I’m going to
call one of them Player X. Player X
subscribed to the belief that money
won was twice as good as money
earned. He lived to beat people and
take their money. Here’s Player X
talking one of the guests into
folding the winning hand.

*

*
*

*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

41.

PLAYER X is in a showdown with the GUEST, who’s sweating
whether to call or fold.
PLAYER X
I swear on my--look at me--I swear
on my mother’s life--I have you.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
Player X was the best player at the
table and tonight this guy was the
worst. He’s staring at his cards-even a reasonably good amateur
would know it was mathematically
the best hand, which in poker is
called the nuts. There was fortyseven thousand dollars in the pot
and the guest was holding the nuts
but he was starting to get confused
because a movie star was talking to
him.
PLAYER X
My mother’s life man, I’m not
messing with you.

The GUEST thinks...surveys the cards...

*

rk

GUEST
(pause)
Why would you be telling me?

in

PLAYER X
Either I am messing with you OR
you’re new to the game, you’ve had
bad cards all night, you should’ve
folded after the flop and I don’t
want to win more of your money this
way. I’ve got queens under here.
Take your time.

The GUEST takes another moment...then tosses in his cards.
GUEST
Fold.

PLAYER X picks up his two losing hole cards--neither a queen-and shows them to the guest-PLAYER X
Fuck you!
The others cheer and pound the table as PLAYER X hauls in his
chips and the guest tries to put on a “just one of the guys
face.”

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

42.

MOLLY (V.O.)
A fish is a particular kind of
player. A fish has money. A fish
plays loose and doesn’t fold a lot.
A fish is good but not too good.
PLAYER X looks over to MOLLY...MOLLY looks back and gives him
a half-smile. Chips get put down as a new hand is dealt.

*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
The Viper Room may have belonged to
Reardon but the game belonged to
Player X. People wanted to say they
played with him the same way they
wanted to say they rode on Air
Force One. My job security was
gonna depend on bringing him his
fish. But where would I find people
with a lot of money who didn’t know
how to spend it and liked to be
around celebrities?

INT. NACIONAL - NIGHT

the CLUB GIRLS who drink shots for a living as the place
pulses around them.

MOLLY
If they say they’re interested in
poker you give them my number. I
vet them. If they end up playing in
the game I’ll give you a thousand
dollars the first time they play
and five-hundred every time after
that.
(handing one of them a slip
of paper)

MOLLY’s standing near a pit boss and watching one of the
players.

*
*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
The Commerce Casino is off the 5
freeway in East LA and no one’s
ever going to confuse it with the
French Riviera. I’d watch the
tables for a while before I
approached a friendly-looking pit
boss.
MOLLY
The third chair at Table 8 can’t
lose.
PIT BOSS
Unless there are players at his
table who can win.
MOLLY
You know about the game at the
Viper Room, right?

*

PIT BOSS

rk

Sure.

MOLLY
It’s a 10K buy-in, blinds are fifty
and a hundred. A thousand for every
player you send me. You get a piece
of what they lose. No pros. I’m

was to win. At what and against

One night a friend asked me to come
with her to a pre-Oscar party being
hosted by the head of one of the
bigger talent agencies. Nothing’ll
remind you that you don’t belong
quite as fast as a party where you
don’t belong. And I must’ve been
invisible because two four-thousand

right next to me.

He’s already agreed to it.

Oh, man, you have to know about the
game. It’s exclusive, you need an
invitation, the winners are coming

dollars and the losers keep coming
back.

So

AGENT #2
Tuesday night at the game.

AGENT #1
Where do they play?

rk

AGENT #2
No one knows where. Nobody who
plays talks about it and everybody
wants in. But my point is that Rich
played with him and he’s agreeing
to the number.
MOLLY (V.O.)
And just like that, I was about to
belong.

in

AGENT #1
I need to get a seat at this game.

MOLLY downs what’s left of her champagne and steps to the two
agents-MOLLY
Excuse me, I couldn’t help
overhearing you.

INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

CHARLIE is standing and waiting as MOLLY and the bodyguards
come in and walk through a metal detector. They all make
their way down the hall--

in

CHARLIE
Here’s all that’s gonna happen
today. The judge is gonna ask each
defendant if they’ve read the
indictment or if they’d like the
court to read it to them. Then the
judge is going to ask you how you
plead and you’ll answer, “Not
Guilty.” I’ll make it clear for the
record that I’m not your counsel
but that I’m appearing on your
behalf at the arraignment. In
propria persona.
MOLLY
“In propria persona” means on your
behalf.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

Yeah.

49.

CHARLIE

MOLLY
No, I’m saying it means on your
behalf.
CHARLIE
I am appearing on your behalf.

So

MOLLY
“In propria persona” means that
you’re appearing on your behalf,
not my behalf.

CHARLIE
(beat)
I’ll check that out but the point
is I’m not your lawyer and I’ll
make that clear for the record.

He stops her before they walk into the courtroom and shows a
little compassion...

rk

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Look...my office’ll give you a list
of names when we’re done. There are
plenty of firms that’ll just be
happy for the exposure. You’ll be
fine.
MOLLY
I appreciate it.

*

CHARLIE
(pause)
Alright. It’s a scary room. Don’t
be scared.

in

MOLLY
Charlie, I know what’s what, okay?

CHARLIE opens the courtroom door and holds it for MOLLY and
the TWO BODYGUARDS as they walk into-INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

The courtroom is huge and ornate and right now it’s a bit of
a spectacle.
On the right side of the gallery are the defendants and their
lawyers--about 60 people in all. Behind a plexiglass
partition are some more defendants in prison coveralls and
shackles. The defendants range in age from early-20’s to late
80’s.

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

50.

On the left side of the gallery are the wives and girlfriends
of the defendants. They’re all beautifully dressed and
manicured and have on some of their gaudiest jewelry for the
occasion.
Seated in back of them are the press and it was a tough
ticket to get.
At the prosecutor’s table are three Assistant U.S. Attorneys,
including HARRISON WELLSTONE, the lead attorney on the case
who we’ll get to know later.

So

JUDGE DUSTIN FOXMAN is already seated at the bench and is
quietly going over some business with the prosecutors as the
packed courtroom hums with quiet chatter.
CHARLIE points a bodyguard to where he wants Molly to sit-four taped off seats on the right side toward the back. As
MOLLY and the BODYGUARDS take their seats, CHARLIE stands in
the aisle a moment and looks at HARRISON, the lead
prosecutor. HARRISON turns back from the bench and heads to
his table and sees Charlie. HARRISON half-smiles and gives
CHARLIE a small wave. CHARLIE gives him a small wave back and
takes his seat on the aisle next to one of the bodyguards.

*

MOLLY’s clocked all that.

*

rk

CHARLIE
(quietly to MOLLY)
You got a good judge, he’s a good
guy.

*
*
*
*
*

*

MOLLY
How ‘bout the prosecutor?

*

JUDGE FOXMAN raps his gavel once, the room quiets down, and
everyone takes their seats.

*

in

CHARLIE takes a moment and then shakes his head “no”.

JUDGE FOXMAN
Counsel, please state your
appearances for the record?

HARRISON
Good morning, Your Honor, Harrison
Wellstone and Jack Brennan on
behalf of the Government, joined at
counsel table by FBI Agent Deborah

One of the defense lawyers stands up-MR. SERNOVITZ
Your Honor-The seemingly routine business of the hearing continues under
the following-CHARLIE
(quietly to the bodyguard)
Switch with me a second.

So

CHARLIE and the BODYGUARD switch places so that Charlie’s
sitting next to Molly now.

*

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Do you know what a “Vor v Zakone”
is? A “Vor”?
MOLLY

No.

rk

CHARLIE
The literal translation is “thiefin-law.” It’s the Russian
equivalent of a Don or a Godfather.
Nikolai Illyanovich is a Vor. He’s
the one who tried to fix the Salt
Lake City Olympics.
MOLLY
I wasn’t there.

in

CHARLIE
He’s also had a lot of people
killed. It’s basically do what I’m
telling you or we’ll kill your
kids.

MOLLY
I’ve never had an audience with the
Vor, I’m not a made man and I don’t
know who Nikolai Illyanovich is.
CHARLIE
(pointing to a man behind
the plexiglass)
He’s standing right there. I can
introduce you guys, you’re codefendants.
(to the BODYGUARD)
Switch back.

SIEGEL
Good morning, Your Honor. David

lawyer?
I have.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

53.

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Just in case your lawyer doesn’t
mention it, the next time you
appear in front of the judge you
should re-think your clothes. You
look like the Cinemax version of
yourself.

So

MOLLY
I sold my clothes after the
government seized all my money two
years ago which incidentally was
the last time I ran a poker game
but I think I mentioned that
already.

CHARLIE
(beat)
Okay.

Your old boss--the one you call
Reardon--he was kind of a jerk to
you. Why would you cover for him by
changing it to “poor people
bagels”?

you’re asking, no. In fact there’s
nothing you could be asking where
it wouldn’t be no. A fifty-two card
deck produces hundreds of millions
of random patterns but every time
one of you loses two weeks in a row
you’re sure something fishy must be
up.
REARDON
I’m gonna stop paying you.

MOLLY
What do you mean?

REARDON
As my assistant.
MOLLY
You’re firing me?

in

REARDON
I’m not firing you, I’m just gonna
stop paying you. You get paid once
a week from the game, it doesn’t
seem fair.
MOLLY
But I also have a job working for
you 24 hours a day.

REARDON
And if you didn’t have that job you
wouldn’t have the game, you
understand what I’m saying?
MOLLY
(pause)
I understand each of the words that
you’re saying, but--

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

62.

REARDON
Look-MOLLY
24 hours a day every day. You’re
gonna stop paying me to do that job
because I’m making too much money
doing my second job and if I say no
I’ll lose both jobs. Because it
doesn’t seem fair?

So

REARDON
Business is bad right now, welcome
to the real world.

MOLLY takes a moment and then goes for it--

rk

MOLLY
Alright, here it is: Banks are
loaning you money and they
shouldn’t. You’re a bad risk, they
know that. So the debt service on
your loans is close to 20 percent
which is crazy. 20 percent is
barely survivable if it’s a bridge
loan but, for instance, it’s taken
you 10 years to build seven houses,
all of which are worth less than
they were before you built them
because the housing market’s on a
downward trajectory for the first
time in the history of houses and
that’s why business is bad, not
because you pay me four-hundred and
fifty dollars a week.
REARDON
You’re a business savant?

in

MOLLY
I’ve read every piece of paper in
your office.
REARDON
You’re making thousands in tips
every week, why do you care about
(four-hundred and fifty dollars a
week?)
MOLLY
(over)
I care about it because I don’t
want to pick up your dry cleaning
for free.

REARDON
You don’t have bargaining power
here. You can refuse the pay cut
but you’ll lose the game.

Cash me out please.
REARDON heads back inside and Molly stands there alone a
moment...

INT. LUXURY SUITE - A BIT LATER
The game is in full swing and high spirits. MOLLY and her
laptop are observing from a little distance.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
The game was mine now. I
incorporated and MDB Event Planning
was born. I paid taxes and 1099’d
my employees. I never became
romantically or sexually involved
with any of the players. It just
wouldn’t have been professional-this was back when I was still
making good decisions. And I went
to a lawyer to make absolutely sure
all this was legal.

BUTTERMAN
You’re running a square game.

INT. LUXURY SUITE - NIGHT

A game is underway and it looks like everything Molly’s
describing.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
My game had a tricky ecosystem. It
was built around escapism and
exclusivity. These guys could buy
their way into anything and anyone
but here in this room you couldn’t
buy your win. You couldn’t buy me,
you couldn’t buy the girls and you
couldn’t buy a seat at the table.
There’s nothing as sweet as a win
you have to work for and the wins
and losses were compelling and they
were real. Of course it helped that
the players were gambling addicts.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

INT. LUXURY SUITE - LATER
The game has ended. Diego’s breaking down the table, the
women are cleaning up and PLAYER X is talking to MOLLY.

PLAYER X
I’ve had a thought.
Yeah?

MOLLY

PLAYER X
Raise the stakes.

So
MOLLY
(pause)
To what?

PLAYER X
50K buy-in. Blinds are five-hundred
and a thousand.

MOLLY
(pause)
That’s uh...that’s a 500 percent
hike.
PLAYER X

rk

Yeah.

MOLLY
I don’t think it’s a good idea.
PLAYER X
(calling out)
Could you give me the room a
second?

They wait for the women to leave the room...

in

MOLLY
The players who are losing a
hundred-thousand a week are gonna
be losing half a million.

PLAYER X
And the players winning a hundredthousand--

MOLLY
--will have no one left to play
with. Players are gonna get hurt,
others are gonna get killed and
some of them are gonna drop out.
It’s not sustainable and we’ll lose
the game.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

PLAYER X
Find new players.
MOLLY (V.O.)
He meant find new fish and with
these stakes that was gonna be
challenging. First up was Donnie
Silverman.

MOLLY (V.O.)
Donnie won the World Series of

makes a note on a pad and then continues watching.

CUT TO:

MOLLY (V.O.)
Ordinarily if you were at the final
table at the World Series that
would automatically disqualify you
from playing in my game but a Vegas
contact told me to look at the
film. So that night I watched seven
hours of the world’s worst
spectator sport.

Silverman won the World Series of
Poker.

MOLLY
He took eleven hands at the final
table. He had the nuts on eight of
them and three of those--three-were two-outers with four players
still in the hand. He ran hot. He
doesn’t lock his chips down, he’s
reckless, gives tons of action and
just won 12-million dollars.

MOLLY (V.O.)
Next up was Harlan Eustis.

So

MOLLY’s watching HARLAN play at one of the tables. He’s got a
big stack of chips in front of him.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
Player X said he met him at the
Commerce Casino and that he’d be
good for the game but I wasn’t
seeing what he was seeing. He
played tight, folding after the
hole cards 64 percent of the time.

HARLAN tosses his cards into the middle of the table.

QUICK CUT TO:

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
It wasn’t clear where his money
came from. He produced backyard

EXT. BEAUTIFUL MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - EVENING

*

Two men in their 30’s, BRAD and NEAL, are walking on the
beach toward the house and we move in on BRAD--

*
*

MOLLY (V.O.)
The third new recruit was Brad
Marion, who everyone called Bad
Brad because he was uniquely
terrible at this game. If there was
a worse player in the world, Brad
would still find a way to lose to
him.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

So

As BRAD and NEAL get closer to the house we can see bikiniclad women and a few guys partying around the hot tub.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d been asked to throw together a
game on a Saturday night at the
Malibu house of a man who made his
money by co-starring in a sex video
opposite a woman who made her money
by being born with it.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

A game is underway. BRAD waits in the doorway and watches the
game as NEAL approaches MOLLY.

*
*

rk

INT. MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - EVENING

Hey.

NEAL

*
*
*
*

NEAL
I’m three houses down. Derrick said
you were having a game and I wanted
to--

*
*
*
*

in

MOLLY
Hey, what are you doing here?

MOLLY puts her finger up to say, “Just a second.” She watches
the end of the hand play out.

*
*

MOLLY
(back to Neal)
Yeah.

*
*
*

NEAL
I just wanted to introduce you to
Brad Marion, he wants to play.

*
*
*

MOLLY
Well if you give me his information
I’ll check him out.

*
*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

74.

NEAL
No, Derrick’s gonna vouch for him.
MOLLY looks at BRAD, a sweet if slightly odd guy with a
slight facial tic. He’s looking at the game like a kid in a
candy store. Then she steps over to one of the players-DERRICK--and whispers in his ear.
MOLLY (V.O.)
“Derrick’s gonna vouch for him”
meant Derrick would cover any
losses if Brad didn’t pay. Up to
any amount.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

So

DERRICK nods his head “yes” without taking his eyes off the
table.

*
*

MOLLY looks at BRAD again, then waves him over.

*

INT. LUXURY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

*

A game is underway and BRAD’s playing now.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
But he could pay, and did.

rk

As we go through a SERIES OF CUTS showing BRAD betting huge
stacks of chips, losing, buying in from MOLLY for another
50K, betting huge, losing, etc.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

BRAD loses another hand and walks over to Molly’s table.

*

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
Bad Brad had raised 45-million
dollars for a fund that traded oil
futures and every week he came to
the game, lost a quarter of a
million dollars and tipped me 10thousand so he could play the next
week. He wasn’t getting any better
and the guys were feasting on him.

BRAD
Can I get another fifty?

*
*

MOLLY
Hey, let’s talk for a second.

*
*

Sure.

BRAD

*
*

MOLLY
Brad, this game may not be for you.

*
*

BRAD
I know I’m no card shark.

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

75.

MOLLY
No, you’re not.

*
*

MOLLY shows BRAD her computer screen--

*

MOLLY (CONT’D)
These are your losses after ten
weeks. And you’ve won...never. The
strongest players have losing weeks
and the weaker players get lucky
but I’ve never seen someone not
win, you know, ever. It’s actually
a statistical anomaly.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

So

BRAD
Yeah I know. I like playing with
the guys. I don’t have that many
friends. Don’t take my seat away, I
can tip you more.

*
*
*
*
*

MOLLY
No, your tips are very generous.
How about if I got you some books
to read? Or even a pro to give you
lessons?

*
*
*
*
*

BRAD
Sure. Maybe. Let me think about it.

*
*

rk

MOLLY
(pause)
Okay. Sign for fifty-thousand.

*
*
*

MOLLY pulls chips while BRAD signs on a clipboard.

*

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
Turned out Bad Brad knew what he
was doing. He was getting
customers. He’d drop 200K at the
game and pick up two-million for
his hedge fund.
DERRICK slaps BRAD on the back--

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

DERRICK
Tell ‘em what’s smart this week.

*
*

MOLLY (V.O.)
More on that later as well but
first the final recruit.

EXT. DODGER STADIUM/OWNER’S LUXURY BOX - NIGHT

MOLLY and some other nicely-dressed people are watching the
game in style but at this moment they’re standing in nervous
anticipation. Some of the people are holding hands for luck
and a couple are covering their eyes.

*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I was in the owner’s box at Dodger
Stadium when People Magazine’s
Sexiest Man Alive called me. I was
dating the owners’ son at the time
and the night before we’d had a
discussion about priorities.

for millionaire movie stars, being
the only woman in the room--

*

MOLLY
I’m sorry, I didn’t realize until
just now that you’re mad.

*
*
*

BOYFRIEND
When you’re not running a game
you’re out recruiting, you sleep-when you sleep--you have two phones
clutched to your chest, you went
out in the middle of the night last
night, I don’t even know where--

*
*

in

MOLLY
You shouldn’t have, that’s why I
have a key.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

77.

MOLLY
It was to pick up a check from a
player. I got a call.
BOYFRIEND
You couldn’t pick up the check in
the morning?
MOLLY
You can’t let a gambler sleep on a
debt.

So

BOYFRIEND
I don’t think this argument’s gonna
get me anywhere.
MOLLY
You want to have sex like we’re
strangers?
BOYFRIEND
I want to make this work!

*
*

MOLLY (V.O.)
I over-promised.

rk

MOLLY
Okay. Okay. I do too. And tomorrow
night I’m gonna come with you to
the game and I’m not gonna make any
calls or take any calls and I’m
gonna make a good impression on
your parents. I’m gonna be there
just for you.

EXT. DODGER STADIUM/OWNER’S LUXURY BOX - NIGHT

in

Back with MOLLY, her BOYFRIEND, the PARENTS and other guests,
some of whom are praying or covering their eyes, etc.
MOLLY (V.O.)
‘Cause the thing is if you’re
sitting in the owner’s box with the
owners, who are also your
boyfriend’s parents--

We see hits of the scoreboard that demonstrate what Molly’s
talking about.

*
*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

78.

MOLLY (V.O.)
--and your team is batting in the
bottom of the ninth, down by a run,
one out, runners on first and third
and a win means you’re in the
playoffs, you’re really not at that
moment supposed to take a phone
call.

*
*

MOLLY’s phone buzzes and she sneaks a peak at the caller ID.
The BOYFRIEND clocks this.

rk

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I wanted this man in the game, and
not because he was People’s Sexiest
Man Alive. I already had three of
them at the table. But this one was
a heavyweight--one of the biggest
stars in the world. A 9-time Grammy
winner whose last two albums
debuted at Number-1 on the
Billboard chart. Smart,
charismatic, and influential, he
wasn’t a recluse but you didn’t see
him at parties or clubs. He was
powerful fish bait, he was whale
bait, he was an actual rock star
and he was good business. And if I
had him as an ally I wouldn’t be
dependant on Player X.

MOLLY makes her decision, takes out her phone, tells her
BOYFRIEND she’s sorry and she’ll be just a second and gets
the reaction you’d expect.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

Yes.

And...?

MOLLY

CHARLIE
MOLLY

rk

I passed.

CHARLIE

CHARLIE
You passed on seven offers.
MOLLY
You will be paid, Charlie.

CHARLIE
No, I’m just curious why you passed
on seven offers.

in

MOLLY
Creative differences. Should we
start?
CHARLIE
Okay, you see this?

CHARLIE’s motioned to a stack of documents--

*

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
This is discovery. Let’s see what
we’ve discovered.

CHARLIE will draw a crude diagram on a white board as he
speaks.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

82.

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Over here we have Michael
Druzhinsky, Michael Anikovich and
Michael Slobo. The three Mikes.
CHARLIE draws three “M”s and puts a circle around it.

So

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
The three Mikes run a chain of
corrupt medical clinics and they’ve
been committing insurance fraud,
wire fraud and mail fraud on an
epic scale. Over here is the
Taiwanchik-Gershen Organization.

CHARLIE writes “TGO” and draws a circle around it.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
They’re a worldwide bookmaking
operation handling hundreds of
millions of dollars a year in
illegal sports betting. And over
here is the Habib-Gershen
Organization.

CHARLIE writes “HGO” and draws a circle around it. The three
organizations are now in a triangle on the white board.

rk

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Also an illegal bookmaking
operation but this one financed by
an art gallery owned by Hillel
Habib who everyone calls--

Helly.

*

*
*

*
*
*

*

MOLLY

MOLLY and CHARLIE both understand that MOLLY just admitted to
knowing these guys.

*

in

CHARLIE
(pause)
This is the Russian mafia. And the
three are tied together in the
indictment through...? A poker
game.

CHARLIE writes “Molly” in the middle of the triangle and
draws a circle around it.
MOLLY
Were they tapping my phone?
No.

CHARLIE

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

Thank God.

83.

MOLLY

CHARLIE
They were tapping the phones of
everyone you talked to.
Okay.

MOLLY

So

CHARLIE
Druzhinsky’s phone was tapped.
They’ve got you confirming that you
ran raked games at various
locations in New York and they’ve
also got a confidential informant
confirming that you ran raked games
at various locations in New York.
You were in violation of 1955-that’s the part of the U.S. Code
that makes it illegal to run an
illegal gambling business.
(pause)
You know what you did? You finished
writing your book before the good
part happened.

rk

MOLLY
You get a kick outta yourself,
don’t you.

CHARLIE lifts up a copy of Molly’s Game-CHARLIE
I don’t like this picture.
Thank you.

MOLLY

in

CHARLIE
You look like the cat who ate the
canary and then told the canary’s
parents about it.

MOLLY
I don’t like it either but it’s the
picture the publisher wanted and I
wasn’t given a vote.
CHARLIE
I liked the book though. A good
story well told.
Thank you.

MOLLY

*
*

84.
CHARLIE
I need you to tell it again. From
the beginning and this time without
leaving anything out. Would you
like a glass of water?
MOLLY
I’d like a glass of bourbon.
CHARLIE
And one more thing.
MOLLY

So

Yeah.

CHARLIE
I need your hard drives.
MOLLY
Going back how far?
CHARLIE
What do you mean?

MOLLY
I kept my hard drives when I’d buy
a new laptop.

rk

CHARLIE
You’re kidding.

MOLLY
It had records of who owed what and
spreadsheets on the players.

MOLLY
(pause)
Are you joking?

in

CHARLIE
They have more than that. Every
time you charge your phone by
plugging it into your computer the
computer records all your text
messages and e-mails.

CHARLIE
I want to run a forensic imaging of
your hard drives.
MOLLY
No, I’ll be destroying those hard
drives.

85.
CHARLIE
You can’t, they’re evidence.
MOLLY
I’m going to blow them up. I’m
literally going to use explosives
and then scatter the remains in the
Colorado River.
CHARLIE
You already told me they exist.

So

MOLLY
You’re just gonna have to pretend I
didn’t tell you.
CHARLIE
I can’t do that.

MOLLY
I don’t have any hard drives, I
work with an abacus.
Molly--

CHARLIE

MOLLY
There are no hard drives!

rk

CHARLIE
If you destroy evidence and
obstruct justice on top of the
charges already brought against you
in this case, you will, I promise
you, be incarcerated.
MOLLY
You don’t understand what’s in
those text messages.

in

CHARLIE
I understand that you’ve had
boyfriends and that there are gonna
be private exchanges.

MOLLY
You don’t understand. There are
going to be those messages and
they’ll be embarrassing but there
are also going to be messages that
would destroy lives. Other lives.
There are messages that would end
careers and obliterate families. If
the text messages were made public-CHARLIE
They won’t be.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

86.

MOLLY
If they were-CHARLIE
They won’t be.
MOLLY
--it would be catastrophic for many
people.
CHARLIE
I’m a lawyer. I’m legally-MOLLY

So
No.

CHARLIE
Listen to me, I’m legally
prohibited from disclosing-MOLLY
My last lawyer sold my deposition
to the National Enquirer, Charlie!
(beat)
That happened. But the information
in that deposition will be nothing
compared to the consequences of
those text messages--

rk

Hang on.

CHARLIE

CHARLIE walks to his desk and picks up his copy of Molly’s
Game.
MOLLY
Children will find out their
fathers--

in

CHARLIE
The movie stars you named in the
book--you’d already named them
under oath in the Bad Brad Marion
deposition.

MOLLY
It was that or perjure myself and
Brad had already named everyone in
the game.

CHARLIE
That’s not what I’m getting at.
Your lawyer back then--Butterball-Butterman.

*

MOLLY

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

87.

CHARLIE
Butterman leaked your deposition to
the tabloids?
Yeah.

MOLLY

CHARLIE nods that now he understands...
What.

MOLLY (CONT’D)

So

CHARLIE
That’s why those were the only real
names you used in the book, the
ones that were given up by
Butterbean.
Yeah.

MOLLY

CHARLIE
And is that why you have creative
differences with the Hollywood
offers? They want information you
won’t give them?

rk

MOLLY
None of this has anything to do
with the Russian mob, right?

CHARLIE
What’s on the hard drives, Molly?
Famous married guys hitting on you?
MOLLY nods her head “yeah”.

CHARLIE picks up his cell phone and tosses it to her.

in

MOLLY
What’s this?

CHARLIE
It’s got every e-mail and text
message I’ve sent in the last year
as well as a variety of
incriminating evidence about my
clients. If anything of yours leaks
you can sell my phone to the
highest bidder and I’ll lose my job
and be disbarred.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

88.

MOLLY
In order to demonstrate the
sanctity of your attorney/client
confidentiality you’re betraying
the confidentiality of all your
other clients?
CHARLIE
I know you’re not gonna read it. If
you’re having a hard time trusting
me, maybe it’ll help to know I
trust you.

So

MOLLY takes a long moment before she says--

*

MOLLY
I’ll fly home to Colorado and be
back the next day with the hard
drives.

MOLLY tosses Charlie’s phone back to him.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Here’s how I lost the LA game.

*
*
*

INT. LUXURY SUITE - NIGHT

*

HARLAN EUSTICE stares silently at cards we can’t see. Then he
explodes--

*

rk

CUT TO:

HARLAN
Motherfucker!

in

HARLAN’s frozen in furious silence for a moment. The other
players are quiet and don’t look at him. HARLAN grabs some
food that’s on a plate and throws it at DIEGO--

*
*
*

HARLAN (CONT’D)
Fuck you!

DIEGO is professional and doesn’t react.

*

HARLAN (CONT’D)
Fuck you, you Mexican fuck!

HARLAN doesn’t get far in his tirade before MOLLY quickly
steps in and defuses the situation.
HARLAN (CONT’D)
You undocumented fucking border
jumping fuck!

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

89.

MOLLY
Hey HEY!
(to Harlan)
You get out on the terrace.
*

MOLLY
(to HARLAN)
Out on the terrace. Now.

*

So

HARLAN
(to DIEGO)
You’ve been pullin’ that shit all
night!

MOLLY motions to CASSIE, the relief dealer, the way a
baseball manager would motion to the bullpen. MOLLY walks
DIEGO away from the table--

*
*
*

MOLLY (CONT’D)
(quietly)
You good?
DIEGO

Yeah.

MOLLY
Have a drink.

rk

MOLLY goes out on to--

*

EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS
--where HARLAN’s waiting.

*

MOLLY
What the hell.

in

HARLAN
I’ll apologize to Diego.

MOLLY
Yeah and you’re gonna go home, I’m
making a floor call, that’s it.

HARLAN doesn’t say anything--he just stares out at Los
Angeles...
MOLLY (CONT’D)
(pause)
Did you hear me?
HARLAN
I don’t have it.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

90.

MOLLY
(beat)
You don’t have what?
HARLAN looks at MOLLY very simply...

*

HARLAN
The million-two, I don’t have it.
MOLLY takes that in...

*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
It was 5am on Saturday. This game
began at 7pm on Thursday.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Everyone’s much fresher and more energetic. DIEGO’s dealing.

*

HARLAN
I rented out the whole courtyard of
the Buffalo Club, it’ll be about a
hundred people. Kumamoto oysters,
snow crab, lobsters--

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
Harlan Eustice was the producer of
backyard wrestling videos who
Player X badly wanted in the game.
Harlan was excited about the
surprise 40th birthday party he was
throwing for his wife in 24 hours.
HARLAN
Kobe beef, black truffle pasta,
Dover sole--

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I liked Harlan. There was no
affectation, no Hollywooding, no
flossing--he wasn’t ticking off the
menu items to show off, he was
genuinely excited about the party
he was giving his wife.
HARLAN
She doesn’t know anything, she
thinks we’re having dinner with her
brother and his wife.
MOLLY (V.O.)
But nobody else liked him except
Player X.

(MORE)

*
*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

91.

MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He played tight, didn’t give a lot
of action and always got his money
in good which means he was running
the odds. In other words he was
playing poker and the others were
gambling.
In a SERIES OF SHOTS we see HARLAN folding hands-HARLAN
(tossing in his cards)
Fold.

So

LATER--

Fold.

HARLAN (CONT’D)

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

LATER--

*

HARLAN tosses in his cards--

*

LATER--

*

HARLAN (CONT’D)
(tossing his cards)
Nope.

rk

LATER--

HARLAN hauls in a huge pile of chips after a win.
MOLLY (V.O.)
And he won.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

CASSIE’s dealing in the middle of a hand. There’s already a
small pot in the middle and the only two players left are
HARLAN and BRAD. The four cards turned over in the middle are
queen-eight-nine-nine.

*

in

INT. LUXURY SUITE - LATER

MOLLY (V.O.)
By midnight Harlan had tripled his
original fifty-thousand dollar buyin but everything came off the
rails with one hand. And that’s how
it happens, that’s how you go full
tilt. Harlan, the best player at
the table, the best player at most
tables, was about to get bluffed
off the nuts by, of all people, Bad
Brad.
CASSIE turns over a fifth card--a king.

*

*
*
*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

92.

MOLLY (V.O.)
How? Because this was only Brad’s
second game, Harlan hadn’t been at
his first, and Harlan didn’t know
yet that Brad was bad.
Animation shows Harlan’s hand--an 8 and a 9--which when added
to the table cards (KQ899) gives Harlan a full house.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Harlan’s got a boat, nine’s full.

So

Animation shows Brad with a 3 and a 5, which when added to
the table cards equals nothing.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Brad’s got nothing but his pre-flop
betting made it look, entirely
accidentally, like there was a
chance he had pocket kings, which,
if true, would give him the better
full house.

HARLAN counts his chips and pushes some into the pot--

*

HARLAN
30-thousand.

rk

BRAD begins counting his chips.

*

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
And there it is. Brad’s counting
off 30-thousand which means he’s
gonna call and Harlan knows that if
Brad’s gonna call and not raise it
means he didn’t have the boat and
he’s betting a high two-pair-probably kings and queens. But then
instead of calling the bet-BRAD pushes ALL his chips in-BRAD
I’m all in.

MOLLY (V.O.)
--Brad pushes 72-thousand dollars
into the pot. Harlan looks at Brad.
Every tell Harlan knows about-carotid artery pumping, stiff hands-Brad’s doing the opposite.
Harlan’s betting had represented a
huge hand by calling on the flop,
check-raising the turn and bombing
the river.

(MORE)

*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

93.

MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Of course Harlan didn’t know that
Brad didn’t know what any of that
meant. So Harlan, always a good
sport, said-HARLAN
Nice bet. I’m laying this down.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
--as he tossed in what he didn’t
realize was the winning hand. Brad
tosses in his cards too and one of
them flips over and Harlan sees
it’s not a king.
BRAD
Oh, sorry about that.

HARLAN puts his finger on the flipped card to keep the dealer
from collecting it.

*

HARLAN
You didn’t have pocket kings?
BRAD
I didn’t have any kings. Except the
one in the middle.

rk

HARLAN
You had two pair?

BRAD
I had one pair, the nines in the
middle.

Everyone starts laughing raucously at Harlan--asking “How
could you fold that?!”, “Bill Buckner!”--further humiliating
Harlan and patting Brad on the back. HARLAN is frozen. Whitefaced. MOLLY of course is clocking all this.

*
*
*

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
It wasn’t even that it was that
much money--Harlan only lost about
40-thousand on the hand--

HARLAN gets up and starts pacing around the room.
MOLLY (V.O.)
--but a circuit breaker blew and
Harlan was out for blood.
Everyone’s.
HARLAN walks up to MOLLY--

*
*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

94.

MOLLY
(quietly)
You’ve got 51-thousand on the
table, you want another 50?
HARLAN
Gimme another hundred.
MOLLY
(beat)
Sign here for 100-thousand.
MOLLY starts to pull the chips and we --

*

So
CUT TO:

INT. LUXURY SUITE - LATER

HARLAN watches while another pair of hands haul in the pot.
He gets up and goes to MOLLY.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
By 5am Harlan was down half a
million. He’d abandoned everything
he knew about poker and was playing
like a frat kid--swinging for a
home run on every hand.

rk

HARLAN
Another hundred.
Harlan--

MOLLY

HARLAN
Molly. Please. Let’s go.

*
*

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LATER

in

MOLLY
Sign here for a hundred.

The staff closes the curtains to shut out the daylight. TWO
NEW PLAYERS walk in, freshly dressed for work.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Text messages were going out
letting everyone know Harlan was
bleeding. Guys were coming by to
play for a couple of hours before
work. They’d been losing to him for
months. Everyone wanted a check
from Harlan Eustice.

*
*

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

95.

HARLAN’s pouring himself a Red Bull and vodka as Molly walks
up to him.

*

MOLLY
If you go home now you can get a
few hours sleep before Sheila’s
party.
Soon.

HARLAN

So

MOLLY
You’re on tilt--everybody knows it.
And you’re playing without the
ammunition you need to win.

*

HARLAN
You’re right.

MOLLY
(beat)
Alright, thank you.

*

HARLAN
Give me 500-thousand.

MOLLY looks at him...

*

rk

HARLAN (CONT’D)
I’m just gonna get back to even.

MOLLY looks at him and then pulls $500,000 in chips and
counts them for Harlan.

*

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
That should be the second line of
every gambler’s obit. “Mr.
Feldstein died while trying to get
back to even.” Harlan never did.
And he never got to his wife’s
birthday party. She filed for
divorce two days later but there
was one last punch coming that
would put Harlan on the floor for
good.
INT. LUXURY HOTEL SUITE - LATER

The staff opens the curtains and it’s dark outside again. A
room service cart is being pushed into the hall by one of the
female staff.
HARLAN and another player in his 30’s are the only two in the
hand but everyone’s watching with great interest.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

96.

MOLLY (V.O.)
Harlan was heads-up against a guy
named Frederick who was Austrian
royalty--the son of a Count in the
House of Habsburg and a distant
cousin of Marie Antoinette.
Again, we see animation on the screen as MOLLY describes
their hands.

*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
Harlan had pocket queens. His
Excellency had Ace-King. They were
both in 65K pre-flop.

DIEGO burns a card and then deals three in the middle.
MOLLY (V.O.)
The flop’s queen-seven-seven.
Harlan has a full-house again,
queens full of sevens--with three
rounds of betting in front of him.
The Count has nothing.

FREDERICK stacks his chips and pushes them all in.

in

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
And the Count goes all in. He wants
Harlan to think he’s got two more
sevens under there. Bite me, says
Harlan, he’s not falling for this
again and he snap calls all in.
There’s $750,000 on the table.
Diego burns a card and deals the
turn. A king. Otto von Bismarck now
has two pair, kings and sevens, but
two-pair’s nothing next to a full
house. And at this point, the only
hand left that can beat a queen
full house--

DIEGO turns over the fifth card. It’s a king--

*

*
*
*
*

*
*
*

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
--is a king full house. Captain von
Trapp bluffed two pair and rivered
into kings full!
Then all of a sudden-HARLAN
Motherfucker!

We’re back at the scene we saw before. HARLAN’s frozen in
furious silence for a moment.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

97.

The other players are quiet and don’t look at him. Harlan
grabs some food that’s on a plate and throws it at Diego-Fuck you!

HARLAN (CONT’D)

DIEGO is professional and doesn’t react.

*

HARLAN (CONT’D)
Fuck you, you Mexican fuck!
HARLAN doesn’t get far into his tirade before MOLLY quickly
steps in and defuses the situation.

*

So

HARLAN (CONT’D)
You undocumented fucking border
jumping fuck!

MOLLY
Hey HEY!
(to HARLAN)
You get out on the terrace.

HARLAN
(to Diego)
You’ve been pullin’ that shit all
night!

MOLLY
(to Harlan)
Out on the terrace.

MOLLY motions to CASSIE, the relief dealer, the way a
baseball manager would motion to the bullpen. MOLLY walks
DIEGO away from the table--

*
*
*

MOLLY (CONT’D)
(quietly)
You good?
DIEGO

MOLLY

MOLLY goes out on to-EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS

MOLLY
We’ll meet tomorrow and talk about
what to do.

And what you’ve gotta do is tell
Sheila the truth, okay, you tell
her the truth. Tell her what
happened. And I’m gonna help you,
I’m gonna get you to a meeting.
We’ll talk tomorrow and figure out
what to do about the money.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Harlan and I didn’t meet the next
day. He just called me and said
everything was okay and showed up
the next week with a check.

EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - DAY
MOLLY’s standing in front of her car, a Mercedes convertible,
in the middle of a slightly heated exchange with PLAYER X.

*
*

MOLLY
Where did he get the money from?
PLAYER X
I loaned it to him.
Loaned it?

MOLLY

So

PLAYER X
I get 50% of his wins until the
debt’s paid off and then 50% for
the next two years with no
exposure.
MOLLY
You’re taking 50% of his wins and
no exposure on the losses.
Yeah.

PLAYER X

rk

MOLLY
First of all he’ll never climb out
of that, that’s sharecropper math.
Second, you can’t stake a player
and play in the game at the same
time.

PLAYER X
I’ve been doing it for three years.

*

MOLLY’s stunned...

Yeah.

in

MOLLY
(pause)
You’ve been staking Harlan?
PLAYER X

MOLLY
(beat)
Jesus Christ--

PLAYER X
It’s not cheating.
MOLLY
It is a hundred percent cheating.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

100.

PLAYER X
Tell me how it’s cheating.
MOLLY
Are you kidding?
PLAYER X
Tell me how it’s cheating.
MOLLY
If you have an interest in another
player winning?

So

PLAYER X
You think I’m gonna take a dive?
And if I did, who would care?
MOLLY
You fold your hole cards--a five of
clubs and a jack of hearts--he’s
still in the game. It would benefit
him to know that the five of hearts
and jack of spades are no longer in
play, don’t you think?
PLAYER X
You think I’m signaling him?

rk

MOLLY
I’m saying it can’t fuckin’ happen
again.
PLAYER X
(pause)
You know who the biggest winner in
this game is?
MOLLY

in

You.

PLAYER X
You know who the second biggest
winner is?
MOLLY
Look--

PLAYER X
You.

MOLLY
We’ve had this conversation a
couple of times before.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

101.

PLAYER X
Maybe it’s time to have it again.
‘Cause between you, the dealers and
the girls you’re taking a lot of
money out of the game.
MOLLY
You made more money playing poker
this year than you did making
movies.

So

PLAYER X
I think we should talk again about
capping your tips.

MOLLY
You want to get together with the
other players--who on my tax
returns are called clients--and
discuss putting a ceiling on my
wages.

*

PLAYER X
That’s right.

MOLLY
It’ll be America’s most closelywatched anti-trust case.

rk

PLAYER X
Are you threatening me?

*
*

MOLLY
That’s movie dialogue and you were
threatening me. Here’s your check.
I’ll see you Tuesday.

driver’s side to say one last thing...

INT. LUXURY SUITE - NIGHT
A game is underway and we see the hands of PLAYER X. We move
down the table and see ANOTHER PAIR OF HANDS. They belong to
PLAYER Y.

*
*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
I always found Player Y to be a
nice guy. Polite, a good loser, a
good winner, and unflappable in the
face of boorishness.
DERRICK
Tell us who you’re fucking besides
your famous girlfriend.

PLAYER Y
No one, and can we maybe not talk
like this in front of Molly?

INT. HOME RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

INT. GYM - NIGHT
MOLLY’s working out on a bike in the gym in her building. Her
PHONE BUZZES and she checks the text.
MOLLY (V.O.)
He started texting me--mostly game
stuff but once in a while a joke or
a compliment.

INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

So

MOLLY’s sitting up in bed reading. Her phone rings.

MOLLY (V.O.)
It was around 1am on the night of
the American Music Awards when my
phone rang.

She looks at the caller ID.
MOLLY
(into phone)
Hello?

PLAYER Y
(from the phone)
Where are you?

MOLLY (V.O.)
He was hammered.
MOLLY
Are you alright?

MOLLY
(into phone)
I am.

in

PLAYER Y
(from the phone)
Are you home?

PLAYER Y
Where is your home?

MOLLY
(into phone)
Listen, bud, you’re wasted. Can you
get home?
PLAYER Y
(from the phone)
I want to come over.

MOLLY’s in a tough spot and needs to navigate this
carefully...

*

MOLLY
(pause)
Do you think that’s a good idea?
PLAYER Y
I want to hang out with you outside
that room with those idiots staring
at you.

So

MOLLY
(pause)
How were the AMA’s?

PLAYER Y
A lot of fake people. Viners and
YouTube stars. I sang like I was in
the high school play.I’m having a
low self-image moment. What are you
wearing?
I’m sorry?

*

MOLLY

PLAYER Y
I want to tell you something.

rk

(beat)
Go ahead.

MOLLY

*
*

PLAYER Y
No, I want to whisper it in your
ear.
MOLLY

Listen--

in

PLAYER Y
It’s not a bad idea. It’s not, I’ve
thought about it. You broke up with
your boyfriend and I went alone
tonight so what does that say about
the state of my, uh, you know... I
think about you all the time. You
are so cool. And nice. I’m in a car
right now, I want to come over.
MOLLY
(beat)
You’re not driving the car, right?
PLAYER Y
Where do you live?

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

105.

MOLLY
Okay, listen to me. You’re drunk
and I’m not so I’m gonna be team
captain, okay? I want you to hang
up the phone and think about this
for 30 minutes. Drink a lot of
water, get some air and think about
this for 30 minutes. If you’re
still sure it’s a good idea in 30
minutes, call me back.

So

PLAYER Y
(from the phone)
I think--No, I know I’m falling in--

MOLLY hangs up.

MOLLY (V.O.)
He didn’t call back.

INT. LUXURY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
The players are doing their pre-game mingling.

MOLLY (V.O.)
At the game Tuesday night he was
sheepish and said--

PLAYER Y
(whispering)
I passed out. Thank you, you’re a
class act.
MOLLY
(whispering)
Don’t worry about it.

in

PLAYER Y
(whispering)
I’m writing you an email.

MOLLY
(whispering)
You don’t have to do that.

PLAYER Y
(whispering)
It’s in draft. When I get it right
I’ll hit send.

INT. MOLLY’S CAR - NIGHT
It’s late at night and MOLLY’s driving along Sunset.

*

MOLLY (V.O.)
I assumed the email was going to be
an apology which really wasn’t
necessary--that he was embarrassed,
that kind of thing.
*

MOLLY (V.O.)
It turned out it was an invitation
to go with him to Cabo San Lucas.

*

So

Her PHONE BUZZES on the passenger seat and she answers.

EXT. MOLLY’S CAR - SAME TIME

We’re on the outside of the car now.
PLAYER Y (V.O.)
I’ve only ever had one fantasy. I’m
sitting on a plane and a beautiful
woman sits down next to me. I’m
messengering you a ticket to Cabo.
Leaves Friday, returns Sunday. Your
seat is 1-B. I’ll be in 1-A.

rk

And then Molly’s car SCREECHES to the side of the road,
almost fishtailing.
MOLLY (V.O.)
It wasn’t until I was finished
reading that I saw that the email
wasn’t from Player Y. It was from
his girlfriend.

in

INT. MOLLY’S CAR - SAME TIME

MOLLY’s sitting there breathing, trying to think. Her cell
starts ringing in her hand...
MOLLY (V.O.)
His girlfriend had gone into his
account and found the letter in
drafts. And she sent it to me. And
she sent it to the wives and
girlfriends of everyone who played
in the game. And I knew the truth
even before I answered the call
that came next.
MOLLY finally answers the phone--

PLAYER X
(over phone)
You are so fucked.
MOLLY takes a beat and snaps the phone closed. Then she gets
out of her car, which is on the side of the street, and leans
against it with the occasional car passing by.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
You didn’t have to be a strategic
mastermind to know what was coming
next. The musician and his
girlfriend stayed together on the
condition that he not play in my
game and that was all Player X
needed to get the other guys to
fire me. I’d made a dumb joke about
an anti-trust suit and I never ran
another game in LA.

MOLLY and CHARLIE have been at it for a while.
CHARLIE
There’s no such word as
verticality.
MOLLY
Verticality?

MOLLY
It’s a word.

in

CHARLIE
In the book, on page 217. When you
lose the game in LA and come to New
York you admire the city’s
verticality.

CHARLIE
I don’t think so. Once you’re in
New York you talk about games that
lasted all night, two nights, being
up for days but you don’t mention
drugs.
MOLLY
There were drugs. I’m two years
clean.

CHARLIE
You left the drugs out of the book.
MOLLY
You know what, I’m not paying

CHARLIE
Well so far you’re not paying me
anything.

Yeah.

INT. AGENT’S OFFICE - DAY

MOLLY’s talking to her agent, LOIS.

in

LOIS
If you guarantee the publishers
certain elements--if you’re able to
guarantee that--then I can get you
a million and a half which you’d
probably double in sales plus
ancillary rights.

What kinds of elements?

LOIS
Well you know what kind.

MOLLY

MOLLY
I’m one-thousand percent sure that
the homeless Vietnam vet has a
better one.

*

LOIS
You have one asset. Write your
story and I can get you a million
and a half and that’s the floor.
Write about a girl from Loveland
who gets rich and then loses
everything in a civil forfeiture
and no one--listen to me--no one
will care. Not the publishers and
not the readers.

*
*
*

rk

So

LOIS
You have to use real names. You
have to name the bold-faced names.
You have to tell tales and those
tales have to be compelling and
that’s just the way it is.
(pause)
There’s a guy who sits outside my
Starbucks with a cardboard sign
that says, “Vietnam Vet” and every
morning I give him a quarter and
right now the only difference
between you and him is that you
have a story.

*
*
*
*
*

*
*
*

MOLLY
(pause)
It’s none of my business but you
should really give that guy more
than a quarter.

in

LOIS
Millions or nothing. Go big or go
home and live with your mother. For
the rest of your life.
This is excruciating for MOLLY...

MOLLY
(pause)
What if I...What if you told the
publishers that I’ll name the
players who were already named in
the Brad Marion deposition?
All four?

They’re gonna want to know what
stories you’re willing to tell. You
spent 8 years in Hollywood and 2
years in New York running the
world’s most exclusive, glamorous
and decadent man cave. So what do
the publishers get from you about
people with real names?

*
*

So

MOLLY

use the real names of the players
who were already named by Bad Brad,
what if I did that?

I’d met them a few years earlier on
a G-5 to Vegas.
CHARLIE
How did you have occasion to be on
a private jet to Vegas with Playboy

often had occasion to be on private
jets to Vegas with Playboy
Playmates. What’s our plan?

CHARLIE
The first thing I’m gonna do is get
you a minor role reduction, get the
12 points knocked down to 10.
MOLLY
What’s a minor role reduction?
CHARLIE
I’m gonna argue to the prosecutor
that you didn’t play a leadership
role. That you were an employee who
was hired and fired by the players.

So
MOLLY
Not a chance.

CHARLIE
I think we’ve got a good chance.
MOLLY
No, there’s not a chance I’m gonna
let you make that argument.
Why not?

CHARLIE

rk

MOLLY
It’s not true.

CHARLIE
Let me explain how the point system
works.

in

MOLLY
I know how it works. Points
correspond to the prosecutor’s
sentencing recommendation. You try
to get point reductions based on a
variety of factors including, say,
prior criminal history, which I
don’t have, or whether the
defendant played a minor role,
which I certainly did not.
CHARLIE
You really think this is a good
time to hog credit?
MOLLY
I built it from scratch.

CHARLIE
There was already a game at the
Viper Room when you came along.

MOLLY
The LA game was legal, I wasn’t
taking a rake. I’m talking about
the New York game which I built and
scaled from scratch. I wasn’t
fireable from the New York game, I
made sure of that, so...no.
CHARLIE
I wasn’t really listening.

So

MOLLY
I’m refusing you permission to seek
a minor role reduction. I’m
refusing you permission to
invalidate my entire career.
CHARLIE
I’m not caring.
MOLLY

Charlie--

CHARLIE
Do you want kids? Are you
interested in having a family?

rk

MOLLY
Absolutely.

CHARLIE
I don’t get some point reductions
and the sentencing recommendation
guidelines say 8 to 12 years,
Molly. That’s before they try to
jam you up more with money
laundering.

MOLLY

Money--

CHARLIE
The moment you changed the
Russians’ money for chips.

INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

MOLLY’s sitting at her kitchen table, wearing the sweatshirt

to her iPod and staring into space. She’s depressed and we’ll

I wanted to talk it out with
someone.
MOLLY picks up a magazine and starts thumbing through it.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
That was it, that’s what was making
me angry. It was that there weren’t
any rules. These power moves
weren’t framed by right and wrong,
just ego and vanity.

MOLLY, JESSE and two other Playmates--SHELBY and WINSTON, are
sitting at a table with a “reserved” sign on it. Their spent
drinks are being replaced with a new round.

this game in London, Tokyo and
Dubai. At the end of that year I
reported an income of four-million,
seven-hundred and seventy-three
thousand dollars. Every square inch

Casinos have discovered that
certain scents make people more
likely to place big bets. The

custom candles made.

eleven stools were placed around it
exactly twelve inches apart.

--A case of chips is opened and stacks counted. The chips are
beautiful and heavy and engraved with Molly’s initials.
Included among the chips are rectangular gold plates that say
“MB” but have no denomination.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I used custom chips and two dealers
who worked an hour on, an hour off
with a new crew coming in after
twelve hours.

--The female dealer, a tall knockout, fans a deck out in
front of her and sweeps it up with one card. She repeats this
as well as a few other simple tricks that show how fast and
nimble her hands are.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I’d been working with a new dealer
named Small, that was her name, and
Small was 5-11. She’d been working
in trashy card rooms on the east

Hey Cole.

MOLLY

COLE

So
Hey.

MOLLY
Hey, can I show you something on

KEN
Is it Michigan/Michigan State? I
took State and the points.

MOLLY clicks her TV on with the remote. The TV’s showing a
quad split of tape from four security cameras trained on a
poker game.
MOLLY
This is last Tuesday night’s game.
COLE
Shit. Molly. If the guys find out
you’ve got cameras on them--

MOLLY

Uh-huh.

COLE
What is this?

So

MOLLY
Come on, Cole. 1:07 you lose the
hand to Boosty. 1:08.

Our sheets say you didn’t buy in
again between 1:06 and 1:08 but
look at that--your stack got
bigger.

So let’s rewind. This screen’s got
the dealer changeover while at the
same time back on this screen...
aaaaaand--there we are.

We PUSH IN on the TV and see COLE drop his hand below the
table--presumably into his jacket pocket--take out a
cigarette and casually drop some chips in front of himself
like he’d been playing with the chips all along.

MOLLY (CONT’D)
And that’s why I can’t reconcile
seventeen-thousand dollars from
Tuesday’s game.

A 7-11’s got security cameras on
their Slushy machine, I’ve got a
million dollars changing hands
every two minutes, imbecile, you
didn’t think I had eyes on the
table?
COLE starts breathing heavily--

MOLLY (CONT’D)

MOLLY
I know, so why isn’t it coming out
of the trust fund.

COLE
I’d need my parents’ permission and
they’d kill me. You don’t even
understand--

So

MOLLY
Alright. Look, first of all, those
guys who make the counterfeit
chips, they’re taking you for a
ride. They know there are
signatures built into the chips-exact weight, infra-red markings-breathe. Second, don’t try this at
someone else’s game because they’re
gonna express their anger in a much
different way than I am. I’ll cover
you, You owe me 17-thousand dollars
and when I get it I’ll give you the
tape. That’s it.

Your exposure’s crazy, Molly. It’s
not if, it’s when. You’re gonna get
stiffed and your risk is nuts.

in

MOLLY
It was 17-thousand dollars.

SMALL
This time. You told me what
happened with Harlan Eustice.
MOLLY
He paid.
SMALL
That time.

MOLLY
If I took a rake this game would no
longer be legal.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

127.

SMALL
And if you can’t cover a debt this
game will no longer exist. You’re
the bank now, you’re guaranteeing
the game.
MOLLY doesn’t say anything...

*

So

SMALL (CONT’D)
(sitting up)
Alright. But if you see a hand you
don’t want to carry, just look at
me, flash me a number and I’ll take
that number off the table. Most
runners cap it at 5 percent. I’ll
see you out there.
MOLLY
See you out there.

SMALL goes back out into the main room and MOLLY starts
filling in another check. She stops, thinks, takes a couple
of pills, chews them up and washes the bad taste down with
champagne as we -CUT TO:

INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE - LATER

A hand is underway with SMALL dealing. MOLLY watches from a
short distance as the pot gets bigger and bigger.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Around 2am there was a pot that was
up to a million and a half pre-flop
with five players still in.
SMALL burns a card and lays out the flop.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
My hope was that the flop would
chase four of them off.
PLAYER #1
A hundred-thousand.
Call.

PLAYER #2

PLAYER #3
Call and raise a hundred-thousand.
SMALL
Two-hundred thousand to you.

MOLLY (V.O.)
There was now two-point four
million on the table.

So
Call.

PLAYER #2

MOLLY (V.O.)
Two-point six million.
Call.
Call.

PLAYER #3
PLAYER #4

MOLLY (V.O.)
Three million.

rk

SMALL burns another card and lays out the turn. MOLLY’s
thinking.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
She was right, I was extending
credit, big numbers. And it’s not
like Harlan Eustice hadn’t already
put the fear of God into me. If I
couldn’t pay, one time, that’d be
the end of the game. I was the
house.

She catches SMALL’s eye and holds up two fingers while
mouthing “Two”.

SMALL’s quick hands begin to stack the chips in the pot,
knocking two percent off one of the stacks, tapping those
chips on the table so the players know she’s doing it and
sliding the chips to the side.
MOLLY (V.O.)
That’s how quickly I’d made the
decision. And just as quickly,
Small calculated two percent of the
pot and took it off the table. That
was it.

CUT TO:
INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
We see the remnants of a game that ended a short while ago.
MOLLY’s at work on the books with a drink at her side. One of
the players has stayed behind--late 30’s and drunk. He downs
a drink and then pours himself another.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
It’s time to introduce Douglas
Downey ‘cause Downey’s gonna take
us all the way home. Downey was a
drunk and he’d stay after the game
and hang out while I did the books.

DOWNEY brings his newly poured drink over to MOLLY’s area and
takes a seat.
MOLLY (V.O.)
He was hard to understand when he
was drunk and his conversation
openers would always sound like the
title of a detective novel.

DOWNEY
(he sighs--then)
Victim of circumstance.
Yeah.

DOWNEY

proverbial, you know, life.

DOWNEY again brings a drink over to MOLLY who’s doing the
books and barely pretending to pay attention-MOLLY (V.O.)

DOWNEY
I married young, Mol. I married
young and I married dull.

After the game-MOLLY (V.O.)
He talked about wanting a better
life.

So

DOWNEY
If I’d been born in Greenwich
instead of Flushing? New Canaan,
Fifth Avenue? Gone to Rye Country
Day? Princeton? The life I’d have?
The wife I’d have? I’d be a

circumstances. Mol, these are
things I only say to you.
MOLLY

Good call.

INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE - DIFFERENT NIGHT
After the game--

MOLLY (V.O.)
And he’d talk about another game he
played in. It was the Brooklyn
game. The Brighton Beach game where
they played all night and all day.
The game that was populated by
Russians.
DOWNEY
I’m the only Irish guy they let
play. These are the nicest guys
I’ve ever met, Mol.

MOLLY (V.O.)
Then one night Douglas Downey lost
eighty-thousand at my game and
didn’t have it.

DOWNEY
I’m sorry. You’re so, you know,
just, nice. And you’re honest and I
respect your hustle so I just want

So

MOLLY
That the Russians have deep
pockets, are bad at poker, give
action and pay instantly. Bring me
some of those players and I’ll give
you a piece of the game until your

MOLLY
It’s gonna be very short because I
don’t know anything at all that can
help them.
CHARLIE
You don’t know anything that can
help them convict the Russians but
you know things that can help them.

So

MOLLY
Did you know that 97 percent of
federal cases never go to trial?
Even though your chance of being
convicted at trial is a little more
than one in a hundred?

*

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

CHARLIE
If you want to go to trial that’s
fine but it’s gonna cost in the
area of three and a half million
dollars.

rk

MOLLY
Which the Justice Department knows
I don’t have because they took all
my money in a civil forfeiture
which they can do without a warrant
because your property doesn’t have
a presumption of innocence. Then
after I was arrested by 17 agents
holding automatic weapons--totally
necessary and not at all meant to
intimidate me--they gave me two
days to hire a lawyer and appear in
a courtroom on the other side of
the country.

*
*

in

CHARLIE
If you’re saying that everything
that happens in a federal bust from
the moment you’re arrested is
designed to persuade you to plead
guilty, you’re correct.
MOLLY
So tell me all the ways I can help
‘cause I really feel I owe it to
them. Speaking of owing, the IRS
has put a tax lien on the money
they took from me.
CHARLIE
(beat)
None of that--

*

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

138.

MOLLY
Taking my money wasn’t a tax, they
also need me to give them my money.
Or they’ll take it again.

*

CHARLIE
Good to get that off your chest?
MOLLY
It needed to be said.

So

CHARLIE
Not really. So to be clear, you’re
not interested in entering into a
cooperation agreement with the
prosectors.
MOLLY
That’s right.

CHARLIE
Because you feel the Government has
acted--

in

rk

MOLLY
--like the neighborhood
extortionist? No. The U.S.
Attorney’s Office does everything
within the law to fight crime and
also for some reason to keep taking
my stuff, I get it. And if I had
testimony that could lead to the
conviction of a bad guy no one
would have to coerce me into
cooperating. But I don’t. I have
dirt. I have dish. I have gossip.
So my value to the prosecution is
exactly the same as it is to
Hollywood. I’m here to ensure the
New York Post covers the trial. I’m
here to sell tickets.
CHARLIE
Which is nonetheless value to the
prosecution so what we do is
leverage it to get you a favorable
sentencing recommendation or,
better yet, complete immunity.

become a gambling addict.

QUICK FLASHBACK to another scene we saw earlier-INT. LUXURY HOTEL SUITE (L.A.) - NIGHT
A game is underway--

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
MOLLY and her lawyer, BUTTERMAN, are sitting across from
three lawyers in a deposition.
*

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
Federal bankruptcy lawyers were
brought in to recover as much of
the boosted money as they could. I
was sent a subpoena and flew out to
L.A. to be deposed. Sitting next to
me was my attorney at the time,
Louis Butterman.

BANKRUPTCY LAWYER
I apologize, I thought it was Lou.
(to MOLLY)
Can you confirm the names on the
list? This is Tab 27. Can you
confirm that these people--let me
ask this again so it’s clean on the
record--can you confirm that the
people listed here--Tab 27--all
played poker with Brad Marion?

MOLLY
The names on this list were
provided to you by Brad Marion?

record that your game included but
was not limited to the players on
this list.

BUTTERMAN
My name’s Louis. You’ve been
calling me Lou for two hours.

MOLLY
I understand. What I’m trying to
get in the record is that I’m not
the one who provided the list.

On how many occasions did you
invite Mr. Marion to play in the
game?
MOLLY
Mr. Marion asked to be in the game.

BANKRUPTCY LAWYER
That wasn’t my question.

That wasn’t his question.

MOLLY
It’s public record, it was on
television. Donnie Silverman won

INT. GENERIC FBI OFFICE - DAY
A lawyer walks a photograph over to a wall-MOLLY (V.O.)
--and somewhere in an FBI field
office in New York, someone was
pinning my picture to a wall.

So

The lawyer pins Molly’s picture up. We PULL BACK and see the
wall is covered with pictures and lines that form an
organizational chart--including Michael “Miko” Druzhinsky,
“Russian Alex” Gershen, Illya “The Son” Gershen and Helly
Habib.

*

*
*
*

INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
A game is underway.

MOLLY (V.O.)
By this point I was running six
games a week, sometimes at two
different locations in a night.

MOLLY downs a couple of pills with a glass of champagne.

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
And by this point I was addicted to
drugs.

QUICK SHOTS OF DRUGS

We see a series of tight shots of pills being swallowed, cash
being exchanged for two bottles of pills, bourbon being
poured, a leather folding case with a small mirror, metal
straw and razor blade, etc.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
Adderall, Ambien, Xanax, coke,
alcohol, Valium, Ativan, Trazadone-anything that could keep me up for
a few days and knock me out for a
few hours.
INT. MOLLY’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

The sun’s starting to come through the window and MOLLY,
still in her clothes from the night before, is sitting on the
edge of the bed and staring into space.
MOLLY (V.O.)
But I wasn’t just taking them to
stay awake anymore. It was dark and
friendless where I was.

MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I felt like I was in a hole so deep
I could go fracking. It didn’t feel
like depression, it felt more
violent.
INT. LUXURY SUITE - NIGHT
HELLY smacks his hand on the table-HELLY
(flipping his cards)
Fuck you all!

So
--and rakes in his chips.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I was tired of living in the frat
house I’d built for degenerates. I
was tired of the greed--mine, not
theirs. Everybody’s.

INT. MOLLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

*

rk

Once again it’s early morning and MOLLY’s still dressed from
the night before. She’s standing by the window and holding
the curtain cord.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I was sick of being high all the
time, I was sick of only living in
the dark.

MOLLY lets go of the curtain cord and a blackout curtain
drops.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
I couldn’t recognize myself and
what I recognized I couldn’t stand.
INT. LUXURY HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

A game has ended. MOLLY’s reconciling the books and DOUGLAS
DOWNEY is pouring himself a drink.
MOLLY (V.O.)
After a game one night Douglas
Downey surprised me with a
confession after opening with
another detective story title.

DOWNEY sits down next to Molly, takes a drink, and says--

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

148.

DOWNEY
Gut shot on the river.
MOLLY closes her eyes for a second to brace herself against
the incoherent conversation she knows is coming.
DOWNEY (CONT’D)
I want to say something.
MOLLY
Okay.

So

DOWNEY
I want to say something.
MOLLY

(beat)
Okay.

DOWNEY
I’m just gonna say it.
MOLLY

Cool.

rk

DOWNEY
‘Cause there’s a poem--a famous--a
poem about thoughts left
unexpressed. Two roads emerged from
the woods. Do they explode? I don’t
know. You like poetry?
MOLLY
I did until a second ago. I’m gonna
call you a car and--

in

DOWNEY
I’m in love with you.

MOLLY takes a moment before she says-MOLLY
This isn’t happening.

DOWNEY
You’re the woman I’ve always
dreamed of and I’ve been dreaming-MOLLY
Shhhstop it. Listen to me. Doug?
I’m the woman all of you have
always dreamed of. I’m the antiwife. Instead of making you feel
bad about going out every night and
gambling, I encourage it.

MOLLY (CONT'D)
And instead of asking you to cut
down on your drinking, I have
drinks served to you by models who
simultaneously create the
impression that you’re the kind of
guy who can score a dime piece
anytime you want. Do you know who
Circe was?

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

DOUGLAS
Who?
MOLLY

So

Circe.

DOUGLAS
(beat--confused and drunk)
Used to play in Eddie Ting’s game?
MOLLY
Nope, Circe did not play in Eddie’s
game. She was the Greek goddess of
magic and she gave men feasts with
wine and honey and then she turned
them into swine.
DOWNEY

rk

Why?

MOLLY
Fantastic question.

DOWNEY
Well I would never do that to you.

in

MOLLY
Missed the point by miles but
that’s okay. And thanks for the
compliment.
DOWNEY
It wasn’t just an empty--

MOLLY’s packed up her laptop and thrown a few bound stacks of
hundreds into a leather envelope which she’s zipped up and
put in her bag.
MOLLY
Winston and Shelby are gonna close
up and I’ll see you next week.
She heads for the door and we -CUT TO:

EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - SAME NIGHT/DAWN
The city is just waking up.

*

MOLLY comes out of the hotel in a coat and with her bag on
her shoulder. A driver gets out of a black SUV that’s waiting
on the corner and begins calling to Molly as he hustles over
to her-DRIVER (PAT)
(calling)
Hey! No! We’ve gone over this! You
wait for me!

So
MOLLY

Sorry.

PAT
Someone knows about the game, knows
you’re carrying cash--right there
is where they wait and right there
is where they grab your bag. I
can’t run him down in the car
‘cause Fifth Avenue’s one-way.
MOLLY

Sorry.

rk

PAT opens the door and MOLLY gets in the car. Her head is
somewhere else as she looks out the window.
PAT gets in the front and they pull out.

They drive along in silence for a while, MOLLY looking out
the window as the almost-empty city goes by in the grey/blue
light of early morning.

PAT
What sport?

in

MOLLY (CONT’D)
I used to be a competitive athlete.
I didn’t know if you knew that.

MOLLY
Skiing. Freestyle.
PAT
Were you good?
MOLLY
(pause)
I don’t know.
The drive continues--

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

151.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I used Pat for security when I was
going home with cash. He asked me
if I could do him a favor.
INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL BAR (NEW YORK)- DAY
MOLLY, dressed in a business outfit, is sitting at a table
drinking iced tea and working on her laptop.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
He said there were a couple of
hedge fund guys in New Jersey who
wanted to play and he could score
points with them if he was able to
get them a meeting with me. I said
sure and set the meeting for 5pm on
a Thursday at the Four Seasons bar,
knowing that if they were legit
they’d recognize someone in the
crowd at Happy Hour at the Four
Seasons right after the closing
bell.

MOLLY spots two men enter the hotel bar. One of them is
wearing a shiny brown suit with a t-shirt and a bullet on a
chain. The other is wearing a black shirt and black jeans.

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
It turns out I didn’t need to be
that clever. These weren’t finance
guys, they were from the cast of
Jersey Boys. They stood at the
entrance to the bar selfconsciously--they were out of their
element and tough guys try to look
tougher when they’re insecure.

in

MOLLY stands up and gives them a small wave and they make
their way over to the table.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I had a good hunch what they wanted
and I was gonna have to shut down
this meeting quickly but without
being rude to Joey Bag-a-Donuts and
Secaucus Sal.
MOLLY
(shaking hands)
I’m Molly Bloom, nice to meet you.
JOHN G
I’m John G.

MOLLY
(to the other)
And you are?
PAUL
(not interested in giving
his name)
Ah.
MOLLY motions subtley to a waiter--

*

So

MOLLY
Can I get you guys a drink?
MOLLY (V.O.)
I don’t remember what the big guy
ordered but I’ll never forget what
John G had. He looked at the waiter
as if to say that he could handle
himself among the Manhattan elite
and said-JOHN G
I’ll have an Appletini.

rk

MOLLY
(beat)
Okay, alright.

JOHN G
So...How was your week?

*

JOHN G
Pat’s a good guy, you like Pat?

*
*

MOLLY
Do I like--yes. He’s been my driver
for almost two years.

*
*
*

JOHN G
Driver and security.

*
*

MOLLY

in

MOLLY
My week? It was fine, thank you.
Pat said you might be interested in
a game.

Sometimes.

MOLLY

No.

JOHN G

rk

Yeah.

JOHN G
Just Pat your driver.
MOLLY

Mm-hm.

JOHN G
That must be hard.

in

MOLLY

It’s fine.

JOHN G
We want to partner with you. We’ve
talked to Irv, Will-PAUL
Eddie Ting.

JOHN G
--Eddie Ting, we’re gonna work with
them too. We can make your life

stiff you.

There’s a long silence before...
MOLLY
(pause)
I appreciate your offer but I’m
really fine. I don’t carry a big
debt sheet, I feel safe--

So

JOHN G
Ahh. You lied just then.
(beat)
When you said you don’t carry a big
debt sheet. You’ve got two 2.8million on the street right now,
right as we’re sitting here, we do
our research. That money should be
in your hands ‘cause you owe it to
people

MOLLY looks at the two of them for a moment...

rk

MOLLY
Fellas, I’m sorry, it’s just a
friendly game with higher stakes.
It’s nice to meet you though. Let
me know if there’s ever anything I
can do for you, I like to do
favors. They’ll put your drinks on
my card.

MOLLY gets up and heads out and suddenly we -SNAP TO BLACK

We sit in silence for a moment before...

FADE IN:

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
There are some gaps in my memory,
which they say is common when
you’ve had what they call an event.
For instance I don’t remember where
I was coming from and I don’t
remember walking into my building.
Just that my doorman, Reggie, said
he had packages for me.

INT. MOLLY’S BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

It’s decorated for Christmas as MOLLY walks in from outside
and heads to the elevators.

REGGIE
Ms. Bloom, I think I’ve got some
things for you in the package room,
I’ll bring them on up.
MOLLY
Thanks, Reg.
INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOLLY’s running a bath for herself.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
It was a night off and my plan was
to take a bath and to try not to
take drugs.

*

The DOORBELL rings--

MOLLY (V.O.)
Reggie came up with my packages.

MOLLY unlocks the front door and begins to open it. As soon
as she does the door flies open and a STRANGER--a heavy set
man in his 50’s--pushes MOLLY back into the apartment and
slams the door shut behind him and locks it.

rk

MOLLY
I’m sorry, you’re in the wrong-Wait, just hang on--

The STRANGER grabs MOLLY by the throat and slams her head
against the wall.

*

*
*

in

STRANGER
Shut the fuck up. You need to shut
your fuckin’ mouth right now, you
follow me?

He flings her head against the other wall and SLAMS HER INTO
IT HARD-STRANGER (CONT’D)
Do you get me?

*
*
*

MOLLY
(barely a rasp)
Yes.
STRANGER
Open your mouth.

MOLLY’s frozen. The STRANGER slaps her hard across the face.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

156.

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Open your mouth.
MOLLY opens her mouth a little and the STRANGER takes out a
gun and puts it between her teeth.

*
*
*

STRANGER (CONT’D)
You’re gonna keep quiet now.
MOLLY’s teeth are chattering against the gun.
STRANGER (CONT’D)
Nod that you understand.

So

MOLLY nods slightly. The STRANGER takes the gun out of her
mouth and puts it to her head.
STRANGER (CONT’D)
Walk to the bedroom.

The STRANGER walks her down the hall toward the bedroom.
STRANGER (CONT’D)
They say you got a smart mouth.
What else can that mouth do?

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

rk

The STRANGER throws MOLLY down on the bed and MOLLY turns
over so she’s sitting up by the headboard.

*

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

MOLLY
I have a lot of money, it’s all
cash.
Where?

STRANGER

in

MOLLY
In the safe.

The STRANGER grabs MOLLY by the hair-Where?

*

STRANGER

MOLLY
In the closet. Right here.

He drags MOLLY by the hair to the safe and pushes her to her
knees and gestures toward the safe with the gun.
MOLLY taps her code into the keypad and the door swings open,
revealing rubber-banded stacks of hundreds and some jewelry
boxes as well as documents.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

157.

STRANGER
Give me the cash and the jewelry.
Put it in a bag.
MOLLY grabs one of her designer bags and puts the cash and
jewelry inside.
Okay.

*

STRANGER (CONT’D)

The stranger stoops down to MOLLY and grabs her face, shoving
it up against his.

So

STRANGER (CONT’D)
You don’t call the shots, you
little cunt. This is your fault.

He pulls her to her feet by her hair.
STRANGER (CONT’D)
If you weren’t such a bitch to my
friends, I wouldn’t have to do this
now.

He slams MOLLY’s head into the wall. It knocks her semiconscious. Then he punches her in the face. He punches her in
the face again.

*
*
*

rk

Her face is covered with blood as she backs away as far as
she can into the closet. She’s having a hard time breathing
as she chokes on her own blood. He punches her again. Then he
grabs her and pulls her to her feet and out of the closet.
He takes his gun out of his jacket.

MOLLY
Please don’t. I have a family.

in

STRANGER
Yeah. Your mom lives alone in
Keystone, Colorado.
(beat)
Right?
(beat)
Right, Molly?
MOLLY shakes her head “no”-MOLLY
No, my mother--

STRANGER
Yeah she does.
He smacks her bloody face as hard as he can.

*
*

*
*
*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

158.

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Open your eyes. Open your eyes,
Molly.
She’s barely conscious but she opens her eyes...
STRANGER (CONT’D)
It wasn’t an offer they made. It
wasn’t a suggestion. This’ll be
your only reminder.

*
*

So

The last punch knocks her unconscious. She lies there as we
HEAR the stranger’s footsteps walk away off-screen, then the
door opening and closing.
We move through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES---MOLLY still unconscious on the floor.
MOLLY (V.O.)
So that happened.

--MOLLY pulling herself up to lock the deadbolt on the front
door and then sliding back down to the floor.

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
I couldn’t call a doctor or go to
an E.R. They’d take one look at me
and call the police.

--Blood and water swirling down a shower drain.
MOLLY (V.O.)
My eyes were swollen and black, my
lips were cut and bloody--

--MOLLY holds a folded, wet towel to her face, then lifts her
face off the towel and looks in the mirror.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
--there was dried blood caked all
over my neck and chest and I
couldn’t feel my face. It was
Christmas Eve.

--MOLLY sits alone, staring into space in her darkened
apartment, lit only by the city lights out the window.
MOLLY (V.O.)
Pat had set up the meeting. And he
was how they knew where I lived.

--MOLLY closes the blackout curtains in her bedroom against
the daylight and then picks up a bag of ice and holds it
against her face.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

159.

MOLLY (V.O.)
I stayed in my apartment for two
weeks waiting for my face to heal
and waiting for the phone call I
knew was coming.
--MOLLY checks her phone.
MOLLY (V.O.)
But the call didn’t come. Where was
the call from Joey Bag-a-Donuts
saying--

So

--She checks her phone again.

MOLLY (V.O.)
--”So maybe you’ve had a change of
heart?”

--MOLLY opens her front door and there’s a stack of
uncollected newspapers there.
MOLLY (V.O.)
After 10 days I opened my front
door for the first time. People
were coming back into town after--

rk

--She’s going through the newspapers, throwing out the old
ones after she scans the front page.
MOLLY (V.O.)
--New Year’s in Cabo and St. Bart’s
and South Beach. My phone was
blowing up with “When’s the next
game?” But nothing from John G.
MOLLY discards a newspaper...and then looks at it again.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
And then right there on the front
page of the The New York Times from
8 days ago-INSERT OF THE TIMES HEADLINE--

MOLLY (V.O.)
“Nearly 125 are Arrested in
Sweeping FBI Mob Roundup.” Those
guys were either laying low or they
were in custody. Sometimes God
happens fast.

INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOLLY’s face is almost healed and she’s applying make-up to
cover a dark spot under her eye.
MOLLY (V.O.)
My face had healed enough so that a
little make-up would cover the
bruises that were left. I put
together a week of games.
INT. MOLLY’S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

So

She’s getting dressed in one of her killer outfits.
MOLLY (V.O.)
One week of games to get the 2.8million I’d loaned out in credit
and then I was out, I was done. One
week of epic games. I had some of
my London players in town and the
Russians had visiting friends from
Moscow.

DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
I would never tell them anything
about--I said, “Guys, you want me
to go further, you want me to go
other places, I’ll do it. But
nothing about Molly, she can’t be
touched. Just the Russians.”

*
*

So

MOLLY
Who’s bathroom?

MOLLY
Doug, you’re drunk and a little
hard to understand so I’ll see you
in a few minutes when I get there.
DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
Securities fraud.

MOLLY

never help them build a case
against you? I would never--

in

Hang on--

DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
--give them anything against you?
commit perjury before I did that.

go other places but not you. I love
you whether you--

*
*

MOLLY
Doug! Listen to me! I need you to
pull it together for a second.

MOLLY’s other phone starts BUZZING and she glances at it-DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
I love you whether you believe me
or not.
MOLLY
Are you informing for the FBI?

rk

DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
Should I have told you? That’s a
question that’ll, you know, that’ll
haunt me for my days. For my days,
Molly, but-MOLLY
You’re an FBI informant?

in

DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE)
I told them anyone but Molly.
Always know that I was trying to
protect you.

MOLLY’s grabbed her other phone and looks at the text from
Shelby-“FBI is here!!! Stay away!!!”

DOUGLAS (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
You’re someone I want to know so
bad. I mean really know. Do you
ever think to yourself--

MOLLY tosses the phone down and bolts to her bedroom where
she grabs a weekend bag and starts throwing things into it.

Five blocks away the FBI had raided
my game.

I logged into my bank account where
the balance should have read a
little more than 5-million dollars.
MOLLY stares at something we can’t see. She’s expressionless.
Then we see the screen--

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
It said I had negative 9-million,
nine-hundred and ninety-nine
thousand, nine-hundred and ninetynine dollars and ninety-nine cents
along with a note to contact the
U.S. Attorney’s Office. My bank
assets had been seized.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM IN A FEDERAL BUILDING - NIGHT

rk

MOLLY and CHARLIE are sitting across a table from HARRISON
WELLSTONE and BRENNAN, two prosecutors in their 30’s.
BRENNAN
And she flew to Denver.

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

in

CHARLIE
She flew to Denver where her mother
picked her up and drove them both
to her mother’s home in Keystone.
That was two years ago. It’s been
two years since Ms. Bloom ran a
game. I want to mention as well
that two days after arriving in
Keystone she voluntarily checked
herself into a 28-day rehab and has
been clean and sober for two years.

MOLLY, in jeans, a t-shirt, and a baseball cap, is waiting on
line at the checkout along with a half-dozen others--all
women.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

165.

MOLLY (V.O.)
My third week at rehab they took us
on a field trip to a grocery store
because most addicts have to be
reintroduced to simple things like
making your bed and buying eggs.
One of the women further up in the line sees something on the
magazine rack and pulls it off. She begins excitedly talking
to the others next to her and flipping through the pages.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
At the check-out line I saw one of
my roommates pull a magazine off
the rack. She started looking at me
and back at the magazine and back
at me. Then she showed me the cover
and said, “Is this you?!” It was
me, along with four of the players
from the Hollywood game, including
Player X and Player Y.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

MOLLY sits on the curb reading the magazine.

CUT BACK TO:

in

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
They’d gotten a hold of someone’s
deposition from the Brad Marion
bankruptcy suit. The game was run
by a cocktail waitress turned poker
princess who, they said, provided
the players with drugs and
prostitutes. A blind quote referred
to Donnie Silverman, who they misreferenced as a winner of the World
Poker Championship. I can’t be a
hundred percent sure that Louis
Butterman gave my deposition to the
tabloids, but I’m a hundred percent
sure Louis Butterman gave my
deposition to the tabloids.

INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

CHARLIE
And during the two years she lived
with her mother in Keystone she
wrote the book you have there.

BRENNAN
Were the women who worked for you
call girls?
No sir.

MOLLY

BRENNAN
They never exchanged sex for money?
No.

MOLLY

So

BRENNAN
Have you ever exchanged sex for
money?
No.

CHARLIE

MOLLY
I think he was talking to me.
CHARLIE
I meant no, she’s not answering
that question. The purpose of this
meeting-HARRISON

rk

I know.

CHARLIE
The purpose of the meeting-HARRISON
We’re off the record.
CHARLIE
No we’re not.

in

HARRISON
Do you see a stenographer in here?

CHARLIE
Yes, we are off the record inasmuch
as there’s no record but you’re
free to act on information that
you’re given and we’re not giving
it to you for free. I’ve been
sitting at this table for five
hours, waiting for the opportunity
to implore you to do the right
thing while begging my client for
the last three weeks to act in her
own best interest. And neither of
those things should be hard.
(pause)

167.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
The purpose of this meeting is for
you to meet Molly Bloom and
discover, as I have, that she’s not
the person the press has invented.
HARRISON
She’s not under federal indictment
for getting bad press, Charlie. And
the purpose of the meeting, for me,
is to discover if your client is
willing to cooperate with the
government in putting away some bad
people.

So
No.

MOLLY

HARRISON
You’re not willing to cooperate?
MOLLY
No, I’ve never traded sex for
money.
(beat)
I’m still not sure if there’s a
record but if there is I wanted to
make sure that was in it.

rk

HARRISON
It appears to me that throughout
your career as a gamerunner you
were extremely diligent about
vetting the players.
I was.

MOLLY

in

HARRISON
But you let four guys play in the
game without knowing they were
connected?

MOLLY
Plus an FBI informant, it’s pretty
embarrassing.
They’re still waiting for an answer.

MOLLY (CONT’D)
(beat)
I was high at the end and doing my
job badly. I’ll also add that in my
limited experience with the Russian
mob, they don’t give many clues
that they’re mobsters. In my
experience with the Italian mob on
the other hand--

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

Help us.

168.

HARRISON

MOLLY
I don’t know anything that can help
you.
Yes-If I did--

HARRISON

*
*

MOLLY

*
*

So

HARRISON
Yes you do. You can provide color.
(beat)
You can paint a picture. You can
tell us that Druzhinsky wore a
Rolex and drove a Phantom. You can
tell us that Illya Gershen showed
up with a quarter-million dollars
cash in a backpack and you can tell
us how much action Helly was taking
on a sports bet.

MOLLY’s starting to get dizzy from this but she’s fighting
through it.

rk

MOLLY
(pause)
Uh...No one was allowed to place
sports bets from the room, they had
to go outside--I’d have no idea how
much anyone was taking or laying.
BRENNAN
So now you’re saying you knew they
were making and taking sports bets?

Molly?
Yes sir.

in

MOLLY
No sir, that was the point of them
leaving the room. They could’ve
been calling their mothers for all
I knew.
HARRISON
MOLLY

HARRISON
I don’t believe you. In Mike
Druzhinsky’s phone intercepts alone-just Druzhinsky--your name comes
up nineteen times. “

HARRISON (CONT'D)
We need Molly,” “Get Molly,” “Bring
Molly”--it strongly suggests that
you were important to his business
and so it’s hard to believe that
someone with your savvy and obvious
intellect--

*
*

MOLLY
They’re talking about the drug.
(beat)
“Get molly”, “Bring molly”, “We
need molly”, they’re talking about
the drug, ecstacy.

So

There’s a long silence in the room...and then CHARLIE can’t
help laughing-CHARLIE
Shit. My office was next to yours
for two years and I saw you make
some bone-headed moves but I’ve
never seen any prosecutor step in
it the way you just did. You should
thank all of the gods that there’s
no physical record of that
exchange.

HARRISON

Look--

CHARLIE
No you look, Harry--

*

HARRISON
You gonna implore me to do the
right thing?

in

CHARLIE
(shouting)
You caught a dolphin in a tuna net
and you know it!

The rage that’s been building up in CHARLIE for hours if not
weeks--maybe years--has finally exploded.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
(beat)
Molly Bloom does not belong in a
RICO indictment, are you outta your
minds?! She does not belong in a
mob indictment, she raked a game,
that’s it, for seven months two
years ago. Why? Because she was
giving credit in the millions and
she didn’t want to use muscle to
collect.

CHARLIE (CONT’D)

in

rk

So

(pause)
She’s had opportunity after
opportunity to greatly benefit
herself by simply telling the real
stories she knows. I have the
forensic imaging going back to 2007-text messages, emails--movie
stars, rock stars and billionaires
who were explicit--some of them
married with kids--but that’s the
tip of the iceberg. A guy comes
this close to being named U.S.
Ambassador to Monaco, he’s
withdrawn from consideration at the
last minute and nobody knows why.
She does. CEOs with college-age
mistresses, an SVP of an investment
bank who wanted her to help him put
a marked deck in the game, the head
of a movie studio who texted her
that a particular star was too
black for his taste, J. Edgar
Hoover didn’t have this much shit
on Bobby!
(beat)
She could’ve written a best seller,
she could have been set for life,
she’s got the winning lottery
ticket and she won’t cash it.
She settled the Brad Marion suit
for a half a million dollars just
so she wouldn’t have to testify and
that was only the first time you
guys cleaned her out. Your office
took every dollar she had in a
Constitutionally fucked up seizure
and then you put the IRS on her to
tax the money you seized? I’ve been
in those strategy meetings. You
broke her back so she couldn’t
possibly afford to defend herself.
And now she has an opportunity to
guarantee her own freedom by
just...“providing some color”...and
she still won’t do it. This woman
doesn’t belong in a RICO
indictment, she belongs in
Congress. She belongs in the pulpit
of a synagogue, she belongs on a
box of Wheaties. So yes I am, I’m
imploring you to do the right
thing. She knows nothing about the
three Mikes. She knows nothing
about Taiwanchik or the TGO or
insurance fraud.

There’s silence after that long speech. Then HARRISON to
turns to MOLLY--

*
*

So

Between the two of us we’ve
appeared in front of this judge 28
times as prosecutors and not once
has he deviated from our sentencing
recommendations, he’s not gonna
start now. I know you’ve been
putting this bust together for
three years and there’s no one who
doesn’t want to see mobsters in
jail, including and especially the
only person in this room who’s had
one of them put a gun in her mouth.
Probation. Community service. Or
better yet, consider that all she
did was run a poker game exactly
the same way every casino in
America does and drop the goddamn
charges.

HARRISON
Do you have anything you’d like to
add?

rk

MOLLY
(pause)
I am guilty.

*

HARRISON
(pause)
Yeah.
(beat)
Molly, I’d like to talk to your
lawyer in private if that’s alright
with you.
MOLLY turns to Charlie and CHARLIE nods that it’s okay.

in

CHARLIE
Can you get some dinner for an hour
and then meet me back at the
office?
Yeah.

MOLLY

EXT. CORNER OF FIFTH AVE. AND CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - NIGHT

The city’s decked out for Christmas. MOLLY’s standing in
front of a hot dog cart across the street from the Plaza
Hotel and staring up at her old stomping ground. She turns
suddenly to the hot dog vendor.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

172.

MOLLY
Hm? I’m sorry?
HOT DOG VENDOR
Did you want a hot dog?
MOLLY
(beat)
Uh...a pretzel please.
MOLLY takes two singles out of her wallet and trades them for
the pretzels.
MOLLY (CONT’D)

So
Thank you.

HOT DOG VENDOR
Merry Christmas.
MOLLY
To you too.

MOLLY walks up the sidewalk a little bit--the street is lined
with carriages and horses. MOLLY stops at the first carriage
and asks the driver-MOLLY (CONT’D)
Is it okay if I feed your horse?

rk

The driver nods, “Sure go ahead.”

MOLLY takes a piece of her pretzel, offers it in her
flattened hand and the horse takes it.
MOLLY (CONT’D)
(whispering)
On my signal, the revolution will
begin, and I will lead us all to
freedom.

in

MOLLY rips her pretzel into a few pieces and drops them in
the horse’s feed bucket. She shoves her hands in her coat
pockets and moves on.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

MOLLY’s walking down a path and the skating rink comes into
view. It’s lit up and the skaters are making their way around
the rink with Christmas music coming from the speakers.
EXT. SKATE RENTAL - NIGHT
MOLLY steps up to the window which is being manned by a
woman.

*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

173.

MOLLY
Hi, I’d like to rent a pair of
skates, size 6, but I just spent my
last two dollars on dinner which I
ended up feeding to a horse. These
are 800-dollar leather Chanel
gloves and I’ll trade you.
SKATE RENTAL WOMAN
800 dollar gloves?

So

MOLLY
Yes. And they keep your hands just
as warm as the 10-dollar kind.
SKATE RENTAL WOMAN
Are you alright?
MOLLY
Mm-hm. I’m divesting.

EXT. SKATING RINK - NIGHT

rk

MOLLY’s finishing lacing her skates on a bench, takes off her
coat and steps out onto the rink. As soon as she begins
skating it’s clear that she knows how to skate. And as she
starts skating faster it’s clear that if she hadn’t chosen
skiing she could’ve had a future in speed skating.
She begins to skate faster and faster--weaving through the
other skaters with impressive grace and athleticism. And
speed. More and more and more speed as she begins her second
lap. Faster. Effortless speed.
Two RINK EMPLOYEES on skates and in orange vests see her and
one of them shouts out--

in

RINK EMPLOYEE
(shouting)
HEY! SLOW DOWN!

MOLLY pays no attention as she flies through the other
skaters.
RINK EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
HEY MISS! SLOW DOWN!

The two rink employees set out chasing after her on their
skates.
RINK EMPLOYEE #2
LADY! SLOW DOWN!!

MOLLY flips around, skating backwards now, just as fast as
she was before.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

174.

MOLLY
(calling back)
Catch me!
(louder)
Come on! Catch me!
MOLLY flips forward again and rockets away. As she passes the
group of observers watching from the railing she hears a
man’s voice off-screen.

*

VOICE (O.S.)
Bend your knees.

So

MOLLY turns around to see who just said that--

*

--it was her FATHER. MOLLY crashes into the railing and falls
down, creating a chain reaction pile-up of skaters who fall
over her and then over each other.
MOLLY
(to the other skaters)
Sorry. Sorry.

The two RINK EMPLOYEES skate up and grab MOLLY by each arm.

rk

RINK EMPLOYEE
We’re taking you off the ice right
now, miss, and if you give us any
trouble we’re calling the police.

As the RINK EMPLOYEES continue to skate MOLLY off the ice
like a prisoner, her father asks simply-FATHER
How’s it goin’?

EXT. BENCH NEAR THE RINK - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

in

MOLLY’s father puts her coat over her as she sits on the
bench.
MOLLY
What are you doing in New York and
how did you know I was at the
skating rink?

*
*
*
*

FATHER
I’m both your father and a doctor
of the mind. I’m in New York
because that’s where you are and I
called your mom at the hotel and
she said you were here. Listen,
it’s not a big deal but from what I
saw out there I think you’re having
a small breakdown.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

175.

FATHER
I would think it was because of the
arrest and not knowing what’s going
to happen.

*
*
*
*

MOLLY
Old man, do you really not
recognize sarcasm?

*
*
*

FATHER
Do you? Drink this.

*
*

So

MOLLY
That’s weird, I can’t think of why.

He’s handed her a styrofoam cup.

*

MOLLY
I can’t drink, I’m an alcoholic but
thanks for remembering.

*
*
*

FATHER
It’s hot chocolate.

*
*

MOLLY

Okay.

rk

FATHER
And for diagnostic purposes, do
you think we’re in a cocktail
lounge right now? ‘Cause if you do
I have to walk you into Bellevue
tonight. Did you know I can do
that? I can institutionalize
people, it’s fantastic. I want to
check your pulse.

in

He takes her wrist and looks at his watch.
MOLLY
(pause)
Dad-FATHER
Hang on.

MOLLY
(pause)
Have you found a pulse?

FATHER
Yeah, I just like looking at this
watch.

176.

MOLLY
Dad, I can see you’re getting
warmed up but I don’t have the
emotional bandwidth to defend my
“as usual irresponsible behavior.”

So

FATHER
I know, I got your e-mail. I get
that I’m not welcome in your life
right now as your father though you
should know I could give a shit if
I’m welcome or not. But I’m not
here in my capacity as your father.
I’m indifferent to whether your
father lives or dies. I’m a very
expensive therapist and I’m here to
give you one free session.
MOLLY
You think what I need right now is
a therapist?

FATHER
(almost laughing)
Yuh-huh!

rk

MOLLY
I have to be back at my lawyer’s
office soon.
FATHER
You like your lawyer?

MOLLY
I wasn’t asking for money when I
called you, dad, I just needed my
dad. And God forbid you part with a
nickel.

in

FATHER
Yeah Tiny Tim, you grew up on a
lake and you’ve skied all over the
world, were those work houses
tough?
MOLLY

MOLLY does as she’s told. There’s a long silence before...
FATHER (CONT’D)
(pause)
Alright. We’re gonna do three years
of therapy in three minutes.
MOLLY
How?

So

FATHER
I’m gonna do what patients have
been begging therapists to do for a
hundred years--I’m just gonna give
you the answers.
MOLLY

To what?

FATHER
Well let’s start with this. Why
does a young woman who, at 22, has
a gold-plated resume--why does she
run high-stakes poker games?

rk

MOLLY
Why did I choose to make a lot of
money, that’s a head scratcher.
FATHER
You were gonna be a success at
anything you wanted and you know
it. If you’d gone to law school
you’d have been a partner by now.
Why this?

in

MOLLY
(beat)
I don’t know. Drugs.
Her father waves that off--

FATHER
You didn’t start with drugs until
the end. They weren’t the problem,
they were the medicine. No. It was
so you could control powerful men.
Your addiction was having power
over powerful men.
MOLLY
That’s really what you think?

*
*
*
*

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

178.

FATHER
No, I know it for sure. You’ve now
completed your first year of
therapy.

*
*
*

MOLLY
I saw an opportunity, it wasn’t
about you.
FATHER
It wasn’t just about me.

So

MOLLY
It wasn’t at all about you.
FATHER
It was. Second year, second
question.
MOLLY
Do you think you were a good
husband?
FATHER
What do you care?

rk

MOLLY
I care because you were married to
my mother! I care because my
father’s an asshole!

in

FATHER
Congratulations, you’ve completed
Year Two. For the record, your
father raised three kids on a
college professor’s salary. One of
them is a two-time Olympian, sixthround draft pick of the
Philadelphia Eagles and a leading
philanthropist. Another is a
cardiothoracic surgeon at Mass
General and the third built a multimillion dollar business using not
much more than her wits.
MOLLY
I’m about to plead guilty in a
federal court.

FATHER
Nobody’s perfect. The point is I
must have done a few things right.
Last question.

*

179.
MOLLY
I have to go.
FATHER
Last question, Mol. I’ll answer it
but you have to ask it.
MOLLY
Why didn’t you like me as much as
my brothers?

So

FATHER
There it is. I did. It only from
time to time appeared that I
didn’t.

MOLLY
(pause)
It only appeared that you didn’t?
Yeah.

FATHER

rk

MOLLY
That’s some Category-5 bullshit,
dad. Why would--It only appeared-Why would--Okay, I had an attitude.
I talked back. And I broke some
normal adolescent rules. I snuck
phone time past curfew, I took your
car when I wasn’t allowed to-FATHER
--and drove it into a McDonald’s.

in

MOLLY
And kids get punished for that but
they don’t get--you’d turn into
another person--your voice, your
face, it was-FATHER

stick. It was a one-in-a-million
thing. You tripped over a stick.
That’s what you did wrong.
(pause)
There’s your session. It’s funny
how much faster you can do it when
you’re not charging by the hour.
I’m your father. Trying to
comprehend how much I love you
would be like trying to visualize
the size of the universe.
(pause)
I didn’t know you’d gotten beaten
up until I read it in your book, it
was a helluva way to learn about
it. You should know I’m hiring
someone to find the guy who did it

him.

INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

CHARLIE’s alone in his office with the city flickering out
the window. He’s holding a deck of cards and after a moment,
deals himself two down. He looks at them, then he burns a
card and deals himself the flop. He tosses his hole cards in
the middle and folds.
MOLLY comes and stands in the doorway for a moment...

rk

MOLLY
Did you know that the center of our
galaxy smells like rum and
raspberries? It’s true. At the
center of the galaxy is ethyl
formate, which is the same gas that
gives rum its smell and raspberries
their taste.
CHARLIE
Why do you know these things?

in

MOLLY
To stay busy during games I surfed
the internet. Then I started taking
online courses. I’m 12 credits away
from a degree in astronomy, I
didn’t even know I was enrolled.

I want to thank you for what you
said tonight.
CHARLIE
Molly, there’s a new offer on the
table.
MOLLY
What is it?

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

183.

CHARLIE
We hand over our forensic imaging.
MOLLY
(pause)
I don’t get it.
CHARLIE
We give them the forensic imaging
of your texts and e-mails and in
exchange--

So

MOLLY
In exchange--What could they
possibly offer me to do that?
CHARLIE
Your money back.
(pause)
They’ll return all of your money.

MOLLY takes in that information...doesn’t know whether to
laugh or cry and just says...

*

MOLLY
(pause)
Yeah, that sounds about right.

rk

CHARLIE laughs a little.

MOLLY (CONT’D)
Is that why they took the money in
the first place? So they could
offer it back to me?
CHARLIE
I think they just wanted to buy an
espresso machine.

in

MOLLY
A four and a half million dollar
espresso machine?

CHARLIE
Yeah. Hey, for what it’s worth, if
we were going to trial we’d have to
hand over the forensic imaging in
discovery.
MOLLY
Yes but that’s different from
voluntarily handing it over.
CHARLIE
Sure.

You have to let me keep you out of
prison.
MOLLY
You’ve seen what’s on those hard
drives.
CHARLIE

Yeah--

MOLLY
A lot more than a little color.
CHARLIE
I don’t care.

MOLLY
Careers will be ruined. Families.
Wives, lives on both coasts--

CHARLIE
Listen to me. When a rich guy goes
to jail he spreads money around.
His lawyer knows how to take care
of it. He spreads money around and
you don’t have any. The composition
of female inmates in federal prison-they did not commit financial
crimes. They’re drug dealers and
they get raped by prison guards and
you will not be anonymous, Molly,
you’ll be a target.
MOLLY
Children will read their father’s
text messages saying he wished he’d
never had kids. These guys--

CHARLIE
Where are they?!
(beat)
Why are you in this alone? Where
are your friends? Where’s one guy
saying, “Molly, I know you’re doing
everything you can to save my life,
the least I can do is take care of
your legal bills.”
MOLLY
If this is about paying your fee--

So

CHARLIE
It’s not! I’ll pay my fee, okay?!
MOLLY
You’re gonna pay yourself twohundred and--

CHARLIE
My firm, it’s my firm that gets-where are they, Molly? You kept
their secrets. Where are these
people you’re protecting by not
telling the whole story in the
book, by settling the Brad Marion
suit, by turning down four and a
half million dollars of your own
money and by going to jail? Where’d
everybody go?!

MOLLY
It’s not their names I’m
protecting, Charlie, it’s mine.
CHARLIE
Your integrity?

in

MOLLY
Frame it anyway you want but it’s
still throwing other people under
the bus.

CHARLIE
And you know I admire that but we
have to live in the real world now.
I’m sufficiently convinced that
he’s gonna recommend jail time as a
coercive measure so you don’t have
the luxury of integrity.
MOLLY
I never thought I’d hear you say
that.

No.

CHARLIE
You stay out of jail and you have
your money back to pay your debts
and start a new life.

If this is a self-imposed
punishment for naming the four guys
in the book--

This was all me. Listen up a second

whatever reason, I’ve experienced
men as nocturnal predators.
Degenerate gluttons of sloth. Crass
and stupid misogynists who measure
their worth in worthless ways.

CHARLIE
And then you met me?

So

MOLLY
(pause)
No, Counselor Ego. I’ve known good

EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

*

It’s a freezing cold day. Paparazzi and a couple of TMZ-type
film crews are behind police sawhorses. MOLLY--along with her
MOTHER, FATHER and her two handsome brothers, JORDAN and
JEREMY, step out of a black SUV where they’re met by CHARLIE,
STELLA, and a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS. They head
up the courthouse steps as cameras come to life and some
questions we can’t really make out are shouted and ignored.

MOLLY
You alright?

in

Molly’s MOTHER takes her arm. MOLLY turns to her--

MOTHER
(pause--not allowing
herself to cry)
New Yorkers think this is cold
weather? In Colorado this is a
beach day.
MOLLY
There you are.
(then to her FATHER)
You alright?

FATHER
These people taking pictures and
shouting? The desire-MOLLY
I know.
FATHER
--to punch them as hard as I can in
the mouth-MOLLY
Yeah.

So
FATHER
--is overwhelming.
MOLLY

Yup.

They head into the courthouse as we -CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - A MOMENT LATER

rk

Not too many people. It’s just another day’s business for the
court. The family takes its seats and STELLA takes a seat a
few rows down and on the aisle. HARRISON and BRENNAN are
already at the prosecutor’s table discussing some things.
MOLLY walks in with CHARLIE and they head down to the defense
table.

in

MOLLY
(TO CHARLIE)
Why isn’t Stella in school?
CHARLIE
She insisted.

MOLLY turns and goes back up the aisle and kneels down where
STELLA’s sitting.
MOLLY
(pause)
There’s gonna come a moment in your
life that tests your character.
When that moment comes, it’ll be
better if you don’t have any.

After a moment, STELLA smiles and then laughs a little. MOLLY
gives her a light smack on the knee and joins Charlie at the
table.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

190.

MOLLY (V.O.)
The business of the court began.
We continue semi-MOS as Molly begins narrating over a series
of easy DISSOLVES-MOLLY (V.O.)
We stood for the Honorable Judge
Dustin Foxman and counsel entered
their names for the record.
DISSOLVE:

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
The docket was called and some pro
forma instructions were given to
counsel.

DISSOLVE:

MOLLY and CHARLIE stand up.

MOLLY (V.O.)
And I was asked a series of
questions from a script the judge
had in front of him.

rk

JUDGE FOXMAN
What is your full name?
MOLLY
Molly Dubin Bloom.

JUDGE FOXMAN
How old are you?
DISSOLVE:

in

The questioning continues.

JUDGE FOXMAN (CONT’D)
Have you taken any drugs, medicine
or pills or had any alcoholic
beverages in the past 48 hours?
MOLLY
Sudafed.

JUDGE FOXMAN
Is there anything about the reasons
for your taking Sudafed that would
interfere with what’s going on here
today?

*

191.

No, sir.

MOLLY

JUDGE FOXMAN
I state for the record that I’ve
also taken Sudafed in the last 48
hours.
DISSOLVE:

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
87 questions he was required to ask
before he’d permit me to plead
guilty.
JUDGE FOXMAN
Is your mind clear today, Ms.
Bloom?
Yes it is.

MOLLY

JUDGE FOXMAN
Do you understand what is going on
here today?
I do.

rk

DISSOLVE:

MOLLY

JUDGE FOXMAN
Under the Constitution and laws of
the United States you have a right
to plead to the charges in the
indictment, do you understand that?
MOLLY
Yes Your Honor.

in

DISSOLVE:

JUDGE FOXMAN
And do you understand that?
Yes sir.
DISSOLVE:

MOLLY

JUDGE FOXMAN
At that trial you would be presumed
to be innocent and you would not
have to prove that you were
innocent, do you understand that?

192.

Yes sir.

MOLLY

DISSOLVE:
MOLLY (CONT’D)
Yes Your Honor.
DISSOLVE:
Yes sir.

MOLLY (CONT’D)

So

DISSOLVE:

JUDGE FOXMAN
If you plead guilty and I accept
your plea, you will give up your
right to appeal along with all the
other rights I’ve enumerated, do
you understand?
Yes sir.

MOLLY

rk

JUDGE FOXMAN
Even now as you are entering this
plea you have the right to change
your mind and plead not guilty to
Count Twenty of the indictment and
go to trial, do you understand
that?
MOLLY

Yes sir.

in

JUDGE FOXMAN
Do you understand that you are
charged in Count Twenty with
operating an illegal gambling
business in violation of Title 18
United States Code Sections 1955
and 2?
MOLLY
Yes, I understand.

JUDGE FOXMAN
Understanding everything you’ve
just been told, do you now wish to
enter a plea?
MOLLY
Yes sir.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

193.

JUDGE FOXMAN
How do you plead to the charge?
MOLLY
Guilty, Your Honor.

*

JUDGE FOXMAN
Your plea has been so recorded and
you can take your seat. Before we
move to the sentencing phase I’d
like a word with counsel please.

So

CHARLIE, HARRISON, and BRENNAN all stand up to approach the
bench-MOLLY (V.O.)
And then something happened.

JUDGE FOXMAN
(to CHARLIE)
Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey, just
government counsel.

*

CHARLIE’s a little confused, this is very unusual.
Yes Judge.

CHARLIE

rk

CHARLIE sits back down as HARRISON and BRENNAN have a private
conversation at the bench.
MOLLY
(beat)
What’s going on?

CHARLIE
I don’t know.
The wait continues...

in

MOLLY
(pause)
What is it usually?
CHARLIE
I don’t know.

MOLLY
(pause)
I can’t feel my legs. I’ve never
been this scared in my life.
CHARLIE looks at her...
CHARLIE
Yes you have.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

194.

The JUDGE tells the prosecutors they can step back.
JUDGE FOXMAN
Would the defendant please rise for
sentencing.
MOLLY and CHARLIE stand.

So

JUDGE FOXMAN (CONT’D)
Based on all available information,
this court manifestly disagrees
with the government’s sentencing
recommendation. This courthouse is
located three streets from the
financial district, which is
populated by men and women who will
commit more serious crimes by
lunchtime today than the defendant
has committed in this indictment. I
simply don’t see how either the
People or the cause of justice are
served by locking Molly Bloom in
prison.

We see the family’s reaction--holding their breath, as
CHARLIE closes his eyes a moment and exhales in relief and
anticipation. The JUDGE continues semi-MOS--

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
It was as casual as if he was
ordering lunch off a menu.

JUDGE FOXMAN
Ms. Bloom, this court sentences you
to two-hundred hours of community
service, one year of supervised
probation and drug testing and a
one-hundred thousand dollar fine.
This case is adjourned.

in

He raps his gavel. Everyone rushes a stunned Molly to
congratulate her.
MOLLY (V.O.)
And that was that. There was crying
and hugging, jokes from my brothers-EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

--as MOLLY, CHARLIE, STELLA, and MOLLY’s FAMILY exit and head
down the stairs with CHARLIE casually waving off questions.

*

195.
MOLLY (V.O.)
--tough talk about how no one
messes with the Blooms and levelheaded talk about Christmas
miracles.
INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
The seven of them are having a lively dinner.

So

MOLLY (V.O.)
Steaks and beer bought by my father
and full reenactments.

In the middle of the revelry, we start to slowly PUSH IN on
MOLLY, whose face is beginning to change a little.
MOLLY (V.O.)
And in the middle of it all, as
grateful as you are, the reality
starts creeping toward you like the
tide. And that’s the first time you
have the thought...”What do I do
now?”

CUT TO:

rk

EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY

It’s the slope we were on at the beginning, windy and
forbidding. We’re watching from a few hundred feet away and
we can barely see MOLLY on the ground where she’s just had
her accident. She’s surrounded by EMTs, ski patrol, her coach
and her father. From time to time we’ll see the other skiers
standing by silently, waiting and hoping.

in

We can hear the two TV COMMENTATORS--one male, one female-and a female REPORTER on the ground near the action.
MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
She’s been laying still for about a
minute now. I want to emphasize
again, our cameras can’t get in
there so we don’t know if she’s
conscious.

FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
She fell hard and then kept going
at a punishing speed.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I’m a felon. I’m 35 years old,
unemployed, and pled guilty in a
mob indictment.

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

196.

MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
Molly Bloom is of course the sister
of Jeremy Bloom who holds the
world’s number one ranking. That’s
her longtime coach there, Ted
Keene, and her father.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I owe the government close to twomillion dollars in taxes assessed
on the civil forfeiture plus the
hundred-thousand dollar fine. And
they’re gonna come get it.

So

MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
On the doorstep of making the
Olympic team.
MOLLY (V.O.)
I have a quarter of a million
dollars in legal bills.
FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
She came back from an injury when
she was just 13. Emergency back
surgery. You know I wonder if
Tracy’s got an update for us on the
ground--Tracy?

rk

MOLLY (V.O.)
I don’t know what I’d say in a job
interview, or if I’ll ever be given
a job interview. I won’t know how
to explain this. And for some
reason I’m never allowed to go to
Canada.

in

TRACY (V.O.)
Guys, we’re hearing the chopper
blades down here.

MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
That’s the sound you don’t want to
hear.

FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
They don’t think-MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
Yeah, they don’t think they can get
her off this mountain.
MOLLY (V.O.)
And I’m not allowed to vote.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

197.

FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
If she can hear those chopper
blades-TRACY (V.O.)
She’s moving, guys!
MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
She’s moving.
TRACY (V.O.)
She’s waving off the chopper.

So

We see someone with the ski patrol get on their radio and
look to the sky where the chopper is.
MOLLY sits up even though the EMTs and her father and the
coach are telling her to sit still.
MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
This is something.
TRACY (V.O.)
I’ll tell you guys, as banged up as
she has to be right now, she
appears more angry with herself
than she is hurt.

rk

MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
We can see she’s being helped to
her feet now.

MOLLY takes a towel and wipes the remaining blood off her
face.

in

MOLLY (V.O.)
Did anything good come of this? Not
really. But I learned things. For
instance the largest diamond ever
found isn’t on Earth. It’s a burned
out corpse of a star that’s 50
light years away in the
Constellation Centaurus.
TRACY (V.O.)
She’s on her feet.

MOLLY (V.O.)
It weighs 5-million trillion
trillion pounds which is 10-billion
trillion trillion carats.

*

Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

198.

TRACY (V.O.)
She’s looking back up the slope,
trying to figure out what went
wrong, I’m sure that question’s
gonna haunt her.
MOLLY (V.O.)
So I learned that our galaxy smells
like rum and raspberries and has a
floating diamond the size of
Polaris.
APPLAUSE from all the spectators and officials.

So

FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
You have to wonder about the
psychological toll. Coming that
close after 18 years only to lose
it like that.
MOLLY (V.O.)
And I learned that I’m very hard to
kill.
MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
You and I both know people who’ve
never gotten over it.

rk

FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
I don’t know if the young woman
we’ve just seen is one of those
people. We may not see her ski
competitively again but I think
we’re gonna see her. She’ll be
back.

*

in

As the ski patrol starts to move MOLLY down off the slope,
the camera counters in the other direction--still at a
distance--so that we’re turning to look at the crash site
from a different angle.
And as we continue the camera move, coming into the
foreground of the shot...
...we see the PINE BOUGH.

FEMALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
She’ll be back.
MALE COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
Alright, next up in the gate is
