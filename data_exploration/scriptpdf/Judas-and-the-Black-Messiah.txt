CHICAGO -- 1968

We TRACK BEHIND a billowing raincoat. WILLIAM O’NEAL
(18), dressed like a G-man in a Stetson fedora, slows to
a stop as he reaches a shiny red ragtop Pontiac GTO. He
inspects it, also taking note of where it’s parked:
outside a South Side pool hall. A “CLOSED” sign hangs in
the window.

Cardigan-Clad thrashes, inadvertently headbutting O’Neal,
who loses his hat. He starts to pick it up, then has
second thoughts. Tex gets a clear look at O’Neal for the
first time. He looks like a kid. Suspicious, Tex grabs
his knife off of the pool table.
TEX
You ain’t no fucking cop, nigga.

He unsheathes his blade and takes a step forward.

Alone, O’Neal sits in a metal chair, hands cuffed behind
his back, a nasty gash above his right eye. After a
moment, the door is opened by a cop who grants FBI Agent
Mitchell entry. He drags a table over to O’Neal and
takes a perch on top.
MITCHELL
(producing his badge)
Special Agent Mitchell, FBI.
O’Neal tries to hide how impressed/intimidated he is.
MITCHELL
Almost as spiffy as yours.
Mitchell tosses O’Neal’s fake badge onto the table.

The medium-sized hall is packed with students: about 90%
black. Many wear dashikis, headwraps, and traditional
African garb. FRED HAMPTON (20) sits onstage behind a
COLLEGE STUDENT (18), black, female, who addresses the
crowd from a podium. Rush, Harmon, Palmer, and Winters
stand at attention just off the stage.

Oh, they’ll let you change the

guess what? They still gon’ drag
your black ass to Vietnam to shoot
a poor rice farmer or get shot
your damn-self. That’s the
difference between revolution and
the candy-coated facade of gradual
reform. Reform is just the
masters teaching the slaves how to
be better slaves. Under reform,
you could take the motherfucking
masters out, and the slaves ’still

FRED
There’s a man called a capitalist.
Don’t matter what color he is.
Black, white, brown, red -- don’t
matter. Because the capitalist
has one goal: that is to exploit
the people. He can have a threepiece suit or a dashiki. Because
political power doesn’t flow from
the sleeve of a dashiki.
Political power flows from the
barrel of a gun! We in the Black
Party don’t believe in no culture
except revolutionary culture. What
we mean by that is a culture that
will free you! Don’t give me no
five-and-dime costume of some
medicine man or witch doctor or
whatever you think the motherland
looks like. Give me the righteous
threads of a Mozambican FRELIMO
fighter! Give me an AK-47 or some
bandoliers like they got in
Angola. Gimme some Colt .45s, of
the folks that are trying to free
themselves!

War is violent conflict between

O’Neal doesn’t budge. Fred stares daggers for a moment.

Evening, brothers and sisters. I

breakfast program opening on the
South Side next week. Free for
the babies. All you gotta do is
drop your little ones off and
we’ll take care of the rest. Stop
on by to St. Andrews and check us
out. And if you’re on the West
Side or got family on the West
Side, we at the Better Boys Club
Monday through Friday.

Fred expands his message to the pool hall at large.
O’Neal lingers in a corner, hidden in the shadows.
FRED
The Illinois Black Panther Party
has a mandate to feed every hungry
kid in Chicago. And I’m not
talking ‘bout handing out turkeys
on Thanksgiving. That’s charity.
Save that for the pushers and the
preachers who call themselves
doing you a favor after they done
sucked you dry. Fuck charity.
The Black Panther Party believes
in progression. Now what that
mean? That means first you have
free breakfast, then you have free
healthcare, then you have free
education, and next thing you
know, you look up and you done
freed your motherfucking self!

*

There’s laughter and “right on’s” among the group as Fred
continues. FOCUS ON: O’Neal, who observes ROD COLLINS
(17) whispering to a young man in a green beret who eyes
Fred menacingly. The teen takes off his T-shirt and
starts gathering pool balls in it. O’Neal’s eyes widen.
Collins intones -COLLINS
You know where you at,
motherfucker? This is Crowns
territory.
FRED
We don’t want no trouble, brother.

O’Neal watches the teen with the pool ball-stuffed Tshirt gesture to another man, also in a green beret, who
flips his pool cue around, weaponizing it. They creep
towards Fred. O’Neal grabs a pool stick and moves
quickly.
COLLINS
Nigga, don’t lecture me on
politics. The Crowns protected
Martin Luther King when he was
here in 1966.

FRED
And he got his head split open!
Damn near killed by a mob of

Just then, the teens make their move to strike but O'Neal
pushes Fred aside and, swinging his pool stick wildly,
creates a perimeter.

O’NEAL
Hey! Hey! Get the fuck back!

Collins pulls a pistol from his waistband and trains it
at O’Neal. Everyone freezes.
FRED

No need for that, brother. We on

Y’know, I investigated the

A couple kids. Trying to register
Negroes to vote, that’s all they
were doing. Got arrested on bogus
speeding charges by the sheriff’s
deputy, who hand-delivered them to
the Klan. They shot ‘em, of
course. Cut off Chaney’s penis.
This? What you and I are doing is
the other side of that coin. Don’t
let Hampton fool you. The
Panthers and the Klan are one and
the same. Their aim is to sow
hatred and inspire terror. Plain
and simple. Now, I’m all for civil

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Awaiting the Panthers in the dark church vestibule are
ten Crowns, wielding rifles and pistols. Collins and a
cluster of Crowns lead the Panthers up a darkened
staircase. They’re trailed by more armed Crowns. The
lights are off and it’s hard to see, only adding to the
Panthers’ sense of discomfort.
They reach the MAIN FLOOR and approach a lone figure
sitting on the edge of a raised stage, STEEL (19). He
loads a machine gun, while smoking a cigarette. The
Crowns who led the Panthers upstairs take the front of
the room with Steel, including Collins and... Tex! The
Crown who almost cut O’Neal’s throat! O’Neal doesn’t
notice, focused not just on Steel’s machine gun, but the
other machine gun wielding Stones populating the balcony
above them.

We’re all in the same bed, in the

oppression, economic exploitation,
and social degradation. All of our
brothers the same enemy. The

Sometimes, when a person’s house
is on fire and the person to whom
the house belongs is asleep, if
someone comes in yelling fire,
instead of the person to whom the
house belongs being thankful, they
make the mistake of charging the
one who awakened him with having
set the fire.

Respectfully, Director Hoover, why
are we talking about my daughter?

HOOVER
You killed in Korea.
MITCHELL

HOOVER
Not for country. Maybe that’s why
you enlisted. But you killed for
survival. You would have done
anything to get back home safe to
your family, wouldn’t you? Of
course. Think of your family now,
Agent Mitchell. When you look at
Hampton, think of Samantha because
that’s what’s at stake if we lose
this war. Our entire way of life.
Rape, pillage, conquer, do you

Yes.

OCTOBER, 1969

Fred exits a massive castle-like prison. Deborah awaits
in the parking lot. The pair embrace. Deborah whispers
something in his ear. Fred’s eyes grow wide. He steps
back and peers down at her belly. She opens her sweater,
revealing a slight bump and looks up at Fred with a
hopeful smile. He laughs in disbelief. The gravity of
the moment only amplifies his happiness.
FRED
You look beautiful, you know that?

*

He kisses her tenderly, then takes her by the hand and
leads her to O’Neal’s idling CAR.
O’NEAL
Woo! You all save that shit ‘til
you get back to the house.
They climb in the backseat. Fred greets O’Neal and Rush
with warm hands on their shoulders.

INT. PEOPLE’S CHURCH - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
Fred’s largest, most diverse audience yet. They clap and
stomp, chanting his name. In addition to the Young
Patriots, there are a significant number of white people
present, including Mitchell in a disguise of sorts: bellbottomed jeans, a turtleneck, and longshoreman’s cap.
Fred emerges from the church’s rear and strides down the
aisle to thunderous applause. Flanking him in the front
and rear are O’Neal and members of the security cadre.
They stand below the stage, a stoic contrast to the
frenzied crowd. Hanging behind them is a banner that
reads “WELCOME HOME CHAIRMAN FRED!“ Deborah looks on
near the front row.

Most of the audience members raise their fists in the

at the same blonde white girl he eyed before, her fist
raised enthusiastically.
Fist in the sky, O’Neal nods vigorously with every
proclamation Fred makes. Something is happening to him
in this moment. Something unexpected and jarring. Maybe
it’s Palmer’s death, or the experience of rebuilding
headquarters, or Fred putting an arm around him earlier.
But for the first time, the Chairman’s words are
penetrating O’Neal’s cold soul.
FRED
Jimmy Palmer died a revolutionary
death! He stood face-to-face and
toe-to-toe with pig Daley’s

sacrifice one can ever make!

O’Neal zeros in on the few audience members whose fists
aren’t in the air. He locks eyes with Mitchell. His jaw
almost hits the floor. His handler is in this very

ideological conversion.

Fred lunges for O’Neal again, but again Rush holds him
back.

O’Neal slams his trunk and climbs in his car as the
Panthers escort Fred back towards the apartment. He

INT. FRED AND DEBORAH'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM CONTINUOUS ACTION

A108

Deborah enters in her nightgown, rubbing the sleep from
her eyes. Fred sits at the dining room table, several
open boxes of old newspapers and magazines at his feet.
He stares at a clipping in his hands, absorbed in his
thoughts. Deborah startles him.

DEBORAH
What you doing?

Going through old shit.

My mom used to babysit him,
y’know... Not all the time but
his family lived across the street
so every now and then she’d watch
him. We didn’t go to the funeral.
It was too much for her. I don’t
even think I saw the photo ‘til
months later. But I remember when
I did, thinking, ‘There’s people
in this world that want to do that
to me. Or my brother? Or my
sister?’ That’s when I knew I had
to protect them. Looking at that
photo, how could you not feel that
way? Now here I am. About to go
to Menard. Where I won’t be able
to protect anybody... Not even my
own son.

Mitchell eats a bloody steak. He looks up to see O’Neal,
dressed in a suit, turtleneck, and sunglasses ensemble,
strolling into the restaurant.
Mitchell regards this latest incarnation of O’Neal with a
cynical smirk.
O’NEAL

INT. SWANKY BAR - NIGHT
The place is dead. WAYNE, 50s/60s, who clocked O’Neal in
the bar earlier, sits near the entrance flirting with
DARLENE, forties, black, a chain-smoking alcoholic but
she’ll catch you slipping before you catch her.
WAYNE
They name all these ships like

Darlene emits a raspy CACKLE before polishing off her gin

She departs.

SHOTGUN at the foot of the mattress. SERGEANT BLART

TOMMY GUN FIRES CEASELESSLY at the south wall, inches
above Harris, COVERING HER WITH DRYWALL.
AS HE SPRINTS DOWN THE HALLWAY, Compton observes a gun

BEDROOM as Officer Maroney (who previously hit Harmon
with a flashlight) and his team pour in, firing at Fred’s
bedroom from the other direction.

MITCHELL
(after a moment)
So... Where are things with the
party? Any news?

*

O’Neal looks up at Mitchell in disbelief.
O’NEAL
...Fred’s dead, man. I ain’t no
Goddamn Panther no more.

Mitchell takes a sip of his drink.
MITCHELL
(not asking)
You sure about that?
O’Neal considers the envelope in his hand as he
contemplates Mitchell’s query... then he puts it in his
pocket.

INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
What would you tell your son about
what you did then?
O’NEAL (V.O.)
I think I’ll let your documentary
put a cap on that story. I don’t
know. I don’t know what I’d tell
him other than I was part of the
struggle. That’s the bottom line.
I wasn’t one of those armchair
revolutionaries. One of those
people that want to sit back now
and judge the actions or inactions
of people when they sat back on
the sideline and did nothing. At
least I had a point of view. I was
dedicated. And then I had the
courage to get out there and put
it on the line. And I did.

In 1970, the survivors of the raid along with Hampton and
Clark’s mothers filed a $47.7 million lawsuit alleging a
conspiracy among the FBI, Chicago Police Department, and
State’s Attorney’s Office to assassinate Fred Hampton.

After 12 years of fighting for justice, the case was
settled for $1.85 million, at the time the longest civil
trial in US history.

FRED (PRE-LAP)
We always say in the Black Panther

want to us. We might not be back,
I might be in jail, I might be
anywhere, but when I leave you
remember I said, the last words on
my lips were, “I am.”
