Music. Title sequence:
Archival black and white photos of Empire -- One of America’s
longest running mine and company towns in the Black Rock
desert of Northern Nevada.
The factory. Workers. Meetings in board rooms. White piles of
gypsum against black mountains.
Families playing at the pool. People leaving church. Grand
opening of a grocery store. Faces smiling. Children playing
in the yard of a grammar school. A community flourishing.
Proud townsfolk posing outside the factory. Young lovers
getting married. A man mowing his lawn. A young woman
standing in front of her house, looking at the camera.
She is FERN.
Title sequence ends.
The sound of heavy wind...
EXT. EMPIRE - STORAGE - EVENING
The metal storage door rises, revealing Fern, now in her
sixties, and the snowy landscape behind her.
She digs through dusty boxes and trunks, scanning for lucky
items to bring with her. A stack of plates with autumn leaf
patterns and a rusty camping lamp make the cut.
She loads them into “Vanguard”, a white Ford cargo van, rusty
and muddy, parked in the snow.
Fern keeps searching when she pulls out a man’s blue work
coat that’s too big for her. She holds it to her face like an
old friend and breathes it in. Holding back tears.
Later, she pays storage fee to GAY, seventies, the storage
owner and an old-timer. They give each other a hug.
GAY
You take care of yourself out
there.
EXT. ROAD - NORTHERN NEVADA - EVENING
Vanguard travels across an endless, frostbitten landscape.

2.
EXT. ROAD SIDE - LATER
Fern, shivering, squats at the side of the icy road,
urinating, while looking for incoming cars.
INT. ROAD - NORTHERN NEVADA - DUSK
Highway stretches out under a dark and cloudy sky.
Fern drives, gently singing a Christmas carol.
FERN
(Singing)
What Child is this who, laid to
rest/ On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom Angels greet with anthems
sweet/ While shepherds watch are
keeping?
EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - OFFICE - SAME NIGHT
Vanguard pulls up in front of a small building covered in
snow and icicles. A large sign reads ‘DESERT ROSE’.
INT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - OFFICE - NIGHT
PATTY, a chatty manager in her sixties, looks for Fern’s
reservation. A little nervous, Fern waits.
PATTY
No. I don’t see your reservation.
FERN
Are you sure? I’m on the Amazon
CamperForce list.
PATTY
Ooooh, Amazon. I see. Hold on.
Try McD...

FERN

PATTY
There you are!
Fern is relived. It’s been a long night.

3.
EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - NIGHT
Vanguard pulls into a spot. The engine rattles to a
standstill and the lights turn off.
INT. VANGUARD - MOMENTS LATER
Fern closes the curtain dividing the drivers seat and the
back of the van. She turns on a small desk lamp and reveals
the warm and cozy DIY interior -- her home on wheels.
A pot of mac and cheese bubbles on a portable stove. Fern
adds a can of stewed tomato and seasons it.
She pours it onto the “autumn leaf” plate she brought from
storage and eats, staring blankly out of the dark window.
She does dishes with a spray bottle and carefully wipes every
one clean and stores them away.
She uses her five gallon bucket and cat litter for a pee.
She goes to bed. A red Santa light glows beside her.
EXT.

AMAZON WAREHOUSE - NEXT MORNING

The giant Amazon sign looms above.
Fern approaches briskly in the morning chill.
INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - SECURITY LINE - MORNING
Fern lines up with SEASONAL WORKERS. Faces of all types, some
tired and others excited.
Fern sees a someone she knows - AL, a man in his fifties. She
nods and he nods back.
AL
Seems like more every year.
INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - DAY
The sound in the massive factory is bone rattling.
Futuristic looking machineries and the shelves stretching all
the way to the towering ceiling.
Fern marches down long corridors, pushing a “stower” cart.

4.
She talks to herself as she matches items and packs boxes.
She works with LINDA MAY, sixty-five with long gray hair,
wearing an orange blazer that reads “Ambassador, Ask Me.”
Linda is warm and helpful. The kind of friend you want to
have on the road.
EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - BACK - DAY
The towering warehouse stands alone in the open desert. Large
delivery trucks are lined up against the building.
Fern lights a cigarette and hands Linda May one.
I quit.
What?!

LINDA MAY
FERN

LINDA MAY
I know. Forty-three years. Wasn’t
as hard as I thought.
FERN
I salute you, Linda May.
LINDA MAY
Well, I had to. Doctor said I have
macular degeneration in my right
eye.
Oh shit.

FERN

LINDA MAY
Could’ve been worse.
FERN
What can you do?
LINDA MAY
Eat healthier, exercise. Definitely
no smoking.
Fern quickly puts her cigarette out.
LINDA MAY (CONT'D)
Oh, I was enjoying that.

5.
FERN
(fans the air)
No, no.
LINDA MAY
I think I found land, Fern.
FERN
Really?! Where?
LINDA MAY
Douglas, Arizona. Right on the
Mexico border. It’s four acres in
the desert. And I just put down the
deposit.
Nice!

FERN

LINDA MAY
Yeah. Real nice. Well, I haven’t
actually seen the land in person
but the pictures on Craigslist
looked real nice.
FERN
(worried)
Linda May!
LINDA MAY
Fern! I’m taking a leap of faith!
It’s now or never!
FERN
(thinking)
Valid point. The other day I looked
in the mirror and I saw my mother.
LINDA MAY
(laughs)
Exactly. I look into the mirror and
I see my grandmother.
EXT.

DESERT ROSE RV PARK - LATER

Fern walks down a muddy path carrying oversized laundry.
INT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - LAUNDRY - SAME EVENING
Fern and Linda May share a box of detergent.
They get competitive doing a jigsaw puzzle while waiting.

6.
I/E. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - VANGUARD - SAME EVENING
Fern shows off Vanguard to Linda May who is folding laundry.
FERN
I put these drawers under the bed.
They pull out from both sides. Now
I can get my stuff from inside and
outside.
LINDA MAY
Very smart. Where’s your bucket?
And the carbon detector? Mr. Buddy
heater?
FERN
Here. Here. And my bucket and cat
litter is right here. I made a
curtain to cover it.
LINDA MAY
I should do that. I have to hurry
and hide my bucket whenever people
are visiting.
FERN
Oh, look. This is my husband’s old
fishing box. I made a little
stopper and when it opens...
(opens it)
It becomes a surface to work on.
LINDA MAY
Counter space is everything.
FERN
(takes out the dishes)
And I got my nice dishes that my
Dad gave me. He collected these
from yard sales and when I
graduated from high school he gave
me the whole set.
Beautiful.

LINDA MAY

FERN
It’s called “autumn leaf”. I don’t
have that many pieces left though.
LINDA MAY
Have you named your van yet?

7.

Vanguard.

FERN

LINDA MAY
Ooooh. That’s strong.
She is.

FERN

INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - DAYS LATER
Fern works, taking her job so seriously it’s almost comical.
EXT. FERNLEY - EVENING
Snow is falling. Time has passed. Fern drives.
INT. SPORTS STORE - LATER
Christmas music plays through the store speakers. Fern is
passed out on a weightlifting bench. Her foot slips. She
almost falls and wakes up.
Fern! Hi!

VOICE

Fern quickly gets up and sees BRANDY, mid-forties, walks over
with a full shopping cart. Her young daughters AUDREY and
MACKENZIE trail behind her.
FERN
Hi... Hi Brandy.
BRANDY
Hey girls. It’s Mrs. M!
DAUGHTERS
Hi, Mrs. M.
Fern and Brandy hug.
BRANDY
How have you been?
FERN
Good. Real good.
BRANDY
You’re working at Amazon again?

8.

Yep.

FERN

BRANDY
How is it? You like it?
FERN
Yes. Great money.
BRANDY
You still doing the... van thing?
FERN
Yes. I’m parked at Desert Rose RV
Park.
BRANDY
We just drove by there today.
Didn’t we, girls -- ?
FERN
How’s your mom?
BRANDY
Good. Real good. She misses you.
You know...
(leans in, quietly)
You can stay with us. I mean at
least while you’re working around
here. We’re worried about you.
FERN
Don’t worry about me. I’m fine.
Thank you.
BRANDY
OK... You let us know if you change
your mind, yeah?
FERN
I promise. Merry Christmas.
BRANDY
Merry Christmas, Fern. Take care!
They hug again. Brandy walks away with Audrey, while
Mackenzie lingers.
MACKENZIE
Hey, Mrs. M... we went to Burning
Man for field trip this year.
Finally!

FERN

9.
MACKENZIE
Right?! Well, we went before it
started. They gave us ice cream and
we got to write our names and a
message on a piece of wood, and
they put the wood on top of that
big temple thing they built and
then they burn it on the last day.
FERN
Nice. What did you write on yours?
MACKENZIE
I wrote that I wish we still lived
in Empire and all my friends that
moved away are all moving back.
Fern smiles at Mackenzie’s innocent hopefulness.
FERN
You like your new school?
It’s OK.

MACKENZIE

FERN
I bet you’re still the smartest
kid.
MACKENZIE
Yeh, kinda.
FERN
You remember anything we worked on
when I tutored you?
MACKENZIE
Uh, yes...
(thinking hard)
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow/ And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools/ The way to
dusty death/ Out, out, brief
candle!
Moved, Fern shakes Mackenzie’s hand.
FERN
That’s really good. Thank you.
MACKENZIE
My mom said you’re homeless. Is
that true?

10.
Fern is caught off guard, but quickly recovers.
FERN
No... I’m not homeless. I’m just...
houseless. Not the same thing,
right?
No.

MACKENZIE

FERN
It’s nice to see you, Mackenzie.
MACKENZIE
Yeah. Ok. Bye, Mrs. M.
Fern watches Mackenzie walking back to her family. She
finally relaxes from the encounter.
EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - SQUEEZE INN - NIGHT
Linda May’s home -- a small, pale-yellow, 10-foot-long
fiberglass trailer she calls the ‘Squeeze Inn’.
She has neatly decorated her “front yard” with Christmas
lights and plastic pink flamingos that glows in the dark.
INT. SQUEEZE INN - SAME
The space is cramped but homey -- Colorful fabrics. Pink and
blue donut shaped pillows. Red plastic flowers hanging from
the ceiling. Pictures and postcards on the fridge door.
Fern knits, listening intently as Linda recounts the events
that lead her to a life on the road.
LINDA MAY
Before I moved into Squeeze Inn, I
lived in a 30 FT trailer. This was
2008. The money was running out and
I was getting behind on paying for
the trailer and the rent on the
land and I still had no water or
electricity... I couldn’t find
work. I was... I’ve never been
suicidal. But, I had some liquor in
my trailer. I just thought, oh I
will just drink all this booze,
turn on the gas and pass out, and
if I come to, I will light a
cigarette and blow us all up.
(MORE)

11.
LINDA MAY (CONT'D)
Then I looked at my two little
trusting dogs, my cocker spaniel
and little toy poodle and I just
couldn’t do that to them and then I
thought... well, I couldn’t do that
to me either!
Fern shakes her head, eyes wide.
LINDA MAY (CONT'D)
I was getting close to sixty-two at
the time and I went online to look
at my social security benefit. It
said five hundred and fifty
dollars. Fern, I worked my whole
life. I worked since I was twelve
years old. Raised two daughters.
Now I’ve only got five hundred and
fifty dollars a month to live with.
I couldn’t believe it. That’s when
I heard about Bob Wells and Cheap
RV Living. On his website, he has
two budgets laid out. One for 500 a
month and one for 1000. I could
live in an RV, travel and not have
to work for the rest of my life.
Later, the small space is steamed up with Linda May’s
cooking. Fern sips on hot cider, watching a youtube video of
Bob Wells. He wears glasses and has long white hair.
BOB WELLS ON SCREEN
The RTR is a bootcamp for beginner
nomads. Once a year, we come
together as a tribe -FERN
(looks up)
Bob Wells looks just like Santa
Claus.
LINDA MAY
Everyone says that.
FERN
What does RTR stand for?
LINDA MAY
Rubber Tramp Rendezvous. It’s in
Quartzsite, Arizona, in the desert
on BLM land. I’ll draw you a map.
You won’t have reception out there.

12.
FERN
I don’t think I will go.
LINDA MAY
You should! The “Big Tent” is
happening in town at the same time.
It’s a RV show, biggest in the
country. You can sign up for jobs.
FERN
What kind of jobs?
LINDA MAY
Seasonal. All kinds. Camp hosting
for National Parks, Adventureland,
working concessions at spring
training games in Texas, beet
harvest in Nebraska.
FERN
Beet harvest.
LINDA MAY
Not the small red ones. The big
white sugar beets. I’ve done it
twice now.
FERN
Um... No... I’m gonna stay around
here. I know the area.
LINDA MAY
I’ll draw you a map anyway.
INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - WEEKS LATER
Everyone works double-speed during holiday shopping season.
The warehouse begins to look bigger and the workers smaller.
EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - NIGHT A WEEK LATER
Fern smokes alone. DOUG, a coworker, walks by shivering.
DOUG
Happy holidays Fern. See you next
year.
FERN
You too, Doug.

13.
INT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - VANGUARD - NEW YEAR EVE
The blue flame of a Mr. Buddy heater glows in the corner. The
sound of fireworks in the distance.
Fern makes a treat for herself -- bread with hot milk and
sugar. She adjusts her Happy New Year headband.
2012, another year arrives.
EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - VANGUARD - MORNING A WEEK LATER
Fern cleans thick snow off of Vanguard when she sees a DOG
sniffing near her things.
INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
PATTY
Carl had a stroke!
FERN
Is he dead?
PATTY
No! No. But his daughter took him
back east.
FERN
They didn’t take the dog?!
PATTY
They didn’t take the dog. Do you
want to keep him? His name is
Scout.
FERN
No. I can’t. I don’t have space.
PATTY
He’s a good guard dog. You know...
it’s not safe for a woman to be out
there all alone.
FERN
I’ve got nothing people want.
PATTY
Oooh... I’m sorry.
(beat)
You’re checking out tomorrow right?

14.
FERN
Yeah... I finished at Amazon last
week. How much is it now?
PATTY
Let’s see, Amazon paid for your
parking spot until this Thursday.
Afterwards, it’s thirty-three a
night and nine-fifty a month.
FERN
What about a discount if I don’t
use the electrical and dump? I just
got my van.
PATTY
No sorry. We’re set up for RVs. If
you live in a van, why not just go
somewhere warmer?
FERN
I’m trying to find a job around
here.
PATTY
Oh. Ok. Good luck with that.
FERN
Aright, Patty. Bye.
PATTY
So long, Fern. See you next year.
Fern steps out into the cold roar of traffic outside. Scout
still waits. Fern pets him awkwardly and goes on her way.
INT. FALLON - JOB CENTER - DAY
Fern sits at a desk opposite a JOB CENTER RECRUITER and puts
on her best smile.
FERN
I went to college. I studied
English and Theater. I have skills
in the service industry. I was a
waiter while I was in school. I
also have secretarial skills. One
summer I answered fan letters for
ACDC. My husband worked at the USG
Empire mine and I worked for their
HR department for a few years, then
I stopped working because of... an
illness in the family.

15.
RECRUITER
Didn’t the Empire mine shut down?
FERN
Yeah. Last year. We all moved out.
Before the recruiter can say anything, Fern continues.
FERN (CONT'D)
I also did a lot of part time jobs.
I tutored, I cashiered at the
Empire store and I also worked at
the Black Rock Information Center
in Gerlach during Burning Man every
year. Have you been to Burning Man?
RECRUITER
No, but my son goes every year -FERN
Ah! So you know, people have all
kinds of questions. I took care of
it all. I just worked at Amazon
during the holidays. I’m also very
handy and I have my own tools.
RECRUITER
That’s... all very good. But you’re
not specialized in anything?
A moment. Fern shakes her head.
RECRUITER (CONT'D)
Have you looked into early
retirement?
FERN
I don’t want to retire! I... don’t
think I can get by on the benefits
anyway. I need work. I like work.
RECRUITER
I understand but the jobs we have
require special trainings, and
frankly they won’t be available
until the weather gets better.
EXT. FOX PEAK GAS STATION - NIGHT
Blizzard at night fall. Vanguard pulls into the gas station.

16.
EXT. FOX PEAK GAS STATION - VANGUARD - LATER
Fern is wearing two hats and gloves as she shakes off a rug.
RACHEL, the gas station manager, approaches.
RACHEL
Hello, ma’am. I’m Rachel, I’m the
manager here at Fox Peak -FERN
-- I asked and someone told me I
can park here overnight.
RACHEL
Yes, you’re fine. But you know the
temperature’s gonna drop. It gets
really cold at night. Real cold.
FERN
I have a really good sleeping bag.
RACHEL
I don’t want to overstep my
boundaries here, but there is a
church down by Seven-Eleven. A
Baptist church and they do have
open bed -FERN
I’m gonna be good! Thank you.
INT. FOX PEAK GAS STATION - VANGUARD - SAME NIGHT
Fern wraps herself in layers of blankets and sleeping bags.
She shivers hard, unable to get warm.
EXT. FOX PEAK GAS STATION - NEXT MORNING
The ground is frozen. Fern smokes by vanguard.
Lights start to turn on in the suburban homes beyond the
highway. A freight train rattles across.
It’s time to move on.
INT. VANGUARD ON HIGHWAY - DAWN
Headlights illuminate the dark road ahead.

17.
Fern drives. Ahead of her, the first light of dawn
illuminates a new landscape.
EXT. ROAD IN DESERT - MORNING
Vanguard heads south on the warm low desert drenched in sun.
It passes sleepy towns, corky billboards and hitchhikers.
EXT. QUARTZSITE, ARIZONA - EVENING
Fern drives through the bustling town of Quartzsite -- a
strange and wild oasis in the desert.
ELDERLY RETIREES, DREADLOCKED TEENS, MOTORCYCLE GANGS, ROCK
HUNTERS, TOURISTS. Cars and trucks towing all kinds of
shelters. Mostly dusty. Traffic crawls. No one is in a hurry.
I/E. VANGUARD ON UNPAVED ROAD IN THE DESERT - EVENING
Vanguard travels on a bumpy road towards the middle of
nowhere.
Fern looks at a hand-drawn map, unsure until she spots a
yellow DIY sign in the distance that reads ‘RTR’.
She goes further, finds another sign, and makes a sharp turn
deeper into the desert.
EXT. RTR - EVENING
Fern spots a cluster of 50 vehicles in the distance. Mostly
vans, old trailers, campers, some tents and a school bus.
She parks and climbs out of Vanguard, pulling on the
oversized blue work jacket she took out of the storage.
She finds Linda May in A GROUP OF NOMADS. Linda is so happy
to see Fern. She points at the MAN speaking in the front.
LINDA MAY
That’s Bob Wells.
Bob has a deep voice and speaks with confidence.
BOB WELLS
We not only accept the tyranny of
the dollar. We embrace it. We
gladly live by it our whole lives.
I think of the analogy as like a
work horse.
(MORE)

18.
BOB WELLS (CONT'D)
The work horse that is willing to
work itself to death and then be
put out to pasture. That’s what
happened to so many of us in 2008.
If society is throwing us away and
putting us out to pasture, we work
horses have to gather together and
take care of each other, and that
is what this is all about.
Fern smiles. She’s in the right place.
BOB WELLS (CONT'D)
The way I see it -- The Titanic is
sinking and economic times are
changing. My goal is to get the
life boats out and get as many
people into the lifeboats as I can.
EXT. RTR - DUSK
Steaming hot chili is served and shared with all from two
large pots, similar to the old-fashioned hobo stew.
Fern and Linda May wait eagerly in line.
Fern is offered some vegan stew by DAVE, sixties, kind eyes.
FERN
What’s that?
DAVE
This is vegan.
FERN
No thanks, I’m a carnivore.
SWANKIE, seventies, wades forward, hungry and eager for her
serving. She is sharp and energetic, with one arm in a sling.
SWANKIE
I’m a carnivore too!
EXT. RTR - CAMPFIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Logs glow on the fire. A small group of nomads gather and
share their stories of what lead to a life on the road.
BRYCE, sixties, a stern face, holds a small dog.

19.
BRYCE
I’m a Vietnam vet and I got PTSD. I
really can’t handle loud noises,
big crowds, fireworks. Bob helped
me. I got a pickup truck and
camper. I can live out here. And be
at peace.
DENI, fifties, wearing a red beanie and feather earrings.
DENI
I had finally convinced my grandpa,
my poppa and my momma that we
should take off in an RV and see
the country. But then both of them
were told they had cancer and they
died three weeks apart. I began
watching Bob Wells videos on van
dwelling. Then I bought my van
Paint, because ‘she takes me where
I ain’t’. And started my healing
journey two years ago.
MERLE, sixties, blue eyes glistening in the fire light.
MERLE
I worked for corporate America for
twenty years. My friend Bill worked
for the same company and he had
liver failure. A week before he was
about to retire, HR called him, in
hospice, and said ‘let’s talk about
your retirement!’ He died ten days
later... having never taken that
sailboat he bought out of his
driveway. He missed out on
everything. He told me before he
died ‘just don’t waste any time,
Merle. Don’t waste any time.’ So I
retired as soon as I could. I
didn’t want my sailboat to be in my
driveway when I died.
(beat)
And it’s not. My sailboat is out
here in the desert.
EXT. RTR - CAMP - DAWN
Saguaro cactus silhouetted against the Arizona morning sky.
Bob Wells and Fern sit on the edge of the camp talking.

20.
BOB WELLS
I can’t imagine what you’re going
through. The loss of your husband.
The loss of your whole town and
friends. That kind of loss is never
easy.
Fern forces a smile.
BOB WELLS (CONT'D)
I wish I had an easy answer for
you, but I think you’ve come to the
right place to find an answer. I
think that connecting to nature and
to a real true community and tribe
will make a difference for you.
(beat)
I hope so.
EXT. RTR - CAMP - LATER
Fern takes a long walk through the camp. People going
through their morning routines, cleaning, washing, cooking, a
few gathered by the bonfire.
LINDA MAY
Hey Fern! Come join us.
FERN
No. I’m just gonna take a little
walk. Be right back.
Fern watches as OLD-TIMERS help a NEWCOMER installing his
solar panels. A MAN is giving free hair cuts. A SMALL GROUP
is doing Tai-Chi together. A ROLL OF ATV speed by.
EXT. RTR - MAIN CAMP - MORNING
Bob Wells teaches in front of a crowd. Fern takes notes.
BOB WELLS
A lot of folks ask me: ‘Bob, I want
to live this lifestyle, but I work
in the city. What do I do about the
dreaded ‘knock on the door’. So I
created what I call the Ten
Commandments of Stealth Parking.
FOREST, a younger man, teaches an “All About Tires” seminar.
Fern is trying to plug a tire.

21.
FOREST
That’s it. You gotta make the hole
bigger.
The WOMEN in the audience laugh delightedly at accidental
innuendos. Fern blushes.
SUANNE, sixties, funny, enthusiastically teaches hygiene on
the road.
SUANNE
I love this lifestyle. Freedom,
beauty and connection with the
earth. But there is a tradeoff -you gotta learn to take care of
your own shit!
Everyone laughs. Suanne takes out a stack of three buckets.
SUANNA
(displays a medium bucket)
Most of us use a five-gallon
bucket. Most of us are in vans or
something larger. I’m in a Prius...
(displays a small bucket)
So I use a two-gallon bucket. And
If you have bad knees...
(displays a large bucket)
You can use a seven-gallon bucket!
Look, it’s like Goldilocks and the
Three Bears!
EXT. RTR - CAMP - FREE PILE - NEXT MORNING
The ‘Free Pile’ -- a blue tarp cluttered with various items.
People take what they need and leave what they don’t.
Fern tries to decide between a blue or red can opener.
DAVE
(leans over)
You should take this one. That
one’s kinda funky.
FERN
These yours?
DAVE
Yep. There’s a black hole in every
van. One time I had seven of these
can openers.
Fern considers Dave’s observations.

22.
FERN
Doesn’t happen to me.
Really.

DAVE

FERN
I know exactly where everything is.
Fern hands Dave one of the pot holders she made.
FERN (CONT'D)
Trade you for a pot holder. I make
them.
DAVE
Thanks. First year?
Yep. You?

FERN

DAVE
Been coming here every year. I’m
what you would call a ‘FOB’ -Friend of Bob’s. You read his book?
FERN
It’s my bible.
(picks up a tray)
Nice.
DAVE
(pretends to reach for it)
It is nice.
FERN
(laughs)
No, no. It’s coming home with me.
(walks away)
See ya.
DAVE
(waves)
See you around.
EXT. QUARTZSITE - RV SHOW - NEXT DAY
The largest RV show in the country. Hundreds of venders, RV
displays, seasonal job recruiters, food stalls.
Fern, Linda May and Swankie munch on corn dogs and sign up
for seasonal jobs. The ladies are having a great time.

23.
EXT. RV SHOW - LATER
They walk by a lot full of luxurious RVs, towering over them.
SWANKIE
They are HUGE!
FERN
Like dinosaurs.
LINDA MAY
Do you know how much money is
sitting right here?
INT. GIANT RV - SAME
Wide eyed, they enter a brightly-lit fancy RV. They look in
wonder at the leather sofas, marble kitchen counter, polished
wood cabinets and flat-screen TVs. Fern opens a cupboards.
FERN
Washer and dryer!
LINDA MAY
Now that’s real nice.
EXT. RTR - NIGHT
Fern signs her name on a small “van” made of cardboard boxes,
covered with signatures and messages.
The van is burned in a bonfire while the tribe of nomads
gather with food and drinks and sing their version of “On the
Road Again” -- “Burn the Van again”.
NOMADS
In our vans again / Just can't wait
to get in our vans again / The life
we love is in the desert with our
friends / And we can't wait to get
in our vans again.
In our vans again / Goin places
most haven't been / Goin places we
may never go again/ And we can't
wait to get in our vans again.
Rubber tramps again / Like a band
of gypsies we go down to Quartzsite
We'll see Bob again / We'll share
our tales at campfires in the night
time / Warm fire time
(MORE)

24.
NOMADS (CONT'D)
Burn that van again / Just can't
wait to burn up that van again / It
marks the end of our stay here in
Quartzsite town / But next year
we'll be coming back again / And we
can't wait to get in our vans again
INT. QUARTZSITE YACHT CLUB - SAME NIGHT
Colorful disco lights flicker across smiling faces. The
SINGER in a cowboy hat plays on a small stage in the corner.
Fern, Linda May, Swankie and more WOMEN line dance together.
Fern is drunk and having a great time.
Later. Dave approaches Fern when she is sitting alone. He
asks her to dance. She hesitates but accepts.
They dance to an old cowboy song.
EXT. RTR - NEXT MORNING
The RTR has come to an end. Fern walks passed a line of vans
and RVs pulling out of the campsite, like an old fashioned
wagon train, heading on to greener pastures.
She waves, sad to see them go.
EXT. DESERT - VANGUARD - MORNING A MONTH LATER
The desert is empty now. And it’s getting hot.
Vanguard is parked by a cluster of cactus. Music rattles from
a radio. Laundry drying on the line.
Fern finishes screwing a new panel to the back door,
impressed by her handy work.
She looks to the distance -- Swankie, the only other camper
in miles, is hoisting a pirate flag up by her van.
INT. LAUNDROMAT AND MALL - DAY
Fern reads while waiting for her laundry.
She inspects the bulletin board for local jobs. She tears off
a contact number.

25.
EXT.

QUARTZSITE - TROCK - DAYS LATER

Fern is at her new job, dragging a small cart in a sea of
gems and rocks, sorting, cleaning and stashing them.
NOODLE and ROXY, two travelers in their early twenties, are
trying to sell the jewelry they made.
FERN
Hey Ron! Can you come here for a
second? These guys have some really
nice stuff.
RON, skin like an iguana, emerges from his office/RV.
FERN (CONT'D)
This is Noodle, Roxy. This is Ron.
NOODLE
Hey Ron. Just trying to make some
gas money.
RON
Not sure we need new products -FERN
Yeah, but these are much nicer than
what we have going on here. Look at
the details. Look, Ron, look!
Fern holds one up to her neck to demonstrate, clearly trying
to help the youngsters out.
Later, Fern takes a smoke break. She sees a colorfullypainted school bus parked in the open desert. Noodle, Roxy
and a group of YOUNG TRAVELLERS gather around a smoldering
fire with their dogs. One of them is playing the banjo.
Fern tries not to stare and looks away.
VOICE
Hello, ma’am.
Fern looks back and sees DEREK, one of the travelers in his
early twenties, approaches her. He is straight out of a Walt
Whitman novel, wearing suspenders and a misshapen cowboy hat.
DEREK
Would you by chance have an extra
cigarette?
FERN
Yeah sure. Need a light?

26.
Fern lights Derek’s cigarette and notices that his hands and
forearms are covered in tattoos. The inked words on his
knuckles read “RAIL FARE”.
FERN (CONT'D)
(offers him the lighter)
Need it?
DEREK
Why sure. Thank you. I’m Derek.
Fern.

FERN

DEREK
Fern. Well, it’s nice to meet you.
I’ll be seeing you.
Derek walks away. Fern watches him go, concerned to see those
so young out here on the road.
EXT. DESERT - NEXT MORNING
Thunder. Darkening sky. A storm is approaching.
Vanguard’s front tire is flat. Frustrated, Fern kicks it.
EXT. SWANKIE’S VAN - LATER
The pirate flag is still up. Fern hesitates and knocks on the
door. No one answers at first, she knocks again.
SWANKIE
What? I’m busy!
FERN
Sorry! Swankie, it’s Fern! Can I
talk to you?
Swankie opens the door, squinting. Eye mask on her forehead.
SWANKIE
Didn’t you see the flag? That means
do not disturb -- !
FERN
-- I know. I need a ride into town.
Why?

SWANKIE

27.
FERN
I blew my tire.
SWANKIE
You blew your tire.
Yeah.

FERN

SWANKIE
Go change it!
FERN
I don’t have a spare.
SWANKIE
You don’t have a spare.
(stares)
You’re out here in the boondocks
and you don’t have a spare?!
EXT. QUARTZSITE - GARAGE - DAY
Vanguard is being worked on by a YOUNG MECHANIC. Swankie is
lecturing Fern who tries to listen patiently.
SWANKIE
You need to take this lifestyle
seriously. This is not a holiday.
You can die out here. You know
that? You can die out here. I don’t
want you to die.
FERN
I really appreciate it, Swankie.
SWANKIE
You’re welcome. You can pay me
back.
Fern raises her eyebrows.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
See, I’m going on an important trip
and I got a lot of getting ready to
do. I can’t get things done fast
enough, with my arm. I can’t lift
it, look, hey, look.
(tries to lift her arm
dramatically)
Ouch! See? I can’t --

28.

Ok! Yes --

FERN

SWANKIE
Good. I really appreciate it.
EXT. SWANKIE'S VAN - DAY
Swankie shows Fern how to touch up the paint on her van.
SWANKIE
I’m going to leave you the rest of
my paint. You need to touch up your
van. It’s looking kinda...ratty.
FERN
What? No. She just needs a wash.
SWANKIE
Oh, she needs more than a wash.
Take my paint.
Fern looks over at Vanguard, offended.
Later, Fern is hard at work polishing the paint.
SWANKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Ha! Fern, come look at this!
Fern wipes her hand and peaks into the van.
Swankie sits at her small desk next to piles of VHS tapes.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
I’m digitizing home videos -Watch! Watch!
The old laptop display a video of her skydiving with her SON
from twenty years ago. The image is fuzzy but Fern can still
make out Swankie, laughing as she jumps out of the airplane.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
Off we go. To the blue yonder.
That’s me and my son Doug. I
surprised him for his 30th
birthday. Look! He’s gonna grab me
mid-air and kisses me!
On screen -- Two tiny figures falling through the sky
together. One gives the other a kiss.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
Ha! Did you see that!?

29.
Swankie laughs like a child watching it. Another moment
passes. She shrugs.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
I used to like him. That was before
he turned so goddamn boring.
EXT. VANGUARD - NEXT MORNING
Fern brushes her teeth, gargles and spits into a dry bush.
She inspects Vanguard. It’s more rusty than she thought.
FERN
(groans)
Ratty...
INT. VANGUARD - LATER
Fern practices playing a flute. She is out of tune.
Suddenly she’s got a bad stomach and needs the toilet. She
pulls out her five gallon bucket and does a number two.
The smell is overwhelming. Fern scrambles for toilet paper
while trying to turn on the ceiling fan...
A KNOCK on the door.
SWANKIE (O.S.)
Hello. It’s me!
FERN
What?! I’m indisposed!
EXT. SWANKIE’S VAN - MOMENTS LATER
Swankie’s stuff, everything she owns, are laid out in front
of her van and trailer.
SWANKIE
When did I buy all this crap?
FERN
(organizing)
Well, it adds up. I got mine in
storage.
SWANKIE
I hate storage. I put an ad on
Quartzsite Chatters.
(MORE)

30.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
I hope people come. I hate to throw
things away...
Fern picks up a green lawn chair and admires it.
FERN
Why are you giving everything away?
SWANKIE
You like that chair?
I love it.

FERN

SWANKIE
Take it. It’s yours. Check these
out.
Swankie shows off her rock collections.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
These are coming with me.
FERN
You found all these?
SWANKIE
Oh yeah. My eyes are always on the
ground wherever I went. This one is
fossilized pinewood. This one is
jasper from around here. This one,
the red, white and blue, is...
Swankie suddenly has a dizzy spell.
FERN
What’s wrong? Swankie?
Swankie can barely stand. Fern holds her up.
FERN (CONT'D)
Come and sit down.
Swankie sits down and holds her head in pain.
SWANKIE
My head hurts really bad and I’m
nauseated.
FERN
Here, drink.
Fern brings water and looks on with concern.

31.
INT. SWANKIE’S VAN - LATER
Swankie is sleeping on her platform bed.
Fern is digitizing the home videos for her. She watches fuzzy
footage of Swankie dressed as a carpenter’s wife working at
the Living History Museum.
Swankie wakes and pushes herself up.
FERN
Are you alright?
She coughs violently and takes a handful of pills.
I guess...

SWANKIE

FERN
(carefully)
Are you sure? Swankie?
Swankie hesitates.
FERN (CONT'D)
What’s this trip about?
SWANKIE
...I have cancer.
Fern takes a deep breath.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
I had it a while back. They removed
it from my lung. But it came back.
Small cell carcinoma. They told me
its spread to my brain and they’ve
only given me seven or eight months
to live. Something like that. I
didn’t get the lucky gene. No, sir.
FERN
I’m so sorry, Swankie.
SWANKIE
I’m gonna take my trip. Gonna go
back to Alaska. I’ve had some good
memories there kayaking. I have
this book called Final Exit by Dr.
Kevorkian, some people call him
‘Doctor Death’. It shows you
various ways to end your life if
you need to. It’s kinda like a
recipe.
(MORE)

32.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
I have it if I have to fall back on
it for some ideas, but I’m not
going to spend any more time
indoors in a hospital. No thanks.
Swankie looks down. Lost in a thought for a moment.
Fern watches her, speechless.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
I’m gonna be seventy-five this year
and I think I’ve had a pretty good
life. I’ve seen some really neat
things kayaking all over the
country... A moose family on a
river in Idaho. Big white pelicans
landing just six feet over my kayak
on a lake in Colorado. Or... coming
round a bend of a cliff and finding
hundreds and hundreds of swallow
nests on the wall of the cliff. And
the swallows flying all around,
reflecting in the water so it looks
like I’m flying with the swallows.
And little babies are hatching out.
Egg shells are falling out of the
nest and landing on the water right
next to me, these little white
shells. And... it was just so
awesome, Fern! I felt I had done
enough. My life was complete. I
felt like if I were to die right
then, it would be OK. How many
people can say that?
Fern smiles. Not many.
EXT - DESERT - EVENING
Swankie shows Fern how to rock hunt under the orange sky.
SWANKIE (V.O.)
Maybe when I die, my friends will
throw a rock in a fire in
remembrance of me.
EXT.

SWANKIE’S VAN - NEXT DAY

Fern helps PEOPLE loading up Swankie’s things into their cars
and ATVs.

33.
Swankie shows a MAN how to use her tools that he picked up.
She explain the origin of her doll collection to TWO WOMEN.
She sees A WOMAN walking away with an old music box.
SWANKIE
My grandmother gave me that. Take
good care of it.
She watches that woman driving away.
By the evening, almost everything is gone.
I/E. VANGUARD - SAME NIGHT
Fern is sleepless. She looks out through the curtains.
Swankie is getting her kayak ready under a camping lamp.
Fern closes the curtain and takes out a metal box with a few
random items and photos.
She looks through them -- Some are from her younger years:
Fern dressed up with her parents. Fern and her sister DOLLY,
smiling into camera. Fern acting in a play.
Then, a photo of Beau, her husband, in his younger years. She
traces her finger over the black and white photo.
She smiles at it. Her eyes are wet.
EXT. SWANKIE’S VAN - NEXT MORNING
A cloudy and breezy morning. Fern is shaving Swankie’s head.
Swankie sits in a chair, a towel wrapped around her neck.
FERN
Can I tell you something, Swankie?
What?

SWANKIE

FERN
I keep thinking a lot about my
husband Beau. Did I ever tell you
about him?
SWANKIE
No. Bo, like b,o?

34.
FERN
No, B,e,a,u. It’s a nickname. It
means boyfriend. My mom called him,
“your beau”, and it stuck.
Anyway... When it got real bad at
the end, they had him in the
hospital with the morphine drips. I
would sit there at night and I
would want to put my thumb down on
that morphine drip just a little
longer... so I could let him go.
Swankie considers Fern’s confession.
FERN (CONT'D)
Maybe I should’ve tried harder, you
know, so he could’ve have gone
sooner without all that pain...
SWANKIE
Maybe he didn’t want that. Maybe he
was trying to stay with you for as
long as he could.
(beat)
I’m sure you took good care of him,
Fern.
I did.

FERN

Fern smiles a little and keeps on cutting Swankie’s hair.
When it’s over, Swankie covers her now clean-shaven head with
an overly colorful floral hat.
SWANKIE
Do you like my hat? I bought it for
two dollars. You think people will
stop calling me “sir” if I wear it?
FERN
(smiles)
Maybe.
SWANKIE
One last favor?
What?

FERN

Swankie goes back into her van and comes out with a box.

35.
SWANKIE
These are all the home videos. All
digitized. I’ll give you my son’s
address and you can bring this to
him. He lives in Yuma.
FERN
Why wouldn’t you go yourself?
SWANKIE
I got no time for it.
FERN
But... What should I tell him?
SWANKIE
Nothing about any of this. I want
to be left alone. So nothing. Just
tell him it’s from me and he can do
whatever he wants with them.
Before Fern can protest, Swankie climbs into her van, the
floral hat on her head and her arm still in the sling.
SWANKIE (CONT'D)
Take care, Fern! See you down the
road!
Swankie waves and drives away.
Fern stands there for a long time, watching the white van
rattle towards the horizon.
INT.

OASIS BOOK STORE - NIGHT.

PAUL WINER, seventy five, the famed Quartzsite Naked
Bookseller, wears a top hat and sings a Boogie woogie.
Fern sits with a small local audience, listening.
PAUL WINER
Hey, hey, now how about a drink?
How about a toast to our friends?
Not the friends you see every day,
no. Instead we’re gonna drink to
the friends who had to go away. I
bet you know just who I mean -- the
friends who had to depart, the
friends in our hearts.
(Singing)
You hear the blues, in my boogie,
can you see the blood in my beer?
(MORE)

36.
PAUL WINER (CONT'D)
Just help me laugh at pain, help me
smile away the tears.
Paul hits the last note on the piano and laughs.
EXT. DESERT SUBURB - SECURITY GATE - DAY
A sprawling desert suburb development.
Vanguard pulls up to the security gate. No one is around.
EXT. DESERT SUBURB - DAY
Fern walks along the identical houses holding Swankie’s box.
She finds the right house and rings the doorbell.
EXT. DOUG’S HOUSE - SAME
DOUG, Swankie’s son, mid-forties, wearing a baseball cap,
opens the door.
Yes?

DOUG

FERN
Hi. My name’s Fern. I’m... I know
your mother, Swankie.
Ok?

DOUG

FERN
I’m just here to drop off some
things she wanted you to have.
DOUG
And, where is she?
FERN
She’s gone... to Alaska! To kayak.
DOUG
(sighs)
And, what’s in the box?
FERN
I’m not sure. Uh... Some home
videos. Digitized. One of them is
from your 30th birthday skydiving --

37.
DOUG
Just leave it there.
Fern looks down at the spot Doug is pointing, next to the
hose and muddy shoes.
There?

FERN

DOUG
Look. I don’t know what my mother
has told you. But she’ll do
anything to get out of coming to
see her family.
Doug closes the door on Fern.
Fern hesitates for a moment, then puts the box down.
As she walks away, she looks back -- a life reduced to a box
of memories discarded on a family porch.
EXT. ROADS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS - TIME PASSING
The road goes on.
Beyond the desert is the red canyons and green mountains. The
Black Hills and the Great Plains...
Fern, now in a light summer dress, walks around an abandoned
western town in South Dakota.
She drives through the dramatic rock formation in Needles
Highway and watches buffalos in Custer State Park.
She swims in the streams of Cascade Falls at dusk. Her naked
body floats in the glistening water.
At sunset, the golden outlines of the badlands pass by in the
window of Vanguard. Fern has arrived at her destination -- a
campground in the Badlands National Park.
Vanguard is parked at a spot that reads “Camp Host”. Fern
sits in Swankie’s green chair, smokes a cigarette, surrounded
by families enjoying their summer vacation.
INT. CEDER PASS CAMPGROUND - NIGHT
Large moths hover around a fluorescent bulb.
hair at the sink.

Fern cuts her

38.
EXT. VANGUARD - NEXT MORNING
Fern irons her camp host t-shirt outside her van.
She does her morning stretches, eats oatmeal, makes instant
coffee and pours it into a green thermo.
EXT. CEDER PASS CAMPGROUND - MORNING
Fern walks around the campground, excited about her new job,
offering coffee to campers.
She approaches a rusty Dodge van.
FERN
Hello! Coffee?
A man pops out from behind the van. It’s Dave, dressed in the
National Park volunteer uniform.
DAVE
Oh, Oh hi...
FERN
Hello. Coffee?
DAVE
I... know you.
FERN
Yes. I have your can opener.
DAVE
That’s right.
Dave.

FERN

DAVE
Fern. So, you’re working here?
FERN
Yup. First year. With Linda May.
You know her.
DAVE
I sure do...
...Coffee?

FERN

DAVE
Yes, yes, just...

39.
Dave quickly gets a camping mug. Fern pours him some coffee.
He drops the lid clumsily.
FERN
(hurries away)
It’s just black, so, if you want
anything else... OK, bye. I’m your
camp host!
EXT. CEDER PASS CAMPGROUND - DAY
Linda May shows Fern the ropes of camp hosting. Fern follows
Linda around while pushing a yellow mopping station.
INT. CAMPGROUND BATHROOM - DAY
The ladies clean dirty sinks and hairy shower stalls. The
toilets are the worst, but Fern is dedicated.
EXT. CEDER PASS CAMPGROUND - EVENING
Fern and Linda May drive a golf cart around, welcoming the
fun and fresh air.
They stop at a campsite to pick up trash. Fern finds a pair
of men’s underwear left behind. She picks it up and chases
Linda May with it.
VOICE
Excuse me. Are you the camp host?
Fern and Linda stop messing around and sees VICTOR, a tough
looking man walking up to them.
FERN
Yes. Yes. We are.
(puts the underwear in a
trash bag)
I’d shake your hand but you
wouldn’t want to.
VICTOR
Right. Sorry to bother you but the
power is out. I think the whole
grid is down. I’m trying to set up
for my daughter’s birthday.
Fern is at the grid station and flips all the switches.
Is it on?!

FERN

40.
VICTOR
Yup! Thank you!
Fern and Linda May join the birthday party. Linda May is
chatting with Victor’s family and making balloons for the
kids. Fern is a little awkward and eats a slice of the
rainbow colored birthday cake by herself as the sun sets.
EXT. BADLANDS NP - VISITOR CENTER - MORNING FEW DAYS LATER
Fern and Linda May walk towards the visitor center.
INT. VISITOR CENTER - DAY
Fern puts her face very close to a taxidermy rattlesnake in
the display glass case. Linda fixes her hair.
LINDA MAY
We are here for the tour.
TOUR GUIDE
Welcome! The tour is in fifteen
minutes. You can wait right here.
Here is a map...
While the tour guide explains away, Fern notices Dave behind
the counter, answering questions for TWO YOUNG FEMALE
TRAVELERS, drawing on a large map for them.
EXT. BADLANDS NP - DOOR TRAIL - EVENING
Dave guides the tour, explaining the formation of the
Badlands.
DAVE
About seventy-five million years
ago a shallow sea covered the Great
Plains region. Eventually the
continental plates shifted, causing
the land under the sea to rise and
the water to retreat. During this
time the Badlands looked nothing
like it does today...
The ‘Door Trail’ is like another planet. Fern wanders away
from the group.
She walks between colorful rocks, along dry washes, deeper
into the rock formations. She picks up sandy rocks of
different sizes and shapes and inspects them.

41.
A while later. She finds herself on low ground. She looks
around for a moment -- The trail has disappeared.
She turns around and walks back towards the direction she
came from. But soon she finds herself in the same spot.
Everything looks the same.
She starts to panic and tries to find a way to higher ground.
A LOUD whistle.
She looks up and sees Dave’s tiny figure in the far distance.
Relieved, she waves.
DAVE (CONT'D)
Found anything interesting?
Rocks!

FERN

Fern climbs back onto the trail. Before she rejoins the group
she looks back at Dave, who is still on the cliff, having a
moment on his own watching the dusky sky.
EXT. HORSESHOE BAR - WEEKS LATER
Time passed. Fern and Linda May have become friends with Dave
and GREG, the bartender of a local cowboy bar.
They take shots of tequila together.
FERN
To the Earthship!
DAVE/LINDA/GREG
To the Earthship!
Linda shows off her land on her phone’s cracked screen.
LINDA MAY
See that there? See the sand?
That’s a good sign. It’s buildable.
GREG
What’s that thing?
LINDA MAY
That’s a prickly pear. You can make
jam from it. Jelly, cactus candy.
DAVE
Wine. Got any neighbors?

42.
LINDA MAY
Closest neighbor is two miles away.
DAVE
Exactly where you want them.
Exactly.

LINDA MAY

GREG
You’re gonna build this thing
yourself?
LINDA MAY
Oh yeah. I’m been in construction
most of my life. I’ve never got to
build my own house. This Earthship
will be something I’m proud to
leave for grandchildren.
Linda and Fern exchange a smile.
LINDA MAY (CONT'D)
It’ll be there for generations.
Outlive us all.
EXT. CEDER PASS CAMPGROUND - EVENING
Linda May’s trailer is hooked up and ready to go. She and
Fern embrace for a long time.
LINDA MAY
I’m not gonna see you for a while.
I know...

FERN

LINDA MAY
You come and see me. You come and
stay as long as you like, whenever
you like.
FERN
Thank you, Linda May.
LINDA MAY
Thank you. You have given me so
much.
Linda drives away. A group of KIDS waving at her as she pulls
out of the campsite.

43.
Fern watches, it’s always bittersweet to see your friend move
on to the next chapter of their life.
The tiny yellow trailer disappears into the pale badlands.
INT. VANGUARD - NIGHT
Fern can’t sleep. She tosses and turns. She fishes for her
tobacco but it’s out.
EXT. DAVE’S VAN - MOMENTS LATER
Fern walks up to Dave’s van with a camping lamp and finds
Dave reading on his platform bed. His back doors are open.
Hi.
Hey!

FERN
DAVE

FERN
Can I bum a cigarette? I ran out.
DAVE
Oh. I don’t have any.
Really?

FERN

DAVE
I don’t really smoke. I was just
being polite at the bar. People
keep giving them to me because they
think I look like a smoker -FERN
So you don’t have any.
DAVE
Do I look like a smoker?
FERN
(walks away)
I’m going up to Wall.
DAVE
It’s too late to drive through the
park!
Yep!

FERN (O.S.)

44.
INT. FERN’S VAN IN BADLANDS - NIGHT
Fern drives through the park. The pale and sharp walls of the
badlands look more menacing at night. She hums.
EXT. WALL - GAS STATION - NIGHT
Fern rolls a cigarette. She smokes and watches the lights of
Rapid City in the distance.
EXT. VANGUARD - NEXT DAY
Fern is tidying up and she finds ants! Frustrated, she pulls
everything out to be cleaned.
DAVE
(walks by)
What’s going on?
FERN
Ants! I got ants!
DAVE
Oh, ants. They’re alright -FERN
They’re not alright, Dave! They are
in my food!
(beat)
What?
DAVE
I... got you these.
Dave hands her some sticks in a plastic bag.
FERN
What are they?
DAVE
I think it’s better if you don’t
drive through the park at night,
just for cigarettes. So, I got you
these licorice sticks -FERN
I can’t smoke licorice sticks.
DAVE
I know... But you can chew them. It
helps with the urge --

45.
FERN
I’m not gonna quit smoking, Dave.
DAVE
I know... But you should try these.
They are good for digestion too.
Fern keeps her cool and takes them from him.
FERN
...Fine. Thanks.
She fakes a smile and carries on. Dave tries to help her with
the box she is carrying. She dodges.
I got it.

FERN (CONT'D)

He picks up another box.
DAVE
Where do you want these -- ?
The bottom falls out. A stack of plates SHATTER.
Oh.

DAVE (CONT'D)

Fern freezes when she realizes they are the “autumn-leaf”
plates from her dad.
DAVE (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. I -FERN
(explodes)
Go over there!
Fern --

DAVE

FERN
Go! Stay over there!
DAVE
You don’t have to shout. I’m going.
Dave drops the box and walks away, frustration in his voice.
Fern regrets shouting right away, but her mind is on the
broken plates. She carefully picks them up.

46.
INT. VANGUARD - NIGHT
Fern glues the pieces back together. She manages to save one.
She looks at it for a moment, relieved.
EXT. CAMPGROUND BATHROOM - DAYS LATER
Without her friends, the work is becoming more lonesome.
Fern mops the floor and cleans vomit from a toilet seat.
EXT.

CEDAR PASS CAMPGROUND - LATER

Fern lights a cigarette whilst driving the golf cart. It’s
windy and her hair is a mess.
Fern sits with GRANDMA, a camper in her late seventies, thick
rimmed glasses, two rings on each finger. She is giving words
of wisdom while Fern listens politely.
GRANDMA
You are one of those lucky people
who is from the Unites States.
FERN
Yes ma’am. The U.S. Of A.
GRANDMA
And you can travel anywhere. And
they sometimes call you ‘nomads’ or
‘people who don’t have a home’. I
see that you have this ring. Are
you married?
FERN
I am. But my husband died.
GRANDMA
That ring is a circle and it never
ends. That means that your love
never ends. His love for you never
ends. And you may not be able to
take it off if you tried.
FERN
I don’t think I could.
EXT. BADLANDS - CAMPGROUND - MORNING WEEKS LATER
Storm in the badlands. Summer is coming to an end.

47.
EXT. VANGUARD - DAY
Fern boils canned soup on the camping stove.
INT. DAVE'S VAN - LATER
Fern pours the soup into a bowl.
Dave has a fever and is bed bound.
FERN
You need to eat something. I made
soup.
DAVE
Thanks. I don’t think I can.
The thermometer in his mouth beeps. Fern looks at it.
FERN
Still over a hundred!
DAVE
Fever’s good. It burns the bad
stuff off.
FERN
It’s been burning for a couple of
days, Dave!
DAVE
I’m fine. I’ll eat some of that...
Fern hands Dave the soup. He stares at it for a while.
FERN
You can’t eat it, can you?
DAVE
My stomach hurts. It’s probably a
bug.
FERN
A bug, or it could be something
serious.
DAVE
Yeah. It could be.
Really?!

FERN

48.

Yeah...

DAVE

EXT. RAPID CITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Fern smokes outside, watching people coming in and out.
INT. RAPID CITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Fern sits by herself in the empty hallway.
INT. RAPID CITY HOSPITAL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT
NURSE MATT
He has a case of diverticulitis,
which is an inflammation of his
intestines. They did a laparoscopic
surgery -FERN
He had surgery?!
NURSE MATT
It’s standard. He can leave and be
back at work in a week. Would you
like to see him?
FERN
...No. It’s ok. Bye.
EXT. ROAD ON PLAINS - SAME NIGHT
Fern drives. Eyes heavy, exhausted. She sees a gas station
and pulls over and goes to sleep.
I/E. VANGUARD OUTSIDE GAS STATION - NEXT MORNING
Fern eats a breakfast sandwich. She sees the pack of licorice
sticks Dave left her by the van door.
She tries one and hates it.
INT. GROCERY STORE ON PLAINS - SAME DAY
Fern carefully checks the prices and the expiration dates.

49.
INT. RAPID CITY HOSPITAL - ROOM - SAME DAY
Fern puts a few food items on the table. Dave lies in bed,
looking much healthier.
DAVE
Woo. Cup of noodles.
FERN
It’s great when you’re sick. And...
Juice box. Animal crackers. Jello.
And this.
She hands him a can of mackerel.
DAVE
That’s my favorite.
I know.

FERN

DAVE
(moved)
Thanks, Fern.
FERN
See you back at work. Two more
weeks left.
DAVE
Where’re you going afterwards?
FERN
Beet harvest in Nebraska.
DAVE
That doesn’t start until October.
FERN
What about you?
DAVE
I’m starting at Wall Drug. It’s
kind of fun, as far as retail goes.
I can see if they have an opening.
For me?
Yes.
Why?

FERN
DAVE
FERN

50.
DAVE
Good pay. Great parking. People are
nice... And, I don’t think you
should leave yet -FERN
Get better. Bye.
Fern waves and leaves without an answer.
INT. WALL DRUG - TWO WEEKS LATER
Fern is dressed in the green Wall Drug uniform, complete with
a green paper hat. She works in the busy dining hall boxing
donuts. Dave walks by with a huge tray of donuts.
Doing OK?

DAVE

FERN
Good, good, good!
The large restaurant is covered wall to wall in western
memorabilia and native American art work and gifts.
International exchange programs brought workers from
Philippines, Jamaica, Taiwan, and Slovakia. Fern works
amongst them and makes small talk.
Fern is assembling the famous hot roast beef sandwich at the
counter. Another WORKER rushes her to pick up the pace.
In the kitchen Dave is making large baskets of fries.
After hours, Fern and Dave play a duck shooting game in the
arcade. Fern helps Dave to pick out a new hunting knife.
EXT. REPTILE GARDEN - DAYS LATER
Fern follows Dave around the famed reptile garden. Dave
dressed up a bit, wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
At first Fern keeps her distance with a straight face. But
that ends when she sees TANK, a giant, 100 year old tortoise.
FERN
Oh my god. Look at him!!
Fern pets Tank with two YOUNG KIDS. Dave talks about what he
knows about Tank as if they are long time friends.
TERRY, the reptile specialist, wraps a large yellow python
around Fern’s neck. KIDS are gathered around them.

51.
FERN (CONT'D)
No, I don't like it. Keep its head
away from me!
Later, Fern’s level of bewilderment skyrockets when they
watch Terry feeding Maniac, the 1,350 pound crocodile, the
largest in North America.
Dave tries to keep his cool, but is very happy with himself
that Fern is having a great time.
EXT. WALL - DISPERSED CAMPING - EVENING
Dave is making dinner. Sausages and corn on the cob.
Fern is making a salad.
They eat together on the cliff of a breathtaking overview. A
silent comfort between them. It works.
EXT.

WALL DRUG - DUSK

Fern and Dave walk towards the famed 80ft Wall Drug dinosaur,
enclosed in metal fences and stands on a strip of barren land
next to the highway.
Fern smiles at Dave. He takes a picture of her on his phone.
EXT. CEDAR PASS CAMPGROUND - SAME NIGHT
Fern and Dave join BRAD, fifties, a cowboy astronomer, for a
planets demonstration under a starry night. CAMPERS coming
together carrying lamps of different sizes and shapes.
BRAD
That’s planet Vega in the midnorthern latitudes. Two thousand
light years away. It takes twentyfour years for it’s light to get
here to earth. If Vega dies tonight
and goes dark, we can still see its
light for the next twenty-four
years. How about that?
Fern, looks up at the sky, wondering what’s beyond the world
she knows.
BRAD (CONT'D)
The telescope is set up on Jupiter.
The largest planet in our solar
system.

52.
Fern looks through the telescope at Jupiter with a childlike
enthusiasm and wonder.
BRAD (CONT'D)
Stars blow up and they shoot plasma
and atoms out into space. They
sometimes land on earth, nourish
the soil and become part of you.
So hold out your right hand...
The group all hold out their hands.
BRAD (CONT'D)
...and look at a star. Because
there are atoms from stars that
blew up eons ago that landed on
this planet and now they’re in your
hand.
INT. WALL DRUG RESTAURANT - EVENING A WEEK LATER
Fern is cleaning up.
JAMES, a man in his early thirties, glances around the
restaurant.
FERN
Hi. Sorry, we’re closed.
JAMES
I’m looking for Dave. I’m his son,
James.
FERN
He’s in the kitchen....
That way?

JAMES

FERN
Just around the corner.
Fern watches James go. Dave never talked about his son.
INT. WALL DRUG - MOMENTS LATER
Fern tries to eavesdrop by the kitchen window, but their
voices are muffled by the fans.
James is talking most of the time. Dave’s body language is
stiff as he makes a burger.

53.
Later, while Fern mops the dining room floor, James walks in
with a tray of burger and fries.
FERN
Sit there. I just cleaned it.
JAMES
(sits down)
I’ve been through here, what,
twice?
(looks around the room)
This place is so weird. Who would
wanna live here?
FERN
(keeps cleaning)
I can think of worse places.
JAMES
(shakes ketchup)
I guess so... You wanna know the
best way to get to know a place?
FERN
What is it?
JAMES
AA meetings.
...Really?

FERN

JAMES
Back then when I was with the band,
I had to travel a lot. Man, I tell
you, you don’t really get to know a
place until you show up at their AA
meetings.
FERN
You been to one around here?
JAMES
Yeah. In Rapid City. Man. So weird.
How come?

FERN

JAMES
Not in a bad way. You know? It’s
like... every AA meeting I’ve been
to around this whole fucking
country. People are all the same.
(MORE)

54.
JAMES (CONT'D)
We all got the same fucking
problems. The same shit to deal
with. Isn’t that nice to know?
Fern gives James a closer look. He looks like his father.
FERN
How’s the burger?
It’s OK.

JAMES

FERN
Good cook, your Dad.
JAMES
It’s not that hard to make a
burger.
FERN
Oooh. Harsh.
They exchange a smile.
INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
Dave shows Fern a photo on his flip-phone: James and a young
WOMAN together. She is pregnant.
DAVE
That’s his wife Emily. She’s about
to have a baby.
FERN
You’re going to be a grandfather!
When’s she due?
DAVE
In two weeks. James’s on his way
back home now... He wants me to go
back with him.
FERN
You should go.
Dave thinks for a moment. Then he goes over to the greasy
grill and starts to scrub it.
Fern waits, quietly tearing the lettuce in her hands.

55.
DAVE
I was... He doesn’t like that I
wasn’t around much when he was
young. Which is, obviously, my
fault. And when he got older, I
tried to be around, but I guess I
just forgot how to be a dad.
Anyway, I wasn’t very good at it.
We are ok now. I’m just not sure if
he really wants me to be there.
FERN
Oh, I think he does.
Yeah?

DAVE

FERN
Don’t think about it too much,
Dave. Just go. Be a grandfather.
Fern finishes tearing the bag of lettuce and walks over to
the over-sized fridge.
Dave looks back at Fern who is trying to stuff the large
lettuce bag into the fridge that’s clearly too full.
DAVE
Do you want to come with me?
Where?

FERN

Fern gives up trying to make the bag fit. She turns to Dave.
DAVE
Maybe not if you don’t want to.
FERN
I can visit sometime.
DAVE
Yeah. Great.
Fern looks down at the bag of lettuce she’s holding, not sure
what to do with it or what else to say.
I/E. VANGUARD - NEXT MORNING
Fern is awake. She can hear Dave packing up his van and
walking over. A knock on the door. She ignores it.

56.
Through the gap of the curtain, Dave waits a moment, then
puts something on the ground and leaves.
Moments later, Fern opens the door, just in time to see
Dave’s van pulling onto the highway in the distance. The
trail of dust it left behind slowly settles.
Fern finds a rock by her footstool. It’s smooth with holes -the kind you find on the beach. And a note from Dave - ‘If
you visit, there’s plenty more of these’.
The wind is strong. Fern sits for a moment, then holds up the
rock and looks through the hole at the boundless badlands...
INT. WALL DRUG - EVENING DAYS LATER
Fern cleans the greasy grill.
She climbs on top of a large Jackalope statue and pretends to
be a rodeo cowboy.
She plays duck shooting game in the empty arcade.
She takes a selfie with a plastic model of Mount Rushmore.
EXT. VANGUARD - EVENING
Fern makes canned sardine on toast.
She watches a group of COWBOYS drinking beers by a pickup in
the distance. One of them sings a song on the guitar.
EXT. WALL DRUG - NIGHTS LATER
Street lights pass overhead. Summer tourist season is over.
Most of the stores are shut.
Fern walks down the empty street. Her shadow gets longer as
she disappears into the night.
EXT. WESTERN SUGAR - NEBRASKA - WEEKS LATER
Cold wind blows across the dusty plains. It’s late autumn in
Scottsbluff, Nebraska.
The barren landscape of Western Sugar, filled with beet
fields, beet piles and trucks. Large sugar beets tumble onto
a conveyor belt. The sound is deafening.

57.
Fern is wearing a hard hat, safety vest and goggles as she
shovels beets and signals incoming trucks.
EXT. DOWNTOWN SCOTTSBLUFF - NEXT MORNING
Fern does laundry.
She eats at a Mexican restaurant, a FAMILY sitting at the
other end is giving the father his birthday celebration.
EXT. WESTERN SUGAR - DAYS LATER
The work and weather is harsh and Fern looks exhausted. But
she keeps going with pride in her hard work.
She sits in the door of her van, warming herself up sipping a
bowl of cup noodles. She looks on, the open lot is dotted
with vehicles -- occupied by migrant workers like herself.
EXT. SCOTTSBLUFF - NIGHT DAYS LATER
Fern walks by the historic Midwest theater. THREE CHATTY
FRIENDS are standing outside waiting. Colorful posters of
“The Avengers” in the window.
Fern checks out the window displays of a closed bridal shop.
She gives a cigarette to a HOMELESS MAN.
EXT. WESTERN SUGAR - NIGHT WEEKS LATER
Piles of beets falling from the piler into the convertible
bell. Dust, steam, Fern working. Time passing.
After a night of hard work, MIGRANT WORKERS gather around a
burn barrel to stay warm.
Fern watches them from afar. A GROUP OF MEN are talking about
football. A COUPLE are arguing.
INT. VANGUARD - MORNING
The sound of a loud truck wakes Fern up. She tries to go back
to sleep. Her phone beeps.
She gets a video message. It’s from Swankie.

58.
Fern watches it -- Swankie films from her kayak underneath a
cliff populated with swallows. The migratory birds fly around
her and she picks up a small egg shell from the water.
Fern can’t help but to smile.
FERN
You made it, Swankie.
INT. SCOTTSBLUFF - SHOWER - MORNING
Fern scrubs dirt off of her hair and nails. She looks at
herself in the mirror.
Time to move on again.
EXT. SCOTTSBLUFF - STRIP MALL - VANGUARD - NIGHT
Snow is falling. Vanguard is parked in the empty parking lot.
INT. VANGUARD - NIGHT
Fern is enjoying some friend chicken beside her Mr. Buddy
heater. She hears a tiny noise, looks up and sees a MAN
looking in from the gap of the curtain.
She freaks out and pulls the curtain shut, almost choking on
her chicken.
LOUD knocks.
MAN (O.S.)
You can’t sleep here! There’s no
overnight parking!
FERN
Ok! Sorry! I’m leaving! I’m
leaving...
Fern scrambles to get ready to leave.
EXT. ROAD ON PLAINS - EVENING
Fern drives. The plains turn flatter and colder. It’s harvest
time. Tractors and field workers in the distance...
INT. FUR TRADE MUSEUM - DAY
Fern walks down rows and rows of pioneer artifacts.

59.
She watches an igloo being built in “Nanook of the North”.
She buys a beaver pelt.
EXT. VANGUARD OUTSIDE FUR TRADE MUSEUM - DAY
Fern hangs the beaver pelt above her bed. Happy with it.
She puts the key in the ignition and starts the van. Silence.
FERN
Oh no. No. No...
She tries again and again, nothing. It’s dead.
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
Fern waits impatiently in the garage.
KEN THE CAR DOCTOR, fifties, a nervous but sympathetic man,
pulls parts out of the hood. The noises make Fern nervous.
Later, Ken hands her the estimate behind the counter, while
his son JERMEY surfs the internet next to him.
KEN
This is what you’re looking at.
Parts and labor twenty three
hundred dollars with tax.
Yikes.

FERN

Fern looks mortified.
JEREMY
I just looked up the value on your
van. A 2004 E150. With that high
milage, you’re at best looking at
five thousand dollars.
KEN
So I would recommend taking that
money and putting it towards
another vehicle instead -FERN
(distressed)
No, well, I can’t do that! I can’t
do that! See... I spent a lot of
time and money building the inside
out.
(MORE)

60.
FERN (CONT'D)
A lot of people don’t understand
the value of that, but it’s not
something you can just... I live in
there. It’s my home.
EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
Fern paces frantically whilst on the phone.
FERN
I’m going back to Amazon in a
couple of weeks and I can pay you
back with my first pay check.
She takes a deep breath and tries to listen to the response.
FERN (CONT'D)
I can’t! I don’t have a car... no I
don’t want to take the bus.
(beat)
Why? You think I’m being difficult?
I think you’re being a bitch!
Fern hangs up and lights a cigarette.
Later, Ken finds Fern ironing a yellow shirt in her van.
KEN
I’m about to lock up...
FERN
Almost done.
KEN
(peaks in)
It is a very nice van, ma’am.
FERN
Thanks... Mind if I keep it here?
I’m going to my sister’s tomorrow
to get the money. Can you make sure
she’s safe?
KEN
I got a few cars parked behind you
in the same situation. It’ll be
safe.
After Ken leaves, Fern looks around -- she is surrounded by
broken down vehicles, waiting for their owners’ return.

61.
EXT. WESTERN TERMINAL - MORNING
Fern shivers in line, chowing down a hot dog. She is careful
so it doesn’t get onto the nicely ironed yellow shirt.
INT. BUS ON ROAD - DAY
Rows of suburban houses flash by.
Fern looks out of the window. A GROUP OF CHINESE TOURISTS are
chatting behind her.
EXT. DOLLY’S HOUSE - EVENING
A nice suburban home outside Denver.
Fern walks up to the front porch. She presses the door bell.
No one answers. She presses it over and over again.
DOLLY, Fern’s sister, swings the door open.
DOLLY
Hi Fern. That door bell works.
FERN
Well, I couldn’t hear it.
They give each other a stiff hug.
DOLLY
Woah. You cut your hair.
FERN
Yep. What? What Dolly?
Nothing --

DOLLY

FERN
Oh my god! I haven’t even stepped
into the door yet -DOLLY
Come on in!
INT. DOLLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Dolly peels vegetables at the counter crowded by dishes.
Fern eats a cookie from the tray. Not great. She forces it
down and takes out the beaver pelt.

62.
FERN
I bought you a gift.
DOLLY
What is it?
FERN
It’s a beaver pelt.
DOLLY
What am I supposed to do with a
beaver pelt?
FERN
It’s decorative. Put it up
somewhere.
DOLLY
Can you make your four egg cake for
me? George has some friends over.
FERN
Are you going to tell them I made
it, or that you did?
Dolly ignores her.
FERN (CONT'D)
I’ll make the cake. But then I have
to leave.
DOLLY
No. I want you to stay the night.
FERN
I can’t. I gotta get back.
DOLLY
Get back where?
FERN
To the garage to pick up my van!
DOLLY
It’s just a van! It’ll be there.
You can’t just stay for one night?
FERN
Dolly! You know what...?
(calms herself)
Why do you have to make me come all
the way here to lend me money? Why?

63.
DOLLY
Because I want to make sure my
sister’s still alive.
FERN
Why wouldn’t I be?
DOLLY
You never visit. When I tried to
call you, you never answer.
FERN
I never have gas money or signal.
The banter reaches a dead end. They stay quiet for a moment.
FERN (CONT'D)
Do you even have enough eggs?
EXT. DOLLY'S HOUSE - GARDEN - EVENING
Burgers sizzle on the barbecue.
FERN
Got my famous four egg cake.
George, Dolly’s husband is on barbecue duty.
FERN (CONT'D)
Dolly talked me into it. Where do
you want it?
GEORGE
Right there is fine.
Fern inspects the burgers.
FERN
I want that one.
GEORGE
It’s got your name on it.
Fern pours another drink of tequila on the rocks, which is
helping with her talkative mood. Dolly introduces Fern to
George’s coworker JIM and PAM.
DOLLY
This is my sister, Fern.
JIM
Hi Fern, I’m Jim. This is my wife
Pam.

64.
DOLLY
Jim has been working with George
for a long time.
JIM
George actually sold us our first
house before I got into real
estate. I’ve learned everything
from him -FERN
Did Dolly ever tell you how they
met?
No...

JIM

Dolly laughs nervously.
FERN
I introduced Dolly to George, but I
knew George from way before. Long
story. You see, my sister’s a
flirt, Pam, she’d flirt with a
rock. So I took her out and I said
‘Listen, George is a really good
friend of mine. I don’t want you to
mess this up. If you’re not serious
about him, don’t mess with him’ -DOLLY
And I didn’t ‘mess it up’ -FERN
How many years have you been
together?
DOLLY
Thirty plus.
JIM
Worked out pretty good.
DOLLY
I was able to take care of things
myself after that ‘introduction’ -FERN
You’re welcome.
Later, everyone digs into Fern’s cake and starts to talk
about real estate. George is optimistic.

65.
GEORGE
It’s been a good year. We’ve got
more home sales and new
constructions. The stakeholders are
seriously talking about mortgagedebt forgiveness.
Fern snorts. She is tipsy.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I think when we look back, we’re
gonna say, yes we hit the bottom
back in 2008. It was bad. But 2012
is the year that things are finally
looking up again.
FERN
I don’t want to disagree with you,
but I really do.
GEORGE
I’m just saying its finally getting
better. Jim?
JIM
We’ve got the numbers.
FERN
Yeah. The numbers. The numbers. But
how long do you think it lasts
before it crashes again? And what
if this time you can’t get back up?
What if you lose everything? I’ve
met plenty of people like that. I
think it’s strange that you
encourage people to use their life
savings, to get in debt, just to
buy houses they can’t afford!
GEORGE
Come on Fern. That’s a very limited
view on what we do -FERN
Is it limited, George?
GEORGE
We help people build homes. So they
can start a family, have children,
take care of their parents. I mean,
we can’t all just chuck everything
and hit the road --

66.
FERN
Is that what you think I did?! I
chucked everything and hit the
road?!
Fern’s outburst brought on uncomfortable silence.
DOLLY
...That’s not fair, George.
GEORGE
Right. I’m sorry.
More silence.
JIM
I... think... What George is trying
to say is that... We can’t all do
what you do. I think the way you
live is exciting and brave. And
frankly I’m jealous. But we can’t
all take the plunge, right? What
kind of society would that be?
Fern swallows her words with more tequila.
JIM (CONT'D)
Also I don’t think we should ignore
the problem of homelessness. My
mother was homeless when she was a
teenager. It’s a serious problem -FERN
I’m not homeless.
Fern looks up at Jim, firmly.
FERN (CONT'D)
I am houseless. Not homeless. There
is a difference.
DOLLY
There is.
(tries to defuse the
situation)
I mean if you think about it, what
the nomads are doing is not that
different than what the pioneers
did, right? They went west in their
wagons, living on the road. Fern is
a part of the American tradition. I
think it’s great!
Fern forces a smile and goes back to her cake.

67.
EXT. DOLLY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Fern sits on the edge of the bed, knitting a pot holder.
Dolly walks in and sits down next to her.
DOLLY
Here you go.
She hands Fern an envelope. Fern looks into it and finds the
cash needed for Vanguard’s repair. She’s relieved.
FERN
Thanks, Dol. You know I’ll pay you
back right? I will.
I know.

DOLLY

Fern puts the money away. Dolly hesitates.
DOLLY (CONT'D)
Wes is getting married.
Who?

FERN

DOLLY
Our cousin Wes?
FERN
Oh! Good for him.
DOLLY
Everyone is going back to Gibson
for the wedding. You should come
too. People ask about you.
FERN
(sarcastic)
Tell them the usual -- I live in a
van and have no money for gas.
DOLLY
You know what? I tell people how
great you’re doing. I tell them
you’re traveling all over the
country, having a great time.
FERN
It’s not like that. It’s not some
great adventure. I just don’t want
to be comfortable anymore. I want
to take a risk and try something
different... What?

68.
Dolly is smiling to herself.
DOLLY
Oh Fern, that’s what you always
want. It’s always what’s out there
that’s more interesting. You left
home as soon as you could. You
married Beau when you only knew him
for a few months. And you dropped
everything and moved to the middle
of nowhere with him. Even after
Beau passed away, you still stayed
in Empire. I just don’t get it. You
could’ve left, did something with
you life, or met someone -FERN
This is why I don’t want to come
here.
Dolly knows she has hit a nerve. She softens.
DOLLY
I’ve never said this to you before.
Maybe I should have... You’ve
always been the eccentric one
growing up. People thought you were
weird, but really, you were just
braver and more honest than any of
us. You can see me, when I try to
hide from everyone. Sometimes you
see me before I see myself. I
needed you in my life... And you’re
my sister. I would’ve loved to have
you around all these years. You
left a big hole by leaving.
Fern fights back tears and guilt.
EXT. DOLLY'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
Fern smokes on the curb.
Dolly comes out and hands her a packed lunch. They hug.
Fern walks away. She looks back for a moment, hesitates, but
keeps on going.
EXT. GARAGE - EVENING
Fern climbs into the driver’s seat of Vanguard and starts the
engine. It runs good. Ken closes the hood and walks over.

69.
KEN
She’s ready to go. I threw in an
oil change and rotated your tires.
FERN
Thank you so much.
KEN
Where’re you headed?
FERN
(beat)
I don’t know.
KEN
Well, good luck to you.
Ken walks away. Fern sits there for a moment longer. Slowly,
she gives the steering wheel a hug.
EXT. ROADS - TIME PASSING
Fern travels south, taking her time, wandering, camping,
sleeping at truck stops and parking lots.
She drives through the Sandhills, mountains, canyons, back in
the desert.
INT. NEEDLES, CALIFORNIA - VANGUARD - MORNING
Fern is making PBJ sandwich. A knock on the door.
VOICE
Police. Open the door.
EXT. NEEDLES - RESIDENTIAL STREET - VANGUARD - MORNING
Vanguard is parked on a nice residential neighborhood.
Fern is all smiles while OFFICER STEVE runs her ID. She
notices a WOMAN taking her trash out and glancing over at
them. From the look on her face, it won’t surprise Fern that
it was this woman that called the police.
OFFICER STEVE
Are you living in your vehicle?
FERN
Only part-time.

70.
OFFICER STEVE
You know there is no camping
allowed on residential streets in
the city limit.
FERN
Yes! I was just traveling through.
I took a nap and overslept.
OFFICER STEVE
(doesn’t believe her)
If you need a place. Out in the
county you can do whatever you
want. Just keep driving until you
hit dirt.
Officer Steve gives Fern’s ID another look.
OFFICER STEVE (CONT'D)
You look familiar.
FERN
People say that about me.
OFFICER STEVE
(hands her the ID)
Aright, Frances. You take care.
FERN
Thank you, officer, bye.
Fern watches Officer Steve leave and waves. As soon as he is
out of sight, she scrambles back into her van.
EXT. NEEDLES - RURAL AREA - EVENING
An abandoned open space next to the busy highway.
Fern sits outside the van, knitting while eating a sandwich.
She notices a young man sitting under a mesa oak by a fire.
She is concerned at the sight of the young traveller, packs
up the other half of the sandwich and walks towards him.
The young man is warming up a can of beans on the fire.
FERN
Hi, want a sandwich?
She recognizes him -- Derek, the tattooed young traveller she
met in Quartzsite.

71.
DEREK
I think I’ve met you before.
FERN
Yes, I’m Fern. I was working at TRock in Quartzsite.
DEREK
You let Noodle sell his jewelry
there, didn’t ya?
Yep.

FERN

DEREK
Would you like a beer?
FERN
Ok. I’ll trade you for a sandwich.
Right on.

DEREK

They make the exchange.
DEREK (CONT'D)
It’s cold. You should sit down by
the fire.
FERN
(considers)
Ok. Why not.
She sits down. It’s nice and warm.
DEREK
You gave me a lighter back in
quartzite.
FERN
You still have it?
DEREK
No, that’s long gone but I do have
this for ya.
Derek takes out a silver lighter cover, with a brown stone
incased in it. He offers it to Fern.
DEREK (CONT'D)
I want you to have it.

72.
FERN
(takes it)
...Thanks. It’s really beautiful.
What’s that stone?
DEREK
That right there is dinosaur bone.
Really?

FERN

DEREK
Really. But I only know what they
tell me.
FERN
Where’s the bus? And your friends?
DEREK
The bus? Oh, the bus. They went
down to New Orleans.
FERN
I thought you all traveled
together.
DEREK
No... Noodle, Roxy and all of them
you saw with the bus, they come to
Quartzsite every winter to buy
gemstones and then they sell them
during their travels for the rest
of the year.
FERN
You don’t do that?
DEREK
No, ma’am. You gotta be a people
person to sell anything. I like
helping out on ranches, working
with animals.
FERN
And travel.
DEREK
And travel.
FERN
You always been like this?

73.
DEREK
I suppose... Ever since I was
little. I never liked what other
kids my age did, playing video
games and stuff like that. I always
just walked the railroad tracks.
Once I pass all the trees and
forests, I can see it going all the
way to the horizon. And I couldn’t
help it. As soon as I was old
enough, I started to jump trains. I
like the west. I like being able to
see the horizon.
Derek lights a cigarette. Fern watches him.
FERN
...How old are you?
DEREK
Twenty-one years.
FERN
That’s... Impressive. Where are
your mom and dad?
DEREK
Back home in Wisconsin.
FERN
Think they worry about you?
Derek avoids the question.
FERN (CONT'D)
You don’t get lonely? Got a
girlfriend anywhere?
DEREK
Well, to be truthful, there is one.
She lives up near Lake Superior
Small farm. She’s happy with her
life there. I’m happy with mine.
(beat)
I write letters to her.
FERN
Smart man. Letters are good.
DEREK
But I can’t write about anything I
reckon she’d care about.

74.
FERN
You ever try poems?
DEREK
Can’t say I have. I don’t think I
know one. Do you know any?
FERN
How about one I used for my wedding
vows when I was not much older than
you?
DEREK
Right on. Mind if I hear it?
FERN
Aright. Lets see if I can remember
it...
(beat)
’Shall I compare thee to a summer’s
day? Thou art more lovely and more
temperate/ Rough winds do shake the
darling buds of May/ And summer’s
lease hath all too short a date/
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven
shines.
EXT. NEEDLES - RURAL AREA - NEXT MORNING
The early morning of city lights in the distance.
Fern watches Derek as he walks away towards the highway.
FERN (V.O.)
And often is his gold complexion
dimm'd/ And every fair from fair
sometime declines, By chance or
nature’s changing course undimm'd.
Inside Vanguard, Fern opens a binder of old slides. She looks
at them through a viewer. A faint light illuminates past
memories -- Images of Fern as a little girl. Her parents and
her sister. Family life, summer trips, holidays meals...
FERN (V.O.)
But thy eternal summer shall not
fade/ Nor lose possession of that
fair thou ow’st/ Nor shall death
brag thou wander’st in his shade/
When in eternal lines to time thou
grow’st/ So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see/ So long lives
this, and this gives life to thee.

75.
EXT. REDWOODS, CALIFORNIA - MORNING
The redwoods of northern California.
Fern looks up, mesmerized by these ancient giants -- the
tallest living beings on the Earth.
EXT. CALFORNIA COAST - LATER
Vanguard weaves along coastal roads. The Pacific Ocean
suddenly appears.
The sun a golden orb bursting through sea mist.
EXT. DAVE’S HOUSE - MORNING DAYS LATER
Fern pulls into the well-kept homestead with a beautiful
ranch house surrounded by trees.
Woah.

FERN

She gets out of the van, taking with her a nicely-ironed blue
jean dress on a hanger and a box of chocolate.
Dave’s van is parked by the bushes. One of the tires is flat.
Fern peeks inside. It looks unused and empty.
She walks towards the front door.
Fern!

VOICE

Dave comes out in a hurry.
DAVE
You made it!
Yeah. Hi!

FERN

Dave shows her in through the gate and introduces her to his
daughter-in-law EMILY, who is working in the garden.
DAVE
This is my daughter-in-law Emily.
FERN
Hi! Here --

76.
EMILY
(takes the chocolate)
Oh, thanks. So nice to finally meet
you. We’ve heard so much about you.
INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY
Fern walks into the living room and is immediately surrounded
with Dave’s family and friends.
DAVE
Hey everyone, this is Fern.
VOICES
Hi Fern! Hello! Welcome!
Everyone makes small talk with her. There’s a special effort
to make her feel welcome, until the new BABY begins to cry.
INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Fern recovers for a moment in solitude. She sits on the large
bed, in a room that feels abnormally spacious.
INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - BABY ROOM - LATER
The sound of chatting and cooking in the kitchen.
Fern folds baby laundry, while Dave entertains the baby. He
is good with him.
FERN
You’ve got a flat.
Huh?

DAVE

FERN
Your van. One of your tires is
flat, Dave.
DAVE
Oh. Ok. I haven’t noticed.
FERN
Because you’re staying?
Yeah...

DAVE

77.

Good.

FERN

DAVE
I never expected to. Never thought
I’d spend another night under a
roof, but... It was getting pretty
lonely out there.
FERN
You had friends.
Yeah...

DAVE

FERN
What about Bob? You’ve known him
for years. And your friends at RTR?
DAVE
Yeah... But every time I say “bye”
to them, I don’t know If I’m going
to see them again. And most of the
time, I never see them again. It’s
fine at first... but, a decade of
that is something else.
Fern knows he is right. She has felt it too.
FERN
Well, it’s really nice here.
DAVE
Yeah. It’s not bad... you can stay.
FERN
Great. Thanks. I gotta do laundry.
DAVE
(smiles)
Yes. Laundry.
FERN
And a bath.
DAVE
I meant staying longer, Fern. They
have a guest house.
Fern gives Dave a look.
DAVE (CONT'D)
I’m serious.

78.
FERN
What do they think about that?
DAVE
I asked them already.
Unexpected, Fern stays quiet.
DAVE (CONT'D)
I like you. You’re a really good
person. You get along with people,
for the most part and... I like
being around you.
Fern didn’t expect Dave’s directness and honesty. She still
doesn’t know what to say.
DAVE (CONT'D)
We should drive to the beach
tomorrow if the weather is good.
(to the baby)
What do you think? We should take
her to the beach, yeah? Yeah...
INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING
A knife carves through a perfectly cooked turkey.
The family and friends are gathered having dinner together.
The mood is jovial. They pass around the food. Fern helps
James with his plate. Dave taps his glass.
DAVE
I just want to say a little welcome
to Fern. To the new one and the old
ones too and everyone in between.
So welcome Fern.
They clink glasses.
FERN
Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving!
Fern chows down the delicious food. She looks around and
considers the option of a second chance at a family life.
EXT.

DAVE'S HOUSE - PORCH - LATER

Fern stands on the porch to have a cigarette. Emily comes out
to join her.

79.
EMILY
Could I have one of those?
FERN
Yeah, sure. They’re roll-ups.
EMILY
That’s OK. I’m trying to quit, with
the baby and all. But...
She lights it and takes a drag, satisfied.
FERN
I’ve given up trying. My friend
Linda May quit over night after
forty-three years. How about that?
They share a laugh.
EMILY
I’m really glad you’re here. Dave
talks about you a lot.
Yeah?

FERN

EMILY
He really likes you.
FERN
Yeah?
(changes subject)
You have a nice garden.
EMILY
It looks a lot better in the
summer. Did you have a garden?
FERN
No. But we had a really great lawn.
EMILY
Was that hard to do? Empire’s in
the desert, right? I like that
name, Empire.
FERN
When I first went there I couldn’t
believe how green the whole town
was. Everyone’s got green lawns.
Stupid to waste that much water I
guess. We even had a public pool
and a golf course.

80.
EMILY
Like an oasis.
It was.

FERN

Fern looks towards the dark tree lines in the distance.
FERN (CONT'D)
Our house was right on the edge of
the town. The backyard looked out
at this huge open space. It’s just
desert, desert, all the way to the
mountains.
(beat)
There was nothing in our way.
INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Fern takes a bath. Bliss. Like it’s the first time in years.
INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - STAIRS - LATER
Fern carries her laundry down the stairs. She hears music and
looks into the study -Dave and James are playing the piano together. A simple
melody in beautiful synchronicity -- something father and son
had played together many times in the past
Fern watches them. She is moved at first, smiling gently.
Then, something restless stirs inside of her. She suddenly
feels a little short of breath.
INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - THAT NIGHT
Fern lies in bed, unable to sleep. She stares at the ceiling.
It feels too tall.
She gets up and walks out of the dark room.
EXT. DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Fern walks out of the house and runs to Vanguard.
She climbs in, closes the door and lies under the covers.
She touches the ceiling. A moment. She closes her eyes.

81.
EXT. DAVE’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
Dark clouds on the horizon. A storm is approaching.
Fern stands outside Vanguard and smokes a cigarette.
She looks up at Dave’s house. It’s beautiful and tranquil.
INT. DAVE'S HOUSE - LIVING/DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Everyone is still asleep. The house is quiet.
Fern looks at the family photos of different generations on
the wall. She recognizes a younger Dave with an infant James.
She sits down at the empty dining room table and looks
around. Silence.
A moment passes, Fern gets up, quietly straightens the wooden
chair and walks away.
EXT. ROAD IN TOWN - SAME MORNING
Large rain drops on windshield.
Fern drives through the quiet town lashed with wind and rain.
EXT. OCEAN - SAME MORNING
Fern walks around the cliff in the heavy wind and rain. She
takes off her hat and lets the rain wash down her face.
A bird soars on the gale. Alone, fragile, but free.
EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - MORNING A WEEK LATER
Fern lines up waiting with SEASONAL WORKERS. Same as the
previous year, she looks around and notices AL again.
He nods at her and she nods back.
AL
Seems like more every year.
INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - DAY
Fern works at the packaging station. She is now wearing the
orange blazer that reads “Ambassador, Ask Me.”

82.
She curiously studies one of her new co-workers -- a hightech DELIVERY ROBOT on the floor.
EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - EVENING DAYS LATER
Fern does laundry and solves a jigsaw puzzle alone.
EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE - EVENING A MONTH LATER
Fern smokes in the cold air as she facetimes with Linda May.
Doug walks by her, shivering.
DOUG
See you next year, Fern. Happy
holidays.
FERN
You too, Doug.
EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK - VANGUARD - NEW YEAR EVE
Fern sits on the footstep of Vanguard and lights a sparkler.
She smiles watching and adjusts her Happy New Year headband.
2013, another year arrives.
INT.

VANGUARD - EVENING A WEEK LATER

Familiar desert landscapes and sunsets flash by the window as
Fern arrives back in Quartzsite, Arizona.
EXT.

DESERT - EVENING

Fern, with her head down, hikes the desert, looking for a
rock. She finally picks up one and feels its rough edges.
She looks back -The Rubber Tramp Rendezvous camp is in the distance. It has
grown in size since last year.
EXT.

RTR - CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

A group of NOMADS gathered around a campfire to remember
Swankie. One by one they toss a stone into the fire.

83.
Bob Wells walks to the fire and looks down into the flames.
BOB WELLS
So long, Swankie. See you down the
road.
He tosses a rock into the flames.
Fern stands next and tosses another rock. The embers rise up
into the night sky, disappearing amongst the stars.
EXT.

DESERT - NEXT DAWN

The first light of the morning sky.
Fern and Bob Wells sit together beside his van.
FERN
I’ve been thinking a lot in the
past year about why I didn’t just
leave Empire when my husband Beau
died. I could’ve left and started a
new life sooner. But... I think I
somehow made up my mind that if I
just packed up and left, it would
be as if Beau never existed. You
see... Beau never knew his parents
and we never had kids. But he loved
Empire. He loved being there. He
loved his work. Everybody loved
him. So I stayed. Same town, same
house. It’s like my dad used to say
‘what’s remembered, lives’.
(beat)
I might’ve spent too much of my
life just... remembering. Know what
I mean, Bob?
BOB WELLS
I can relate... I rarely talk about
my son, but he took his own life
five years ago... Like you, I think
I’ve made up my mind that I’m going
to be his rememberer. I carry him
everywhere I go. I realized I could
honor him by helping people. It
gives me a reason to go through the
day. Some days thats all I’ve got.
They share an understanding smile.

84.
BOB WELLS (CONT'D)
Out here there’s a lot of people
our age carrying grief and loss
with them. Most of them don’t get
over it, and that’s OK. That’s OK.
(beat)
One of the things I love most about
this life is that there’s no final
goodbye. I’ve met hundreds of
people out here and we don’t ever
say a final goodbye. We just say
‘I’ll see you down the road’. And I
do. Whether it’s a month or a year
or sometimes years, I see them
again. I can look down the road and
I feel certain in my heart that
I’ll see my son again. You’ll see
Beau again and you can remember
your life together then.
Fern smiles through her tears. She cherishes Bob’s words.
They’re a gift.
EXT. ROAD - DESERT IN NORTHERN NEVADA - EVENING
Vanguard travels through a vast landscape. Gradually, the
familiar snowy high desert near Empire comes into view.
INT. VANGUARD - EVENING
Fern drives, approaching the blue gates of the storage unit.
EXT. EMPIRE - STORAGE UNIT - EVENING
Gay, the storage unit owner, and his grandson NICK, load
everything from Fern’s unit into a pick-up.
NICK
Is that all, Mrs. M?
FERN
That’s it, Nick. Thank you. You got
taller.
NICK
Yeah? Well, thanks. See ya, Mrs. M.
Fern gives Gay her final payment.

85.
GAY
Sure you don’t want to keep any of
it?
Fern looks over at the possessions from her past. They look
foreign to her now.
FERN
No. I won’t miss any of it. Yard
sale?
GAY
Sure. But it’s hard these days.
Those Burners, they have money now.
They don’t stop here to scavenge
anymore. They’ve got their big rigs
flew in from San Francisco and all
over the place.
Really.

FERN

GAY
Yeah. Time has changed.
EXT. EMPIRE - FACTORY - EVENING
Fern walks towards the factory. She runs into ALBERT and
BERNIE, the mine’s last caretaker and his wife.
Albert opens the factory door for Fern.
ALBERT
I’m the last employee. Kind of. I
just go around and make sure things
aren’t vandalized. And make sure
the llamas are alright.
Llamas?

FERN

ALBERT
Well, the company got some goats to
keep the lawn weeds down. But the
coyotes came and started to get the
goats. So, they got two llamas to
keep the coyotes away. But the
coyotes got the goats anyway. Now
those llamas are out of work. They
just live here now.

86.
INT. EMPIRE MINE - FACTORY - EVENING
Albert wipes off the dust on a red button on a control panel.
He recounts the last day at the factory. His voice lingers as
Fern walks around the empty factory.
ALBERT
It was around two o’clock. All the
workers were in here. And when it
was time, I pushed the button.
Everything just came to a halt. It
was quiet in here. Too quiet. The
last thing you want to hear in a
factory is silence.
(beat)
I thought of Beau on that day. I
wish he was here. We would’ve asked
him to stop the production line. It
was an honor to be able to do that.
The longest running mine in America
and he was one of our best. And he
was a good friend too.
EXT. EMPIRE - EVENING
Two llamas are wandering the empty street between rows of
abandoned houses, munching on lawn weeds.
Fern walks past carefully not to disturb them.
She passes by the old baseball field, school, church, golf
course. All frozen in time.
I/E. EMPIRE - FERN’S HOUSE - EVENING
Fern stands in front of her old house for a moment, the small
red mailbox is covered in rust.
She walks through the empty house, stepping over broken floor
tiles and tumbleweeds, onto the backyard where she shared
happy memories with the man she loved. The rosebushes she
planted are still there, withered.
Fern is unable to move, not forward nor back. She allows
herself, for a moment longer, to be lost in time.
Then she walks on, leaving the yard behind, passing the fence
door, towards the endless desert lies beyond, stretching all
the way to the horizon.
FADE TO BLACK.
