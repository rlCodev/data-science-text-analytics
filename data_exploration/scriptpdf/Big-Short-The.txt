The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slowwitted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but
the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most
intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows
already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.

OPEN ON: INT. SOLOMON BROTHERS - 1979 - DAY

1

A bunch of FAT BOND TRADERS eat deli sandwiches and smoke
cigarettes on the Solomon Brothers Bond Trading floor. It’s
not exactly Michael Douglas in Wall Street.
The voice that walks us through this is smart, too the point
and slick. We’ll meet him later.
MODERN TRADER (V.O.)
In the late seventies banking was
not a job you went into to make
large sums of money. It was a good
stable profession like selling
insurance or accounting. And if
banking was boring then the bond
department at a bank was downright
comatose. We all know about bonds,
give em to your nephew when he
turns 16 and then we he’s thirty he
makes a hundred dollars. Yawn.
Bonds were for losers. That is,
until Lewis Ranieri came on the
scene at Solomon Brothers...
MUSIC: Some great 70’s ballad like KISS YOU ALL OVER by EXILE
We see an even schlubbier version of the other Bond Traders
emerge. His suit is rumpled, he has a mustard stain on his
shirt from a soft pretzel he’s eating and he is easily
seventy pounds over weight. This is LEWIS RENIERI. And though
his world is obscure, he is the shit.
Our NARRATOR the MODERN TRADER passes through the scene for a
second, dressed in modern clothes...
Lewis greets his Bond Department with obscenities barked
through his patchy beard and glasses.
MODERN TRADER (V.O.)
You see Lewis didn’t know it yet,
but he had already changed banking
forever. He had just one simple
idea...

FUND MANAGER
What is that?
BOND TRADER
I hope you don’t say that when you
look at your wife’s pussy!
They all HOWL except the fund manager who looks shocked but
then finally laughs to fit in.
LEWIS RANIERI
Here’s how it works. You’ve got
your average person’s mortgage.
Fixed rate, 30 years...
We see A HOUSE on the over head projector.
LEWIS RANIERI (CONT’D)
Boring, safe, small pay off...
Right? But when you have thousands
of them all bundled together...
We see an illustration of many homes. The next illustration
shows them all “bundled” together with a bow.
LEWIS RANIERI (CONT’D)
Suddenly the yield goes up and the
risk is still low cause it’s a
mortgage and who the hell doesn’t
pay their mortgage?
BOND TRADER
Dickheads and junkies.
LEWIS RANIERI
And because the risk is hedged
these bonds allow for people with
not so perfect credit to get homes.
So you’re making money and you’re
doing a good thing.
BOND TRADER #2
Lewie is a fucking genius.
FUND MANAGER
Uhm, what exactly is the credit
rating on this bond? All my pension
fund cares about is triple A rated
risk.

LEWIS RANIERI
Risk? What risk? The only risk is
that you get paid back too soon!
Plus each of these mortgages is
guaranteed by the U.S. Government.
This bond gentlemen, is AAA rated.
FUND MANAGER
This is exactly what the Michigan
State pension fund has been looking
for. I’ll buy 20 million...

MODERN TRADER (V.O.)
Lewis and his band of foul mouthed
bond traders took a sleepy
department and made it the most
profitable on Wall Street. Pretty
soon stocks and savings were almost
inconsequential to the big banks.
They were doing 50, 100, 200

SCARLETT JOHANSSON in a white T shirt and cut off jeans let’s

securities.
SCARLETT JOHANSSON
Basically Lewis Ranieri’s Mortgage
bonds were amazingly profitable for
the big banks. They made billions
and billions off of their 2% fee on
each of these bonds they sold. But
then they started running out of
mortgages to put in them. After
all, there’s only so many homes and
so many people with good enough
jobs to buy them. So the banks
starting doing something different.
Instead of creating mortgage bonds
that were guaranteed by the US
government, they started creating
their own private mortgage bonds.
No government, no pesky standards
like good credit or minimum income.
And then the big banks were able to
fill the bonds with riskier and
riskier mortgages and keep the
profit machine churning. By the
way, the risky mortgages are called
“subprime.” Anytime you hear
subprime, think shit.

mortgage bonds that we supposedly
65% AAA were actually mostly full

side of the blocks is written the ratings of the tiers AAA,

JARED VENNETT (CONT’D)
This is a basic mortgage bond. The
original ones were simple,
thousands of AAA mortgages bundled
together and sold with a guarantee
from the US government. But the
modern day ones are private and are
made up of layers of tranches, with
the AAA highest rated getting paid
first and the lowest, B rated
getting paid last and taking on
defaults first.

B and BB level tranches went from
risky to dog shit. I’m talking rock
bottom Fico scores, no income

VINNY
So you’re offering us the chance to
short that pile of blocks? How?

With something called a credit
default swap. It’s like insurance
on the bond. And if it goes bust
you can make a 10 to 1, even 20 to
1 return. And it’s already slowly
going bust. But no one’s paying
attention cause all the banks are
busy getting paid obscene amounts
of fees selling these bonds.

Five-hundred? You want us to pay a

Good for you. That was two months

So you’re pricing the swaps like

*
*
*

CROWD
She can’t lose! That’s seven hands
in a row!

SELENA GOMEZ
So here’s how a synthetic CDO
works. Let’s say I make a bet of 10
million on a black jack hand...

*
*
*
*

DR. THALER
10 million because this hand
represents a simple mortgage bond.

*
*
*

She is dealt a Jack and an 8 by the dealer.

*

DR. THALER (CONT’D)
Selena is showing 18 and the dealer
is showing a seven. So the odds are
very much in Selena’s favor. 87% to
be exact. Which are like the great
odds most perceived the housing
market to have.

So my odds are great. And I am on a
winning streak. Everyone else here
wants in on this. I can’t lose,
right?

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

DR. THALER
We have done countless studies that
show that people often make this
error in their thinking. If
something is happening-- like
Selena winning seven hands in a row

*
*
*
*
*
*

SELENA GOMEZ
Or the housing market going up for
seven years straight...

*
*
*

DR. THALER
Exactly. They think it will go on
forever. It’s called extrapolation
bias. People see something
happening and they extrapolate that
it will continue to happen.

*
*
*
*
*
*

SELENA GOMEZ
So the people who are watching and
think I can’t lose will make a side
bet which is the first CDO.

*
*
*
*

We see A WOMAN IN GLASSES standing behind SELENA. She turns
to a BUSINESS MAN.

*
*

WOMAN IN GLASSES
Wow. I love Selena Gomez. And she’s
won seven in a row with a seven
showing for the dealer. I bet you
50 million she wins and I’ll give
you three to one odds.

*
*
*
*
*
*

3 to 1 odds? Okay, I’ll take that
bet.

bet on their bet with someone else.

DR. THALER
This happens all the time. In the
stock market. In sports. In
basketball, they call the Hot Hand
fallacy. A player hits 3 shots in a
row and everyone thinks he is
definitely going to make that 4th
one. We know, from a lot of
statistical evidence, that there is
no such thing as hot hands, but
people refuse to accept that.

We see a LONG LINE OF PAIRS OF PEOPLE making bets of
increasing value and complexity that stretches behind Selena
and Dr. Thaler at the table down the hall and around the
corner and out of the doors of the casino.

And then the dealer plays out his
hand.
The dealer turns over a 3, giving him 10 and then turns over
a King. DEALER WINS.

Danny squints at his screens; something's wrong with his

DANNY (CONT'D)
I think I'm having a heart attack.
PORTER
No, you're not.
He's extremely pale but doesn't walk from the desk, tries to
regulate his breathing as Porter and Vinny watch.

Charlie and Jamie walk through the destruction: plundered

On one wall, someone's painted a huge...LEH: 0.00.

And then over black...
“When the dust settled from the collapse 5 trillion dollars
in pension money, real estate value, 401k, savings, and bonds
had disappeared. 8 million people lost their jobs, six
million lost their homes. And that was just in the USA.”
“Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley attempted to sue the
ratings agencies but were laughed out of all law offices.
Jamie still runs Brownfield with Ben Rickert but Charlie left
New York to live in Charlotte and start a family. He did not
go on Lithium.”
“Cynthia says Mark Baum actually became gracious after the
collapse and never said “I told you so” to anyone. But he did
give large sums of his money to a charity that helps people
escape from cults. Danny, Vinny and Porter all still run a
fund together and are as terrified as ever.”
“Michael Burry contacted the government several times to see
if anyone wanted to interview him to find out how he knew the
system would collapse years before anyone else. No one ever
returned his calls. But he was audited four times and
questioned by the FBI. The small investing he still does is
all focused on one commodity: water.”
After a beat...
“In 2015 several large banks began selling billions in
something called a “bespoke tranche opportunity.” Which
according to the Wall Street Journal is just another name for
a CDO.”
