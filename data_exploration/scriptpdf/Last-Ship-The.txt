FADE IN ON

*

We’re soaring over miles of DESERT. Red, burning sand as far
as the eye can see. Desolate, the middle of nowhere.

*
*

A LOW-LEVEL HUM rises in volume as a JEEP hurtles into frame
from behind a dune.

*
*

The driver is a young AFGHANI MAN (20’s). Next to him,
RACHEL SCOTT (30’s), driven and fiercely intelligent,
searches the burnt horizon and points.

*
*
*

The Driver turns, the Jeep fishtails, sending a plume of dirt
in its wake. As it bounds down the rocky terrain, REVEAL...

...a REFUGEE CAMP, set into the barren desert.

The driver skids to a halt.

*
*
Rachel hops out, warning him:

RACHEL (CONT’D)
You go no further.

*
*
*

She moves to the trunk and pulls out a BOX.

*

QUICK CUTS: Rachel slides on a SYNTHETIC WHITE JUMPSUIT,
GLOVES, a MASK, and a RESPIRATOR.

*
*

TIME CUT TO

*

Rachel making her way through the CAMP in her BIO-HAZARD
SUIT. VILLAGERS stare in curiosity and fear. The Darth
Vader WHEEZING of the respirator fills our ears, merging with
the sounds of WAILING as she approaches then bursts into a...

*
*
*
*

LARGE TENT, where we find a half-dozen sick and dying AFGHAN
VILLAGERS, writhing under thin blankets.

*
*

A LOCAL DOCTOR in a useless surgical mask looks up to see her
approach the bed of a 30 year old PASHTUN; gaunt, sweating,
taking quick shallow breaths. His glassy eyes struggle to
focus on the vision of this extra-terrestrial standing over
his cot. He reaches out a hand.

*
*
*
*
*

Rachel pulls his arm toward her and PLUNGES a NEEDLE into it.
He panics at the sight of his own blood filling the syringe,
but within moments, Rachel withdraws the syringe and rests
the man's arm next to his frail body.

*
*
*
*

I’m sorry.

RACHEL (CONT’D)

CUT TO

*

A FLUTTERING OF WINGS as SEA GULLS scatter to reveal...

*

NAVAL STATION NORFOLK, VIRGINIA. Seen from ABOVE to
establish. A sprawling complex of NAVY SHIPS and BARRACKS.

*
*

CUT TO

*

A LONE FIGURE, silhouetted by the bright sky at the end of an
exterior passageway (P-WAY) as he marches purposefully toward
the FORECASTLE of the USS NATHAN JAMES. From his posture and
his gait, you can tell he’s a man of considerable power.

*
*
*
*

He emerges into the light and we meet TOM CHANDLER (40’S),
rugged, determined. His face softens at the sight of...

*
*

Dad!

SAM

SAM (6) and ASHLEY (9) racing toward him.
DARIEN, Tom’s wife, who smiles sadly.

*
*
Behind them stands

CHANDLER
What do you think? Pretty cool,
huh?
Way cool!

SAM

CHANDLER
C’mere. We don’t have much time.
I got something for y’all.
He kneels, shows them two GOLD COINS.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

CHANDLER (CONT’D)
See this. The USS Nathan James.
That’s us. And here, this spear.
It’s what they call us. The “Spear
of the Navy.” Cause we’re the best
ship in the sea.

*
*
*
*
*
*

SAM
Does that mean you’re the best
Captain?

*
*
*

CHANDLER
I’d better be, right?

*
*

SAM
Are you gonna get to shoot people?

*
*

3.
CHANDLER
Navy’s mission is to help people,
son. I’ve told you -- we only have
the guns for protection.
Chandler sees Ashley moping.

*
*
*
*
*

CHANDLER (CONT’D)
What do you say, Princess?

*
*

ASHLEY
(unenthused)
Thanks, Dad.

*
*
*

SAM
Let’s go check out the big gun!

*
*

DARIEN
Five minutes, kids!

*
*

Sam races off towards the large MK45, Ashley trailing behind.
As Darien comes up and puts her arms around Chandler...

*
*

CHANDLER
Ashley’s not happy with me.

*
*

DARIEN
She’s gonna miss her daddy.

*
*

They turn to see Sam gesticulate excitedly about the big gun.
DARIEN (CONT’D)
On the other hand, I think Sam’s
ready to enlist.
Chandler smiles, but his expression is pained.

*
*
*
*
*

CHANDLER
Fleet Command just called. The
mission’s changed. Navy wants the
weapons tested under conditions of
extreme cold.

*
*
*
*
*

DARIEN
You’re not going to the Med.

*
*

CHANDLER
The Arctic.

*
*

DARIEN
And we’re not meeting in Mykonos
for our anniversary.

*
*
*

4.
CHANDLER
Gets worse. We’ll be EMCON Alpha
the whole tour. Total radio
silence.

*
*
*
*

DARIEN
Wait...you won’t even be able to
check in? No Skype, no email?

*
*
*

CHANDLER
Two minutes on the HF per week.
Otherwise, we’re dark.

*
*
*

DARIEN
I’ve never heard of anything like
this.

*
*
*

CHANDLER
It happens. Not often, but -- it’s
a classified mission, I can’t even
tell you exactly where we’ll be.
(off her upset)
This all fell into my lap twenty
minutes ago. I haven’t even been
briefed on all the details myself.

XO MIKE SLATTERY (40’s) walking XO MIKE SLATTERY (40’s)
walking on the FLIGHT DECK, crossing with NAVY SEALS DANNY
GREEN and FRANKIE BENZ (both 20’s). He shakes Danny’s hand.

*
*
*

SLATTERY
Dan the man! I heard the Seals
were on board. What gives?

*
*
*

DANNY
Damned if we know.

*
*

SLATTERY
That’s six extra bodies, anybody
alert the kitchen?

*
*

Frankie reveals the Seal Dog (ADMIRAL NELSON), on a leash.

FRANKIE
And he eats for two.

Seven.

The SOUND of a CHOPPER OFF-CAMERA draws Slattery’s attention.
SLATTERY

Slattery strides toward the HELO BAY, a Chopper rising into
the air behind him.
SLATTERY (CONT’D)
(yelling into the bay)
Where my helo going? Who the hell
are you?
REVERSE to REVEAL Rachel unloading boxes of scientific
equipment in the HELO BAY. Behind her, her assistant QUINCY
TOPHET (40’s) sets up their make-shift BIO LAB.

RACHEL
Dr. Rachel Scott.
(handing him papers)
Department of Defense authorized us
moving in here for the tour.

*
*
*
*
*

SLATTERY
And you’re going to be playing
house in my helo bay?

*
*
*

RACHEL
I apologize. It was the only place
that could accommodate our needs.

*
*
*

SLATTERY
And what is it you do exactly?

*
*

RACHEL
We’re paleomicrobiologists.

*
*

SLATTERY
Well that clears everything up.

*
*

Slattery notices BIO-HAZARD SUITS hanging along the wall.

*

SLATTERY (CONT’D)
I got 217 men and women aboard this
ship -- and a dog. Anything I
should be concerned about?

*
*
*
*

RACHEL
Oh, that’s just so we don’t
contaminate the work. Not the
other way around.
(ending this)
We really appreciate you giving us
a lift.

*
*
*
*
*
*
*

SLATTERY
Don’t thank me. It wasn’t my idea.

Quincy watches Slattery go.

QUINCY
Nobody told these guys anything?
A beat.

The weight of the world on her.
RACHEL
Come on, let’s finish up.

As Rachel goes to get more supplies, Quincy reaches into a
box and pulls out a CAGE -- filled with MICE.

CUT TO

Sam on the FORECASTLE, looking at the coin.

DARIEN (O.S.)
What are you going to tell the
kids?
RESUME WITH Chandler and Darien:

*
*
*
*

CHANDLER
I was hoping I could sell them on
the idea that I’ll be hanging out
with Santa. Maybe put a good word
in for them.

*
*
*
*
*

DARIEN
They don’t believe in Santa any
more.

*
*
*

CHANDLER
Since when?

*
*

DARIEN
Since the last time you were at sea
for Christmas.

*
*
*

CHANDLER
I’ll make it this year.

*
*

Promise?

DARIEN

HELMSMAN TIM SPARKS, (20’s) and OFFICER OF THE DECK ALISHA
GRANDERSON (20’s, African-American) steer the ship. Everyone
wears cumbersome cold-weather jackets.

*
*
*

Slattery enters from outside, unzipping his heavy coat.

*

SLATTERY
Goddamn it’s cold. I can’t feel my
face. Lieutenant Granderson, tell
me: Do I still have a face?

*
*
*
*

ALISHA
Yes, sir. Though it looks like you
could use some lip balm. Sir.

*
*
*

SLATTERY
I should’ve taken the desk job in
Miami. Goddamn it’s cold!

*
*
*

Chandler enters.
QUARTERMASTER
Captain on the Bridge!

*
*

ALISHA
Captain, we’re all set for the
weapons test.

*
*
*

Chandler takes his starboard-side seat and scans the dark sea
with his BINOCULARS.
CHANDLER
Thank you, Lieutenant. Commander
Slattery, our Helo just dropped a
target somewhere within a 30 mile
radius. The target is five feet
long, two feet wide and in the icy
water it has no heat signature.
Let’s see if we can kill this thing
and get your frozen ass back to
Norfolk.
Off Slattery’s smile...
JACKIE MAKENA (PRELAP)
Aye Aye, sir.

The CIC - where LT. JACKIE MAKENA (20’s) and her team scan
the ocean for the target. Chandler next to her. Slattery
behind them.
JACKIE MAKENA (CONT’D)
Target area acquired.
Fire.

CHANDLER

Jackie hits the button on her console and...
ON DECK - a VLS LAUNCHER BAY OPENS and a MISSILE launches.
BACK IN THE CIC, we track the missile over the sea. From the
animated image of the MISSILE on the screen, we go to
The sky, FLYING WITH THE MISSILE. From this POV, we see the
missile’s tip and the sea racing below us at hundreds of mph.
BACK IN THE CIC, Everyone anxiously watches the monitors.
Suddenly, the missile appears to take a hard right turn.
JACKIE MAKENA
Impact in 3...2...
A silent explosion on the monitors.
Boom.

CHANDLER

JACKIE MAKENA
Confirmed, Sir. Target destroyed.
Off Jackie’s relieved smile, Chandler reaches for the 1MC
(ship’s public address system).
CHANDLER
(on Mic)
Attention crew of the Nathan James.
This is your Captain speaking. We
just passed our final test. Bravo
Zulu to each and every one of you
Blue Noses.
WHOOPS from the team in the CIC and...
IN THE BRIDGE...where Alisha and her crew cheer.
HELMSMAN
(to no one in particular)
This mean we’re going home?
BACK IN THE CIC -

CHANDLER
Nice job, Lt. Makena.
JACKIE MAKENA
Thank you, sir.
Captain.

SLATTERY (O.S.)

Chandler turns to see Slattery standing by another monitor,
which shows a LIVE VIDEO FEED of the SNOW-COVERED ISLAND a
few hundred yards off the Ship’s stern.
ON VIDEO: Silhouetted by the setting sun, two small FIGURES
stand on the ice. They wear the same bio-hazard suits Rachel
was wearing in Afghanistan, and they’re surrounded by
THOUSANDS of BIRDS soaring above them.
CHANDLER
Lieutenant, what time is sunset
today?
JACKIE MAKENA
12:36, sir.
SLATTERY
It’s going to drop to 50 below.
CHANDLER
Get them off the ice.
CUT TO
A SEA BIRD waddling on the ICE. Reverse to reveal Rachel, in
her suit, slowly sneaking up on the bird.
RACHEL
Here, little bird.

Here, here.

Behind Rachel, another suited person (QUINCY TOPHET, 40’s)
kneels over the ice, assaying the water.
QUINCY
If this is the place, we’ll need to
dig deeper to get a better
concentration. Come back tomorrow
if the weather holds.
Rachel’s not listening; she’s intent on catching the bird.
Rachel...

QUINCY (CONT’D)

10.
She takes three ginger steps, trying not to crunch on the ice
when -A BUZZING NOISE sends the bird flying.
Damn it!!

RACHEL

She turns to see two WHITE SNOW MOBILES, racing towards them.
The snow mobiles catch air and slide to a stop just feet away
from Rachel. The driver in front takes off his helmet, and we
reveal Danny. Next to him is Frankie.
DANNY
Ma’am. CO says I need to get you
back on the ship. Now.
RACHEL
You can tell the Captain that I
know how to find the ship, and I’ll
return when I’m ready.
FRANKIE
It wasn’t an invitation, ma’am.
Off Rachel, pissed...
CUT TO
THE SEA - 1800 (Six PM) - The waters are calm. The stars burn
with a white luster in a pitch black sky.
CLOSE UP of A MOUSE -- A rubber-gloved HAND picks it up.
Another HAND injects it with a syringe.
WIDEN TO REVEAL the converted HELO BAY/BIO-LAB, filled with
all sorts of scientific equipment. Rachel pets the mouse and
places it inside a GLASS CASE with FOUR OTHER MICE. As she
removes her mask, deadly serious...
A PSSSSSH takes us to the...
DECONTAMINATION SHOWER OUTSIDE the LAB. Rachel stands naked
in the hot, high-pressure shower, the jets pounding away at
her from all angles, high-grade disinfectant soap washing
over her.
CUT TO
The MESS DECK, where the crew of the James enjoy a hot meal.
Follow Navy SEAL Frankie Benz to find Alisha and CMC Jeter
shooting it out on a “Call of Duty” type video game.

ALISHA
I got you pinned. Come out nice and
easy. I promise, you won’t suffer.
CMC JETER
I’m not going down without a fight.
FRANKIE
(to Alisha)
May I?
She hands him the gun controller.
CMC JETER
Aw, what’s Frankie gonna doInstantly, Frankie puts a bullet through a crack in the wall - holstering it as CMC Jeter’s avatar stumbles out and dies.
Jeter glowers playfully at Frankie, who smiles a mile wide
and moves on, past...
THE HEAD, where Propulsion Engineer LT JG GLENN CHUNG (22),
pukes in a TOILET. SMITH and ROWLER (20’s) pass by.
ROWLER
Jesus Christ, Chung. Four months
underway and you’re still sea sick.
CHUNG
It’s just something I ate.
He throws up again.
SMITH
Man, I pity the guy who bunks under
you.
CUT TO
Lt. Jackie Makena walking down a P-WAY. She spots the SEAL
DOG, sitting at attention by the sick bay door.
JACKIE MAKENA
Admiral Nelson! How are ya, boy?
You being a good boy?
As Jackie approaches the dog, a hand reaches out and grabs
her, pulling her into the
SICK BAY - It’s Danny.
JACKIE MAKENA (CONT’D)
Not fair, using the Admiral as
bait!

DANNY
All’s fair in love and war.
He starts to kiss her.
JACKIE MAKENA
(kissing back)
Danny!

It’s fine.

DANNY

JACKIE MAKENA
If somebody sees us...
DANNY
Nobody’s gonna see us.
Jackie kisses him one last time and pushes him off. Off his
wounded expression, she smiles and caresses his cheek.
JACKIE MAKENA
We’re almost home.
CUT TO
Chandler and Slattery on a walk-and-talk through a P-WAY.
SLATTERY
We haul ass from here, we should
make it back for the Series.
CHANDLER
You’re not really thinking the Cubs
are still in it.
SLATTERY
They were six games up when we
left.
CHANDLER
That was June. And they’re the
Cubs.
As they reach the entrance to the WARD ROOM, a freshlyshowered, wet-haired Rachel intercepts them.
RACHEL
Captain Chandler - You had no right
to pull me from my work!
Slattery backs away:

she’s all yours.

SLATTERY
I’m just gonna check the, uh...

Sending your goons to get me.
I nearly lost a box of
samples. My work is vital
here and I’ve finally found
what I’m looking for --

Doctor!

CHANDLER
Those “goons” are SEALs - the
Navy’s finest - and the only
reason they’re even here is
to protect you so you can do
whatever it is you’re doing.
Doctor-

CHANDLER

She stops.
CHANDLER (CONT’D)
First of all, thanks for checking
in. This is the first time you’ve
said more than three words to me in
four months.
RACHEL
I’m sorry I haven’t had you over
for tea.
He holds up a hand to stop her.
CHANDLER
- Still talking. Now, I think I’ve
been more than a gracious host. I
gave up an airship so you could
convert one of my helo bays into a
floating mad scientist’s lab and
I’ve taxied you and your assistant
around the islands here so you can
chase ducks -RACHEL
Yellow Wagtails.
CHANDLER
And I’ve tried not to let it bother
me that I was ordered to take you
on board without a clue as to the
nature of your work here.
RACHEL
It’s classified. By orders from
the Pentagon--

He holds up a hand again.
CHANDLER
You need to wrap it up. Our
mission’s done and we’ll be headed
back to Norfolk.
RACHEL
I don’t think so.
She walks off...
CHANDLER
Whose ship do you think you’re on?
She keeps walking.

Off Chandler, what the fuck?

CUT TO
The AUXILIARY RADIO ROOM - Chandler smacks the side of the
HF radio transceiver, keeping an eye on the DIGITAL CLOCK
counting down the time he has remaining to speak.
CHANDLER (CONT’D)
We have a noisy channel. I repeat:
Mission objectives achieved. We’re
ready to come home. Over.
A beat. Static. The clock ticks down. 20..19..18...
Chandler leans in. Is anyone there? After a beat...
VOICE
That’s a negative, Commander. The
mission has been extended. Over.
11...10...9...
Extended?

CHANDLER
Why?

VOICE
Maintain your current position
until you receive further
instructions in seven days.
The clock reaches zero and the connection breaks.

What’s up, Danny boy?
DANNY
Same same water buffalo.
FRANKIE
We should’ve been outta here a week
ago.
DANNY
Ours is not to reason why...
CUT TO
RACHEL’S LAB. Under the garish flourescents, the empty lab
is eerily quiet. We PUSH through the plastic-lined walls and
PAN ACROSS the lab equipment, coming to rest on the SEALED
RODENT CAGE, where ALL FOUR MICE LIE DEAD.
ON THE BRIDGE - Chandler watches Rachel and Quincy through
BINOCULARS. Rachel DRILLS into the snow bank. Quincy
collects more water.
ON THE ICE - Rachel places a VIAL in a SAMPLE BOX, next to
three other vials of liquid.
On the VIALS, starting to VIBRATE as...
A low frequency RUMBLE grows in volume and intensity.
Rachel and Quincy look at each other -- and then see...
THREE RUSSIAN ATTACK HELICOPTERS bursting over the horizon.
Oh, God.

RACHEL

BACK ON THE SHIP
DANNY
What the hell!?
ON THE BRIDGE, ALARMS GO OFF. TWO SMALLER TROOP CARRIERS
appear, joining the three attack helos.
JACKIE MAKENA
Captain. I have three -- make that
five -- unknown aircraft coming in
hot from 010 and 035.

CHANDLER
General Quarters!
CUT TO
THE ICE - The Russian attack HELOS race toward the James. The
others bank toward Rachel and Quincy. Rachel restarts her
drill and tries to get back to work.
Rachel -

QUINCY

RACHEL
Almost there.
ON THE BRIDGE - Chandler stares down the incoming helos.
CHANDLER
Get SCAT team ready. CIWS
(see-whiz) set to AW Auto.
Hold Fire ON!

SLATTERY
(on a radio)
I repeat. This is the XO of
the USS Nathan James.
Identify yourself.

JACKIE MAKENA
(looking through scope)
They’re Russian, sir. Confirmed,
the helos are Russian.
CHANDLER
Send the SEALS.
ALISHA
Missile incoming!
They look through the front windshield to see an AIR-LAUNCHED
MISSILE fast approaching.
CHANDLER
Prepare chaff! Launch!
ON THE FORECASTLE DECK - DECOY CANNONS explode, sending
thousands of METALLIC SHARDS into the air, away from the
ship. Drawn by the flying metal, the Russian Missile veers
away from the James and safely explodes over the water.
The concussion of the blast rocks the ship.
CHANDLER (CONT’D)
Take ‘em out.
IN THE CIC - a flurry of activity as the crew shoots a
RUSSIAN HELO out of the SKY.

17.
ON THE ICE - Quincy and Rachel watch the helo explode, then
turn to see another RUSSIAN HELO hovering over the ice a
hundred yards away. A ROPE LINE drops and FOUR MEN IN BLACK - wearing RESPIRATOR MASKS -- drop down to the snow with
ASSAULT RIFLES around their necks.
Rachel tosses the drill aside, drops to her knees and shovels
away the remaining snow, trying to get to the DIRT below.
QUINCY
Rachel, come on!
She grabs a pile of DIRT and stuffs it into a SAMPLE BOX.
QUINCY (CONT’D)
There’s no time!
You go.

RACHEL
I’m right behind you!

CUT TO
THE SKY, as another Russian Helo fires on the James.
IN THE BRIDGE JACKIE MAKENA
We’re taking hits!
The Russian HELO buzzes right over the FLIGHT DECK, chased
down by the James’s machine guns.
ON THE ICE, the Russians close in on Rachel and Quincy.
Rachel grabs the SAMPLE BOX and runs.
fires a warning shot.

One of the Russians

QUINCY
Rachel, Rachel! Stop.
No.

No!

RACHEL
Keep running!

Crack! Another shot as a HELO races to cut Rachel off.
QUINCY
If they wanted to kill us they’d
have done it already. It’s the
samples they want!
Russians close in all sides, the men pointing their ASSAULT
RIFLES and shooting at the ICE around Quincy and Rachel.

18.
A RUSSIAN raises his rifle and gets Rachel in his sights.
His finger closes around the trigger, squeezing...and then...
BAM! He’s killed where he stands by...
FRANKIE, who sits behind DANNY on a racing SNOW MOBILE.
Behind them are Smith and Rowler, who exchange gunfire with
the Russians.
The James’s SH-60 Romeo HELO swoops in and shoots the second
troop carrier down. It veers and crashes in the sea. The
remaining gun ships engage with our Helo.
THE BRIDGE.

Chandler hears the HELO PILOT over the comm.

We’re hit!

HELO PILOT (V.O.)
We’re hit!

Jackie fires rounds at the Russians on the ice, letting the
SH-60 Romeo beat a smoky retreat.
IN THE CIC - COMMS OFFICER MASON watches the video screen,
gets on the radio.

starboard side. 200 meters.
ON THE ICE, Rowler jumps off his snow mobile and lifts an
RPG, firing at the second Russian helo - blowing it to bits.
Danny nearly takes a bullet, kills another Russian as Rachel
and Quincy run from the FIRE FIGHT. They reach the end of a
PATCH OF ICE. Bullets behind them, FREEZING WATER in front.
THE BRIDGE. Chandler spies the last RUSSIAN HELO bearing
down towards Rachel and Quincy on the ICE.
CHANDLER
Jackie, go to the 5 inch!
JACKIE MAKENA
Okay, Boris. Game over.
(as she lines up her shot)
Come on. Come on...
ON THE ICE, Quincy puts himself between Rachel and the
shooters. She looks between RUSSIAN HELO and the icy water.
Should I jump?
The Russian Helo gets to within 100 feet, and....
BAM!
The Russians are BLOWN out of the SKY. METAL and GLASS
rain down over Rachel, knocking her hard to the ICE.

SMASH CUT TO
Danny and Frankie carrying Rachel onto DECK, Quincy by her
side. She’s bleeding badly. Chandler rushes toward Rachel CMC JETER

Captain!

CMC Jeter points out Smith and Rowler dragging a dying
RUSSIAN SOLDIER onto the DECK.
Chandler hurries over, pulls
the Russian up, and RIPS off his RESPIRATOR MASK.
CHANDLER
Kto Ti? Shto khoteetye?

Otvet’tye!

Choking on his own blood, the Russian pleads...
RUSSIAN SOLDIER
Le...chen...ieh.
The Russian DIES.

Chandler releases him, turns to Slattery.

SLATTERY
What did he say?
The cure.

CHANDLER
He wants the cure.

RACHEL (CONT’D)
Fourteen months ago, outside Dar Es
Salaam Tanzania, there was an
outbreak. A virus of unknown
origin. It quickly swept through
the village, killing everyone it
infected. Six weeks later, in
rural Bangladesh, it reappeared
with similar results. The CDC and
W.H.O wanted to sample the virus
from the victims to create a
vaccine. But I saw how fast the
virus was mutating and believed we
needed to find the primordial
strain at its source. Here, in the
arctic.
CHANDLER
The birds...

22.
RACHEL
The birds were the carriers. The
virus came from deep within the
permafrost, where it lay dormant
for hundreds of thousands of years.
As the earth warmed, this ancient
microbe was released into the
atmosphere, where the birds picked
it up and spread it to the human
population. That was my theory,
anyway. And I convinced the D.O.D.
to give me a chance to find the
strain.
CHANDLER
(re: sample case)
And this is it?
RACHEL
(nods)
We finally found the feeding ground
where the birds picked up the virus.
CHANDLER
How fast is it spreading?
RACHEL
When we left Norfolk four months
ago, the virus was at Phase 2.
Limited to small clusters of
communities in Asia and parts of
Africa.
How fast?!

CHANDLER

RACHEL
We’re at Phase Six -- Global
Pandemic.
(beat)
It’s moving faster than anyone
could have imagined. Like nothing
we’ve seen before.
CHANDLER
You’re telling me the whole world’s
dying and they send two people to
save it?
RACHEL
Like I said, most of my colleagues
thought I was crazy.

23.

Are you?

CHANDLER

RACHEL
No. And the scientists back home
aren’t making any progress. What
you have in your hand there may be
the only hope.
He sits down, reeling, absorbing the magnitude of what he’s
just been told. Thinking about his family.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry you had to find out this
way. Orders came from the White
House. It was a matter of national
security.
CHANDLER
Well there was a breach somewhere.
We were radio silent and the
Russians still found us.
RACHEL
I don’t know how that happened.
I’ve been talking to my people on
the HF. Just like you. It should
have been secure. Now may I have
my samples back? Please.

What’s left of the federal
government is holed up two hundred
feet below the White House and
communication is getting spotty, so
I need to know -- now -- Does Dr.
Scott have what she needs to make a

CHANDLER
She thinks so, ma’am.
We hear MUFFLED SIGHS OF RELIEF and “Thank Gods” from whoever
is with the President.
PRESIDENT GELLER
Good. That’s good.

We’re sending you the coordinates

Russia no longer has a functioning
government. From what we’re
hearing, two Speznat divisions
broke off under General Vladimir
Bulakov. We think they might be
the ones responsible for the
attacks -- though we’re trying to
ascertain the facts ourselves.

Chandler walks off to the edge of the DECK, off on his own,
and stares out to sea.
Rachel approaches tentatively.
RACHEL
Captain...?
CHANDLER
You got anybody?
Excuse me?
Back home?

RACHEL
CHANDLER

RACHEL
Well, I don’t have a home, really.
I spend most of my life in the
field. But yes, I’ve got somebody.
Last I heard he was in the Sudan
covering the civil war for the AP.
CHANDLER
You get a chance to say goodbye?

43.
RACHEL
Actually, no. I never told him.
(off his look)
I compared the blood we got from
the Italian the samples I took
before we left. The virus has
mutated again. It has an extra
protein now -- which only could
have been added with human
intervention.
CHANDLER
It’s been weaponized.
RACHEL
Engineered to block the human
immune response.
CHANDLER
So this plague was an act of war.
RACHEL
Perhaps, but you’re missing the
larger point: All this virus cares
about is killing and replicating.
The engineered version lets it do
that unchecked. So it no longer
needs to mutate. Which makes it
stable and easier to defeat with a
vaccine.
CHANDLER
Then why haven’t they done it yet?
RACHEL
Because they didn’t have a
primordial sample. We do. That’s
the key.
(off Chandler)
Frankie didn’t die for nothing.
As she walks off, Chandler stares into the RISING SUN and we
FADE TO WHITE
And come up on...
The COASTLINE OF AMERICA appearing like a mirage on the
HORIZON.
Land ho!
CUT TO

WATCHMAN

44.
Sailors running to the edge of the FLIGHT DECK to get a
glimpse of America -- excited and nervous.
CUT TO
The QUARTERDECK. Chandler’s with CMC Jeter, who’s checking a
GEIGER COUNTER. Jeter turns to Chandler with a grin.
CMC JETER
Clean, Captain. If we were nuked,
it wasn’t here.
Chandler smiles, pats Jeter on the back...
MASON (PRELAP)
This is the USS Nathan James
broadcasting on all Fleet-Sat
channels. Over.
CUT TO
Mason in the COMMS ROOM behind the controls, anxious.
MASON (CONT) (CONT’D)
I repeat. This is the USS Nathan
James broadcasting over all
FleetSat channels...Is anybody out
there?
He stops, sees...a SCREEN blinking.
An Incoming Message.
MASON (CONT’D)
(picks up phone)
This is Commo. Get me the Captain.
CUT TO
Chandler hurrying down the P-WAY and into the COMMS ROOM.
MASON (CONT’D)
Sir, we just got the comms up.
This came through. A message from
POTUS.
He hands him a paper with a printed message.
CHANDLER
This is five days old.
MASON
Yes, sir. It was transmitted while
we were dark.

45.
Slattery enters.
CHANDLER
(off the note)
Connecticut’s not safe. They want
us to change course for Mayport,
Jacksonville. There’s a lab just
across the Georgia border that’s
supposed to be secure.
He hands Slattery the orders.
CHANDLER (CONT'D)
We need to confirm these orders.
(to Mason)
Get me Fleet Command.
MASON
Sir, I’ve been trying. There’s no
answer there, or at the Pentagon.
CHANDLER
Try the Presidential bunker.
Mason dials.

It rings and rings and then...

MASON
...It just died.
SLATTERY
I’ll try the lab.
Slattery picks up the phone, reading the orders, dials.
MASON
(off the screen)
Sir, there’s another message coming
through. It was transmitted at the
same time as POTUS’s. Looks like a
much bigger file. It’s an mpeg,
sir.
Slattery hangs up, shakes his head -- no answer at the lab.
CHANDLER
(to Mason)
Play it.
Mason hits a button.
On SCREEN -- Chandler’s wife DARIEN appears. Sitting on a
chair in a RUSTIC CABIN. Talking to the camera...

46.
DARIEN
Tom...it’s ah...it’s me.
your father’s cabin.
Chandler’s eyes widen.

We’re at

He sits, leans toward the screen.

DARIEN (CONT’D)
I’ve been trying to get through to
you for months, but the Navy kept
refusing...
Slattery looks at Mason, nods his head toward the door.
both exit, leaving Chandler to his private moment.
DARIEN (CONT’D)
Your father thinks he has a way to
get this message out through his
contacts at the Pentagon. I hope
that it somehow finds its way to
you. It’s October 14th today, I
have no idea when you might be
seeing this...
Chandler glances at the digital calendar on the wall.
Today’s October 23rd.
DARIEN (V.O.)
...or where you might be. The kids
are healthy -- somehow. We managed
to get out early and have been up
here for a couple of months
already. We haven’t heard anything
from your brother or sister for a
while. My um...my sister didn’t
make it.
(fighting back tears)
Neither did Kate or Ella...
(collecting herself)
The power grid is down, so we’re
running on a generator here. There
are militias roaming the area everyone’s fighting for food and
medicine...But. We’re fine. We
really are. And I really hope you
are, too.
She signals off-camera and the kids enter FRAME.
ASHLEY
Daddy, where are you?
SAM
We love you, Daddy.

We miss you.

They

47.
DARIEN
Please just...wherever you are, get
here if you can. We love you. We
love you so much.
An awkward pregnant beat and then -They’re gone.

The SCREEN goes BLUE.

Chandler wipes away a tear, relieved that they’re alive,
tormented that he’s not with them.
CUT TO
THE LAB, where Rachel and Quincy work in their BIO-HAZARD
SUITS. A BUZZ turns Rachel to the door and Chandler staring
at her from behind the glass. He holds an INTERCOM PHONE.
Rachel walks over, grabs the PHONE on her side of the SEALED
DOOR. Their VOICES sound eerie over the phone.
CHANDLER
You said you had what it takes to
make the vaccine. If you had to,
could you do it here? On the ship?
RACHEL
(warily)
The lab was never intended for
that. It’s for collecting data.
CHANDLER
But if you had to, could you?
A beat as they stare at each other.
CUT TO
Slattery in his QUARTERS, lying on his cot, looking at the
photos of his family on the mantel. His son.
A KNOCK.

He gathers himself, opens the DOOR for Chandler.
CHANDLER (CONT’D)
We still can’t find POTUS. And
there’s no answer at Mayport. We
can’t even get on-line to get any
news.
SLATTERY
If the power grids are down,
everything’s down. We’ll know
better when we get boots on the
ground.

48.
CHANDLER
Mike, we’re not going home.
now.

Not

SLATTERY
What do you mean? We have standing
orders from the President.
CHANDLER
From five days ago. If the first
lab in Connecticut isn’t secure,
why should we think we’ll have any
luck in Georgia?
SLATTERY
We won’t know til we try.
CHANDLER
Even if the lab is still running -which I highly doubt -- we don’t
have a chance in hell of getting
there from Mayport without a Helo.
Not without getting infected.
So what?

SLATTERY
We stay on the ship?

CHANDLER
We have a lab here, we have power,
and we know that none of us have
been exposed -CHANDLER
We do everything we can to
help Dr. Scott. Go back when
she’s ready. Mike -

SLATTERY
You’re counting on that
scientist and her one
assistant to save the world?!
No!

SLATTERY
Listen to yourself, Tom!
(loaded beat)
I have a family! We all have
families. I think we’ve earned the
right to get back to them. Don’t
you want to find out what happened
to Darien and your kids?
CHANDLER
(stung)
I’m still the Captain of this ship
and I’ve just laid out our mission.
I expect you to fall in line,
Commander.

Slattery stares him down.

As Chandler exits --

SLATTERY
Crew won’t stand for it, Tom.
BANG.

The door closes. Slattery, fuming, smashes a lamp.

CUT TO
The NATHAN JAMES approaching the mouth of a HARBOR in the
full light of DAY.
SUPER:

ST. JOHN’S RIVER BAY, NAVAL STATION MAYPORT, FLORIDA

A narrow little passage-way that will lead them into the
RIVER, which will carry them to the “safety” of the BASE.
ANGLE ON Various crew on the DECK, watching in yearning at
the sight of America.
CUT TO
The BRIDGE.

Chandler enters.

QUARTERMASTER
Captain’s on the Bridge.
Chandler steps forward, so he can see out over the edge, to
the mouth of the HARBOR.
They’re almost there.
BINOCULAR POV:

He grabs the Binoculars.

The MILITARY BASE.

He lowers the binocular.

No activity.

Takes a deep breath.

CHANDLER
Hard left rudder. All engines
ahead flank.
Sir?

ALISHA

CHANDLER
I have the conn. Hard left rudder.
All engines ahead flank. Now.
ALISHA
Aye Aye. Captain has the conn.
Hard left rudder. All engines

into the OCEAN from whence it came.
On the DECK, Derek Evans reacts:
No, no no.

DEREK EVANS
What the hell are we

BACK TO
The BRIDGE.
CHANDLER
Lieutenant Granderson, set a course
bearing 1-4-5.
1-4-5.

ALISHA
Aye aye, sir.

Chandler reads the eyes of Jackie, Alisha, his Helmsman and
Quartermaster. He sees their doubts and their concerns and
knows he’s got to step up.
He takes another deep breath and picks up the 1MC radio.
CHANDLER
This is your Captain speaking. We
have no contact with home and I
have good reason to believe that
the American government is no
longer functioning. The country we
all hoped we were coming back to no
longer exits. The world as we knew
it no longer exists. We left these
shores four months ago as members
of the United States Navy. But now
we are more than that. Now we are
soldiers who must serve the world.
On board this ship is the hope.
For our futures, for our families.
And for all humanity. Because on
board this ship...
CUT TO
Rachel and Quincy look up from the work in the LAB.
CHANDLER (V.O) (CONT’D)
...in that lab in our helo bay, are
the ingredients for the cure.

Lt. Chung and his fellow engineers in the ENGINE ROOM.
wipes the sweat from his brow.

Chung

CHANDLER (V.O.)
Our mission now is simple. We do
whatever it takes to stay alive -at sea...
CUT TO
Sailors on the SHIP’S FORECASTLE, watching America turn away.
In front of them is THE OPEN SEA.
CHANDLER (V.O.)
...long enough for our scientists
to do their work. To find that
cure.
CUT TO
Slattery at the STERN of the SHIP, staring at the WAKE and
America receding in the background.
CHANDLER (V.O.)
There’s an unmanned food and fuel
station in the Bahamas. That is our
destination.
BACK TO
Chandler, fighting back his own emotion:
CHANDLER
As you all know, we lost one of our
own on this mission. But I can
promise you this...
CUT TO
Danny, at his rack, putting on a fresh uniform. He stops to
look at the bunk of his best friend and the PHOTOS taped to
the wall behind the pillow.
CHANDLER (V.O.)
...Francis Benz’s sacrifice will be
remembered by everyone on this
ship.
BACK TO
CHANDLER.

52.
CHANDLER
Because we’re going to make damn
sure that it meant something.
And I can make that promise because
this is the most courageous and
resilient crew in the United States
Navy.
CUT TO
A PANNING SHOT across all the SAILORS on the Bridge. Their
expressions solemn, but filled with pride and determination.
CHANDLER (V.O.)
We will come through this together
and we will prevail...
BACK TO
CHANDLER, pouring his soul into the 1MC.
CHANDLER
As long as you believe in
yourselves as I believe in you.
He looks at his crew on the Bridge.
CHANDLER (CONT'D)
This is your Captain, signing off.
He puts down the radio and looks at his people: Alisha,
Jackie, CMC Jeter and the rest of the Bridge personnel.
Are they with him?

For a moment, it’s hard to tell.

Then...

CMC JETER
Lieutenant Granderson?!
ALISHA
Yes, Command Master Chief?
CMC Jeter looks at Chandler.
CMC JETER
Permission to salute the Captain?
ALISHA
Permission granted.
As a unit, everyone on the Bridge hops to attention and
salutes Chandler.
Chandler salutes them back.

53.
CUT TO
Chandler moving onto the QUARTER-DECK, looking out at America
as the James completes its left turn.
And then looks down to the DECK BELOW to see...
Scores of his men and women at work.
He sees Rachel come out to the DECK.
As they share a determined look.
CUT TO
The LAB. Panning across the cage of mice, the microscopes,
the slides, the Bio-Hazard suits hung on the rack, we hear
the sound of someone talking.
But we can’t recognize what’s being said.
As we get closer, we REVEAL...
...Quincy, speaking on the HF line in a hushed tone.
Moving into his CLOSE-UP, we begin to discover that...
He’s speaking Russian.
FINAL FADE OUT.
