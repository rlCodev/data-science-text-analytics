Screenplay

Based on the novel by
David Ebershoff

THE DANISH GIRL
EXT. KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, DENMARK, 1920’S, DAY
FADE IN:
A rectangle of ferociously stormy sea viewed from battered
cliffs. Silver waves are whipped by a wind that flies at us,
stinging, relentless. Somewhere, unseen in the barren
landscape, something is at its mercy - we hear the RUSTLE and
PUNCH of the weather going at it...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WOMAN’S EYE
The same scene reflected across the surface of a woman’s
brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.
INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENING
A painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)
Don't you wish you could paint like
that?
We pull out to see GERDA WEGENER’S brown eyes shift from deep
scrutiny of the painting to polite social focus as she takes
in an excited OLDER WOMAN.
GERDA
I’m sorry...?
OLDER WOMAN
I said, don't you wish you could
paint like your husband? Really - you must
be so proud...
The woman smiles and heads into the crowd, leaving Gerda to
consider... Gerda’s gaze travels across the well-dressed
gathering. Far off in a corner, there’s an inner circle
where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene RASMUSSEN, Einar’s dealer.
RASMUSSEN
They’re all Veijle, where he grew
up.

Gerda begins walking toward them through the throng...
RASMUSSEN (cont’d)
And I don't say my client is
the best landscape artist in
Denmark... but, he is in the top
one!
Einar cringes as the crowd laughs, delighted. An exoticlooking woman with mischief playing on her full lips
approaches Gerda. This is ULLA FONSMARCK. They’re friends.
ULLA
(a stage whisper)
It’s going very well.
Oh yes.

GERDA
He’ll be impossible.

The women LAUGH. As Gerda looks up, Einar looks across,
smiles, trapped in his corner. Gerda nods back, reassuring,
conspiratorial. Then Einar’s pulled back into the select
circle and Rasmussen emits a ridiculous barking LAUGH.
EXT. COPENHAGEN STREET, NIGHT
Gerda and Einar, arm in arm, LAUGHING. Gerda wears a
distinctively embroidered fine wool wrap. Their FOOTSTEPS
ring down the empty street. A patina of crystallised brine
coats doorways, windows, scintillating in the moonlight.
GERDA
And Rasmussen...
EINAR
Oh, come on. Be kind.
At least he agreed to see your work.
GERDA
Only because he was drunk!
I know.

EINAR

GERDA
You were loving it!
I was not.

EINAR

She mimics Rasmussen, his ludicrous excitement:
GERDA
“I don’t say my client is the best
landscape artist in Denmark...”

CONTINUED:
“But...”

EINAR

GERDA
“He is in the top one!”
They LAUGH hard.

Someone calls from an upstairs window:

MAN AT WINDOW
Hey - people are sleeping!
The window SLAMS. Gerda and Einar struggle to quieten down,
head for the dancing harbour lights - partners in crime.
EXT. HARBOUR, NEXT MORNING
- MAIN TITLES BEGIN Fishermen selling straight off the boats to early-rising
customers. Prices are loudly negotiated as the silver catch
still writhes and flaps. A city coming to life.
INT. THE WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
Gerda carries in a breakfast tray. Einar sleeps. She observes
his face: long eyelashes, cheeks hollow in repose, delicate
lips. A little dog, HVAPPE, trots beside her. She puts down
the tray and throws back the bedcover. Einar blinks in the
light, surprised. He stretches, takes in the silhouetted
outline of his wife: tall, purposeful Gerda.
GERDA
Do you know what time it is?
He smiles, sweetly suggestive of pleasure to come...
EINAR
Time you came back to bed?
GERDA
No - I’m ready to start work.
EINAR
Draw down the blinds.
She holds back, teases a little.
GERDA
I told you, I...
Gerda...
What?

EINAR
GERDA

CONTINUED:
She takes him in, smiling up at her.

Shakes her head.

GERDA (cont’d)
Your face... You think I can’t resist
you...
EINAR
Do you want to resist me?
She approaches the edge of the bed, smiling herself now.
GERDA
No. But I’d like you to ask nicely
so I don’t feel such a pushover...
Einar reaches towards her.
EINAR
Gerda Wegener - my life, my wife...
He pulls her into bed... A skittish piano comes up as they
laugh, begin to make love. Continues over:
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE COPENHAGEN OPERA HOUSE
Einar crosses the road, heads for the Opera House.
INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR
Einar greets the doorman, THORBJORN.
Thorbjorn.

EINAR

STAGE DOORMAN
Mr Wegener.
INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, ONE MONTH LATER, DAY
Einar walks between racks of clothes that hang in two tiers
so the ruffled and feathered hems of jewel-coloured gowns
brush his cheeks. An explicit sensual pleasure, which Einar
is conscious of but feels no need to investigate. He pauses.
The ARIA ceases, he hears women CHATTING, sometimes DROPPING
THEIR VOICES, emitting DIRTY LAUGHS, which make him smile and
wonder. A stolen intimacy. Einar spies on Ulla, below Tighter!

ULLA (O.S.)

Ulla is being pulled into a corset by a DRESSER. Einar leans
forward for a better view... She spots him - is delighted,
breaks free for a moment.

CONTINUED:
ULLA (cont’d)
Einar Wegener!
The DRESSER hands Ulla a robe to cover up, but:
ULLA (cont’d)
Oh don’t worry about him - he’s only ever
had eyes for one woman.
EINAR
My guilty secret’s out.
He smiles at her, indulgent.

She calls up to him -

ULLA
So - when are you two going to breed me a
godchild?
EINAR
You’re an atheist.
ULLA
I’ll reconsider.
EINAR
We’re trying.
ULLA
Try harder. I’ve been waiting an eternity.
Have you tried drinking raw eggs?
EINAR

No.
Do it.

ULLA
For my sake.

Einar shakes his head.

She’s impossible and he adores her.

ULLA (cont’d)
Anyway what are you doing in today? I
thought you finished last week?
EINAR
I wanted to check on the scrim for the
storm scene. And give Gerda some space.
ULLA
Ah - she’s got a shy one.
Einar nods, smiles.

Ulla prepares to resume her fitting.

ULLA (cont’d)
You know I’m next?
EINAR
So I heard.
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

6.
CONTINUED:
ULLA
I won’t be shy.
EINAR
I should imagine not.
ULLA
Good God, she’ll need all her colours for
me!
They LAUGH and Ulla signals to the dresser to pull at the
corset once more, smiles in delighted anticipation of the
discomfort to come.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY
MR FONNESBECH in a chair on a slightly raised dais. He is
formally dressed, somewhat stiff. The room is oppressively
still. Gerda looks up from her canvas, goes to adjust
Fonnesbech’s arm. He is clearly affected by being touched,
embarrassed. She returns to the canvas. After an
uncomfortable couple of moments:
FONNESBECH
I wanted to say... I appreciate our being
alone today. I hope your husband doesn’t
mind.
GERDA
Not at all. I could see his being here
made you uncomfortable.
FONNESBECH
It wasn’t personal.
Gerda smiles.

Shakes her head - he shouldn’t worry:

GERDA
It’s not uncommon.
Ah.

FONNESBECH

Fonnesbech’s relieved.

Though he’s left with questions.

GERDA
It’s hard for a man to be looked at by a
woman. Women are used to it, of course,
but for a man...
Mr Fonnesbech begins to look wildly vulnerable.
GERDA (cont’d)
To... submit to a woman’s gaze.
unsettling...

It’s

Fonnesbech nods, relieved - that’s exactly it.

GERDA (cont’d)
Although I believe there’s some pleasure to
be had from it, once you...
She smiles mischievously.
GERDA (cont’d)

...yield.

Fonnesbech swallows, cheeks pinking.

Suddenly:

GERDA (cont’d)

Sit!
Fonnesbech flinches.

The dog settles.

Good girl.

Fonnesbech exhales.

GERDA (cont’d)

Gerda returns to work, eyes glinting at what she’s revealed
in her sitter: finally getting somewhere.
EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, MONTHS LATER
A CHINESE LAUNDRESS with a large wheeled cart makes her way
along the street, RINGING a pair of little BELLS as she goes.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING
Einar quickly but carefully folds Gerda’s chemise and puts it
in a bag of laundry, hurries to open the door...
INT/EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, A MONTH LATER
Einar hands the bag to the laundress as she passes.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
Gerda at the mirror, putting on her lipstick. Einar comes
in, reacts, seeing her dressed up. She’s self-conscious.
Well?

GERDA

Einar can’t help smiling at her implied self-criticism.
Perfect.

EINAR
Almost.

He approaches, uses his thumb to gently blend away a smudge
of lipstick from her bottom lip. He nods. Perfect now.
EINAR (cont’d)
Good luck...

EXT. BUSY COPENHAGEN STREET, DAY
Gerda carries her heavy portfolio, optimistic, brisk.
INT. ART DEALER’S OFFICE, DAY
Rasmussen’s face - a look of slight distaste. A sea of
Gerda’s work, on the desk, the floor - competent but
uninspiring naturalistic depictions of society figures.
RASMUSSEN
All portraits...
Gerda hesitates a beat, the fact being so self-evident.
GERDA
Is that bad?
RASMUSSEN
Not per se, but... this kind of work is not
really my...
He winces a little.

He has to end this:

RASMUSSEN (cont’d)
Gerda... I don’t think it would benefit
either of us to show these.
A vein begins to throb in Gerda’s neck.
RASMUSSEN (cont’d)
It’s not a judgement on your abilities - I
agree with Einar: you could be a first
class painter if you found the right
subject matter.
It’s the first time Gerda’s heard this.
stung, betrayed.

Her eyes shine,

INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAY
Einar works, hears the door. Gerda brings in the portfolio,
sets it down, starts taking off her coat. Einar’s tentative:
EINAR
How was it?
Fine.

GERDA

He waits for more, but nothing comes.
EINAR
I finally mixed the right colour for the
snow.

26/11/15

9.
CONTINUED:
Gerda glances at the canvas, hostile.
GERDA
Another view of Vejle. I don’t know how
you can paint the same thing over and over.
Einar misses a beat.
EINAR
I suppose I just haven’t finished with it
yet.
Gerda heads towards the door.
Gerda..?

EINAR (cont’d)

GERDA
Could you please not speak to Rasmussen
about me again... My work is my business.
Stay out of it.
But she disappears into the bedroom, the door slamming
emphatically behind her. Einar’s left bewildered.
INT. BEDROOM, DAY
Gerda’s already regretting the exchange with Einar. She
unfastens her dress, pulls it off. There’s a bloodstain in
her underwear. Damn! She breathes.
INT. STUDIO, DAY
Einar working as Gerda reappears. She’s composed now,
refocused, approaches her easel, organises her paints.
steals a look at her, but says nothing. Works on.
Eventually:

Einar

GERDA
I have my period.
I’m sorry.
Are you?

EINAR (O.S.)
GERDA

She turns to find him approaching.
EINAR
Of course I am... You know I am.
A moment of quiet intimacy between them. Gerda shies away,
returns to present concerns... her work...

(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

10.
CONTINUED:
GERDA
Could you help me with something?
Einar’s relieved to be able to help.
Anything.

EINAR

GERDA
Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled
again. Would you try on her stockings and
shoes?
Einar’s discomfort erupts in a laugh.

Is she serious?

GERDA (cont’d)
I’m just so behind. I don’t know how I’ll
be finished in time for her opening...
But he cuts her off:
EINAR
I’ll do it. It’s fine.
Gerda sets a shoebox and the stocking on the sitter’s chair,
goes into the kitchen. Einar moves the box and stockings,
sits in the chair on the dais. The dog leaps up EINAR (cont’d)
No... no, not now Hvappe...
He pushes Hvappe down, tests the mesh of the stockings between his
fingers. He rolls up his trousers.
EINAR (cont’d)
He almost snagged this...
Gerda marvels at his delicacy. Scolds the dog:
Hvappe...
Gerda mixes paints.

GERDA
Einar battles with the stockings.

GERDA (cont’d)
That’s backwards...
He fiddles with the second stocking now, a light sweat dewing
his forehead by the time he’s rolled both to the knee. He
opens a shoebox: - the yellow pair from the shop window.
EINAR
I saw these in the window of
Fonnesbech’s...
GERDA
Smart aren’t they?
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

11.
CONTINUED:
EINAR
I don’t think they’ll fit...
GERDA
Well just do what you can.
He takes them out... Something catches in Einar’s throat as
he pushes his toes into the shoe. Gerda’s eyes are narrow as
she starts work. Einar looks down at his feet, partly
contained in the yellow suede, the disjuncture between the
body above and below the knee... he breathes... can’t keep
his hands steady. Then:
No.

GERDA (cont’d)
I need the dress.

They both look over to where Ulla’s dress hangs. It is white,
weighted with beads at the hem and cuff. Beautiful.
EINAR
Gerda, I’m not putting it on.
GERDA
I haven’t asked you to.
She get sit... lays it across him.
GERDA (cont’d)
Would you just relax...? The sooner I
start, the sooner I finish.
Einar yields reluctantly, as Gerda runs her fingers gently
down his face. Satisfied, Gerda returns to work.
Einar’s breathing feels slightly laboured now. The dress
weighs heavily. His head moves slightly, feeling it brush at
his neck. His fingers curl involuntarily around the beaded
cuff. The SOUNDSCAPE becomes heightened: the creak of
Gerda’s easel, the jangling of her bracelets, the sound of
the harbour, the wind in the ships’ riggings. These combine,
fill his head... until:
ULLA (O.S.)
Well hello, there!
Einar starts... Ulla’s in the doorway, delighted, with a huge
bunch of lilies. She starts to LAUGH, and because it’s Ulla,
Gerda LAUGHS also. The dog YAPS, excited, confused. Einar’s
disoriented. Gerda sees this, stops laughing, but...
ULLA (cont’d)
Oh, don’t worry my darling...
She hands the flowers to him, kisses him:
ULLA (cont’d)
We’re going to call you Lili...
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

12.
CONTINUED:
Einar manages to laugh now as the dog runs BARKING in
circles, Ulla’s delight banishing the day’s frustrations.
EXT. HARBOUR, NIGHT
There are lights on in the Widow House.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHT
Gerda closes the book she’s been reading, looks up to see
Einar, working, engrossed. An almost trance-like state. She
watches him a while, then approaches, rests her head against
his back. He’s comfortable with this, but works on.
GERDA
Such concentration. Sometimes when you’re
working, I think you’re going to slip
through the surface of the painting and
vanish.
He smiles a little.
GERDA (cont’d)
Sink into the bog. Like your friend’s kite
when you were a boy.
Hans.

EINAR
It was Hans’ kite I crashed.

Einar enjoys the memory for a moment.
EINAR (cont’d)
Poor Hans. He was so proud of it...
I couldn’t believe he even let me
have a turn...
GERDA
He’s probably still sitting on a
rock, sobbing his heart out.
Einar sets down his brush, turns toward her, away from his
work, smiles.
EINAR
He’s a dealer in Paris, peddling
Old Masters to rich Americans.
GERDA
Oh. So we don’t need to worry
about Hans.
EINAR
No we don’t.
He takes her in.
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

13.
CONTINUED:
GERDA
I didn’t mean to disturb you.
EINAR
That’s okay. I’ve finished.
He kisses her.
EINAR (cont’d)
And don’t worry, I won’t disappear into the
bog.
He widens his eyes, surprised at his own realisation:
EINAR (cont’d)
The bog is in me, silly.
She pushes him off, LAUGHING.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT
Einar’s in bed. Gerda pulls off her dress, looks round to
see him watching her as she lays her stockings over the chair
beside her dressing table.
What?

GERDA

EINAR
Can’t a man watch his wife get undressed?
She goes to take off her lace-edged slip, self-conscious now.
EINAR (cont’d)
That slip is new...
GERDA
You’re very observant.
EINAR
Leave it on...
She hesitates, but Einar pulls back the sheet... Gerda keeps
the slip on, climbs in beside him. He strokes her body
through the silk...
EINAR (cont’d)
It’s very pretty...
GERDA
I might let you borrow it.
Einar shrugs, rising flirtatiously to the challenge.
EINAR
I might enjoy that.
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

14.
CONTINUED:
Gerda LAUGHS, and Einar kisses her.

She teases:

GERDA
Oh really...? Is there something you’d like
to tell me?
EINAR
Why...? Is there something you’d like to
know...?
His fingers trace, quivering, over her...
GERDA
No... I’m your wife.

I know everything.

Einar thrills, pulls her on top of him, a fresh passion,
fresh risk about their union.
INT. COSTUME SHOP, LATER THAT NIGHT
A champagne cork POPS. Ulla’s triumphant first night. She’s
on magnificent form, working the room. Gerda’s portrait hangs
in pride of place. Gerda and Einar chat with a group that
includes their friends NIELS and ELSA. Ulla swoops in,
WHISPERS something in Gerda’s ear. Gerda’s eyes register
delight as she looks across at two young men on the other
side of the room.
GERDA
Both of them...?
ULLA
And at the same time!
Einar laughs.

Gerda shakes her head.

ULLA (cont’d)
Married people are so delightfully easy to
shock.
EINAR
We just pretend to be shocked because it
encourages you.
ULLA
I know. That’s why you’re the only
couple in my party for the Artists
Ball...
EINAR
Out of the question.
ULLA
Oh, I know Einar hates it, but he’ll have
to bear with us.

It would be a

EINAR
Gerda loves a scandal.
GERDA
You’ve had too much champagne.
Niels and Elsa hear this, tune in...
EINAR
Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her
ankles. An invitation to corruption.
GERDA
I don’t think anyone is likely to be
corrupted by seeing my ankles.
I was.

EINAR

The group laughs delighted by Einar’s buoyant mood.
EINAR (CONT’D) (cont’d)
The first time we met, I was leaving the
Academy, and she was on the steps,
flaunting said ankles... And she
propositioned me!
ELSA
Is that true?!
GERDA
It was a dare. But when I said hello to
him, he actually blushed! He was so shy! So
I asked him out.
ULLA
And you said yes Einar scrutinises Gerda.
EINAR
She made me. She seemed so sure.
GERDA
I was sure. I still am.
NIELS
Oh please - enough!
Elsa elbows him, turns to Gerda.

ELSA

Gerda looks at Einar.
GERDA
I don’t know...
She remembers, drawing Einar into the recollection.
GERDA (cont’d)
But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed
him... and it was the strangest thing... it
was like kissing myself.
A look between Einar and Gerda, a connection crackling.
ULLA
Well these two won’t be staying much
longer...
EINAR
Unmarried people are so delightfully easy
to shock.
She and Einar smile, make their way towards the door.
INT. BEDROOM, NIGHT
Einar comes in, Gerda’s already in bed.

He starts to

GERDA
Turn it back on.
He looks at her. She shrugs, smiles - it’s her turn, after
all... He turns it back on, a little awkward now, undressing
in front of her. She sees this, toughs it out, watching him
anyway.
GERDA (cont’d)
Were you really corrupted by my ankles?
Einar wears just his shirt now, begins to unbutton.
EINAR
You were shameless.
GERDA
I still am.
Einar peels off his shirt. Underneath, he wears Gerda’s laceedged slip. Gerda GASPS slightly... Einar has outdone her
with this imaginative twist. But she rises to the occasion.
Feels the fabric against his body.

EINAR
Beautiful shameless Gerda...
She traces her fingers across his chest, challenged, aroused.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNING
Einar asleep, a SCRATCHING sound in the background. We see
quick charcoal strokes on paper, Gerda wrapped in Einar’s
dressing gown, at the side of the bed. She’s fascinated,
suddenly able to see the femininity of his features, plays
with it, creating a revised Einar... His eyes open...
GERDA
Did I wake you?
He raises his eyebrows, entertained.
She smiles, carries on working.

What does she think?

GERDA (cont’d)
Sorry... I couldn’t sleep.
Why?

EINAR

GERDA
Wondering about things.
EINAR
What things?
GERDA
Wondering if we made a baby last night.
Einar smiles, surprised.
EINAR
What d’you think?
Gerda shrugs, keeps sketching.
GERDA
Wondering when you got so pretty.
EINAR
Oh, I was always pretty, you just never
noticed.
Gerda LAUGHS, keeps working.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, A WEEK LATER
In the studio, Einar looks at the sketches Gerda has made of
him, darkly fascinated. He hears Gerda come in.

Hello...?
In here...

GERDA (O.S.)
EINAR

Gerda comes in, puts down her workbag, takes off her coat.
Einar’s still looking at the sketches. Gerda’s a little selfconscious...
EINAR (cont’d)
These are good.
GERDA
Do you think?
He nods, absolutely serious. Gerda absorbs this, gratified.
GERDA (cont’d)
Well thank you. Thank you.
Gerda goes out to hang up her coat, calls GERDA (cont’d)
I had coffee with Ulla. She asked
about the Artists’ Ball.
Einar draws breath to protest, but:
GERDA (cont’d)
Don’t worry - I told her no.
EINAR
You should go, you enjoy it.
GERDA
With you I enjoy it.
Einar feels guilty.
EINAR
Look - it’s good to be seen at those
things. I understand that.
GERDA
And that’s why you hate them.
Gerda shrugs - she gets it.

He smiles.

EINAR
I feel as though I’m performing myself.

Gerda looks at him a moment.

She tilts her head. A look between them... this is a

EINAR
Did you have someone in particular in mind?
A mischievous smile spreads across Gerda’s face... she starts
to laugh, Einar begins to understand... laughs along...

No - that’s outrageous!

You’d be very convincing...

You’ll have to shave closer.
Einar takes in his blanked-out face in the shaving mirror.
Gerda goes to apply eyeliner...

Close your eyes... This is hard on someone
else...
Here...

EINAR

Einar takes the crayon, draws a couple of pretty good lines.
EINAR (cont’d)
How’s that?
She marvels at his reflection.

It’s bizarrely compelling.

GERDA
Better than I ever manage.
His reflection looks back. Gerda’s energy is up...
drapes her scarf around his neck...
Oh, Lili!

She hurries him through to the studio... arranges cushions on
the chaise.
Sit!

GERDA (cont’d)

Einar sits - a distinctive pose.
EINAR
Come on, Hvap!
Hvappe jumps onto his lap. Gerda sketches quickly, absorbed,
excited. She rearranges him, ‘feminising’ his poses.
GERDA
Knee over... head up.. Look at
those hands... relax...
We see Einar at a series of angles... but his movements are
more and more parodically feminine for Gerda’s entertainment.
The more he acts it, the more fun it is, until finally Gerda
scolds, still laughing:
GERDA (cont’d)
No, don’t make her a slut!
EINAR
It’s your fault, you excite her.
Gerda gets close to pin him still.

His face closes on hers.

GERDA
Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...
EINAR
You have no idea...
He falls on her, laughing, passionate... Gerda responds, but
grabs a cloth and wipes his made-up face as he kisses her.
MONTAGE BEGINS INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM
We see Gerda’s work around the room, now, depicting ‘Lili’s’
progress. Einar, at the mirror, plucks his eyebrows to better
resemble the glamorous arch in Gerda’s sketches.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE WIDOW HOUSE
Einar and Gerda walk, a little way apart. He feels his way
into her gait, she checks back on his progress.

Gerda and Einar try on wigs, surreptitious, excited, adjust
one another’s choices. Then, a long line of almost identical
shoes, beginning in tiny sizes but gradually getting bigger.
Einar grabs the last - biggest - pair. When he looks up,
Gerda’s showing him a dress...
INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY
Einar and Gerda head out past the stage doorman, very pleased
with themselves. Gerda is several sizes fatter and taller she wears a wig with a hat on top. Hands stuffed into coat
pockets hide bulky shoes. Thorbjorn looks up briefly from
his newspaper. Then as the door closes behind Einar and
Gerda, he looks up again - ?
- MONTAGE ENDS INT. WIDOW HOUSE, EVENING
The Lili sketches depict a gamut of moods, face and posture
already becoming iconic. Einar in the slip and the new
shoes, practising his walk to settle his nerves. Hears the
front door open - quickly calls:
EINAR
I wondered where you were, it’s getting
late.
Gerda comes in...
GERDA
We have plenty of time.

I bought these...

Einar takes the stockings with interest. Gerda watches,
entertained at his enthusiasm, but a little apprehensive..

GERDA (cont’d)
Einar, are you sure about tonight?
Einar looks up, surprised. Nods, without hesitation.
Gerda’s a little taken aback at his enthusiasm.
EXT. STREET NEAR CANAL, NEAR ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, NIGHT
Dancing light and sound - up ahead, we see a glamorous,
eclectic gathering: the fun-loving, the arrogant, the
eccentric, the bourgeois - all rubbing shoulders on their
way to the Royal Academy.
Two pairs of women’s feet in step: Gerda and Einar, approach
the melee. Then Gerda realises Einar has slowed, dropped
back behind her. She turns to see him transformed in a
chiffon dress with a linen sailor’s collar and cuffs...
GERDA
What is it...?
Einar’s eyes shine animated. He cuts an ungainly figure, but
the impression is more confusing than jarring.
EINAR
Am I pretty enough?
Gerda’s surprised by the sincerity of the question.
GERDA
Of course you are...
He takes Gerda’s hand and she pulls closer.
EINAR
I’ll never be as pretty as you.
Gerda studies the features, the fire behind the eyes. An
intensity she had not been expecting... something new... A
charged moment... Gerda’s genuinely moved... but then
Einar/Lili laughs, breaks away... leaving Gerda with a beat
of emotion that doesn’t belong anywhere.
INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, STAIRCASE, NIGHT
Gerda and ‘Lili’ mingle with the crowd.

A VOICE rings out:

ULLA
My darling!
A flicker of fear in Lili... until Gerda interposes herself:
GERDA
Ulla, let me introduce...

(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

23.
CONTINUED:
Ulla’s eyes snag for a moment as they search the familiar
face and realisation dawns. Delight floods her face. Then:
ULLA
It’s Lili...!
GERDA
That’s right. Einar’s cousin from
Vejle...
ULLA
My dear, you’re exquisite...
She LAUGHS, thrilled, exchanges a look with Gerda. Lili’s
eyelashes flutter, a picture of shyness as Ulla summons the
rest of her party - revelling in their shared secret...
ULLA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
In - let’s go in...
Gerda and Lili - holding hands - join the crush:
EINAR/LILI
You won’t leave me, will you...?
Gerda looks down at Einar/Lili’s grip on her hand.
GERDA
(sincerely)
No. No, never.
She squeezes the hand and they press forward together.
INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT
A spectacular event. An orchestra plays and people dance.
Ulla’s party drink and laugh. Gerda and Lili hang back a
little, observing. There’s a circle of men in tuxedos nearby.
One glances across at Lili. Lili looks away, blushing.
EINAR/LILI
People are looking.
GERDA
Well you’re a pretty girl, you’ll
have to get used to that.
But she sees Lili’s really uncomfortable.
GERDA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
It’s fine. You’re just feeling
self-conscious.
Gerda - !

ELSA (O.S.)

They spot Elsa across the crowd... Lili shrinks.
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

24.
CONTINUED:
EINAR/LILI
Go and talk to her...
GERDA
No, I’ll stay with you...
EINAR/LILI
Go. I’ll be fine. Go before she
comes over here...
Gerda reluctantly crosses the room and greets Elsa warmly.
But by the time she glances back, Lili has gone.
Lili sits at the edge of the dancefloor on a bench carved
with mermaids, a nerve fluttering in her cheek. We see a
young man, HENRIK SANDAHL, study her closely - closely enough
to see she is not everything she appears, but this only seems
to intrigue him. He sits beside her. Lili self-consciously
takes a notebook from her bag, begins to jot things down.
Henrik leans in, his raven hair in Lili’s peripheral vision,
leans forward until Lili’s refusal to engage becomes comical.
HENRIK
Are you a reporter?
Lili looks up.

No.

EINAR/LILI
(flatly)

HENRIK
A poetess...?
Lili packs up the notebook and hurries away... Finds a
corridor, leading off the hall - quieter, darker...
Lili feels her way along the wall, relieved to be in the
cooler air, away from the party. As her eyes adjust to the
darkness, she sees a couple kissing in an alcove. A flash of
the woman’s white thigh, as the man pushes up her dress.
Lili turns away, discomfited, walks straight back into
Henrik.
HENRIK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Do you know the story of this oak
tree?
Mm...?

EINAR/LILI

Henrik indicates a tree outside, behind Lili...
HENRIK
They say if you eat its acorns you
can make a wish and become anyone
you want for a day.

CONTINUED:
Einar’s reaction flashes through Lili’s facade.
EINAR/LILI
Why would they say that...?
Henrik bows, entertained by the effect he’s had...
HENRIK
Henrik Sandahl. At your disposal.
A moment’s hesitation, then:
Lili...

EINAR/LILI

HENRIK
Are you here with someone, Lili?
EINAR/LILI
Yes - my cousin’s wife.
HENRIK
Who’s your cousin?
Lili hesitates, turns back:
EINAR/LILI
Einar Wegener. He’s a painter.
HENRIK
Rather a good one.
most people think.

Better than

EINAR/LILI
Is that right?
HENRIK
Most people our age at any rate.
Well....

EINAR/LILI

She makes to leave again, but:
HENRIK
Don’t go back in. It’s cooler
here. Besides, I’m a romantic.
EINAR/LILI
Oh really...
HENRIK
I prefer the shadows and...
Lili steals a look at him.

He lowers his voice... sincere...

CONTINUED:
HENRIK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I don’t mean to presume, but I’ve
been watching you.
A tremor of panic runs through Lili...
HENRIK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I think you might be the same.
Henrik holds out his hand. Lili looks at it, a sense of
connection she can’t understand, previously unimaginable...
Then, trembling, Lili reaches out and rests her delicate,
manicured hand in Henrik’s... and suddenly her nerves are
completely steady. Henrik leads Lili along the corridor,
away from the hall...
INT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, GREAT HALL, NIGHT
Noisier and smokier now, too much aquavit drunk, the guests a
little out of focus. Gerda scans the dishevelled crowds,
concerned - no sign of Lili. Suddenly, Ulla’s at her side.
GERDA
Have you seen Einar? I can’t find
him.
ULLA
Of course you can’t, he isn’t here!
Ulla and Gerda laugh... Ulla raises her glass... more fun!
But Gerda excuses herself, and continues looking...
EXT. ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS, LIFE-DRAWING ROOM, NIGHT
Lili and Henrik sit on a bench in the lee of a sculpted
classical nude. Lili’s cheeks burn. Henrik is clearly
fascinated. The slight sense of playacting between them only
heightens their excitement.
HENRIK
You’re different from other girls.
Lili scoffs gently.
EINAR/LILI
That’s not a very original line.
It’s true.

HENRIK
You’re old fashioned.

Lili takes Henrik in, decides to continue...
EINAR/LILI
Provincial. I’m new to the city.

(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

27.
CONTINUED:
HENRIK
No, it’s more than that. I feel
I’d need to ask permission before I
kissed you.
A bolt of something goes through Lili. Her eyes sink, drawn
and repulsed, to Henrik’s lips. She can hardly breathe...
EINAR/LILI
I probably ought to find Gerda.
She heads back toward the corridor... Henrik grabs her hand.
HENRIK
Why don’t you tell her I’ll walk
you home...?
EINAR/LILI
She wouldn’t like that...
He advances, his body pressing against her, commanding,
holding her fixed in the doorway...
Lili...

HENRIK

Lili pulls away, flustered, aroused...
EINAR/LILI
Einar might be waiting up... he
wouldn’t like this...
HENRIK
Wouldn’t he...?
No...
Lili...

EINAR/LILI
HENRIK

He steadies her... repeating her name...
HENRIK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Lili... Lili.
Three times a charm... We see something shift in Lili...
Henrik senses it... He kisses her. When he releases her she
gasps, and he kisses her again, finds his passion returned
this time... When she finally catches her breath she can’t
look at him...
EINAR/LILI
You didn’t ask permission...
HENRIK
I couldn’t risk you saying no.
(CONTINUED)
26/11/15

28.
CONTINUED:
Standing in the corridor, by the oak, Gerda watches, stunned,
as Lili clutches Henrik’s arm, looks suddenly faint, upset...
Lili looks down, confused and then panicked. Blood pours
from her nose, down the front of her dress... she’s appalled.
HENRIK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
What’s happened..? Let me...
Henrik tries to find a handkerchief... Then sees Gerda
approaching... He pulls away from Lili...
HENRIK (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I’m sorry I don’t know what...
Lili holds out her arms to Gerda. Henrik steps back... Gerda
reaches Lili, quickly takes her weight... Gerda wraps her
scarf around ‘Lili’, who now looks like Einar in grotesque
drag, smeared with make-up and blood.
GERDA
Quickly, lean on me...
Henrik watches, and onlookers stare as Gerda supports Einar
out of the ball... They stumble, clinging together, ashamed.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, NEXT MORNING
Einar paints.

In a smart male suit.

He is stiffly composed.

Gerda comes into the studio, in her nightclothes. Finds
Einar deeply immersed. No trace of the night’s upset.
GERDA
How are you...?
EINAR
You were late home last night, I
thought I’d let you sleep. How was
it? Did Lili have fun?
Gerda’s stunned.

Goes to the kitchen, upset.

In the kitchen, Lili’s bloodied clothes are soaking in a
bucket. Gerda struggles with the sight. Begins to make
coffee, then...
Gerda returns to the studio, watches Einar, anger building.
He allows it a while, then turns, braced to face her:
GERDA
I think it would be better if Lili
didn’t come here again.
Fine.

EINAR
I understand.

GERDA
You know what I would like to

Einar takes Gerda in... how furious, how shaken she looks.
GERDA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Exactly what happened between you
and Sandahl last night?
EINAR
(quickly)
Nothing.
Gerda HUFFS, disbelieving.

Einar repeats himself, angrily:

EINAR (CONT’D) (cont’d)
It was nothing.
GERDA
Did he know it was you?
Einar blushes, shies away.
EINAR
It wasn’t as simple as that.

It’s

Gerda loses control, shouts at him:
GERDA
I watched him kiss you, Einar, so
could you please make an effort?!
Einar’s shocked, ashamed.

He takes stock, then quietly:

EINAR
He may have known who I was. But I
wasn’t always... me. There was a
moment when I was... just Lili.
And I think he could see that. Do
you see?
Gerda struggles to comprehend this shift in the landscape.
GERDA
But Lili doesn’t exist.

Gerda’s mind reels, panic rises...
GERDA
This is absurd. We need to stop.
Make it stop Einar.
With genuine anxiety:
EINAR
I’m going to try...
She goes, still distressed, leaving Einar alone.
EXT. WIDOW HOUSE, EARLY MORNING, TWO WEEKS LATER
The Chinese Laundress RINGS her tiny BELLS along the street.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, MORNING
The Lili portraits are gone. Einar regards a canvas. Failing
to paint. In the kitchen, Gerda chops vegetables, throws
them in a pan. She hovers in the doorway to the studio.
GERDA
Another headache?
EINAR
It’s nothing...
She goes back into the kitchen again...
GERDA
Can I get you something?
I’m fine.

EINAR

Gerda returns to chopping.
GERDA
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Einar grows agitated.
EINAR
Gerda... I’m fine.
Gerda looks round to see Einar now in his coat. He quickly
collects a small suitcase, goes out, leaving Gerda to fret.
EXT. OPERA HOUSE, DAY
No lights on, no signs of life.

31.
INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY
Einar passes through, nods amiably to the familiar doorman.
INT. COSTUME SHOP, DAY
Einar turns on the lights, quickly pulls off his coat.
He
leans forward, bracing against the bench, looks in the
mirror. There’s a desperation about him. But now he sees:
the front of his shirt gapes - reveals a cleavage, formed by
his rounded shoulders. Einar is compelled... nervously
unbuttons his shirt to the waist and leans forward again.
The effect is startling. He traces the shape of his
‘breasts’ with trembling hands.
With a new urgency, he quickly strips off shirt, trousers,
terrified that someone might catch him, yet driven to press
on. He pulls off his underwear, returns to the mirror, pushes
his cock back between his legs, squeezing his thighs tight
until he has an approximation of a vagina. He rounds his
shoulders, takes in the arresting transformation, breathless
with excitement, terror. A sense of impending inevitable
transgression.
He opens his case. A carefully folded silk package unfurls
into a dress, brushes against his skin.
INT. STUDIO, DAY
Gerda sits in the chair looking out of the window, face set
against terror, her sketchbook closed in her lap, brooding,
pressure building. She opens the sketchbook: Lili...
INT CAFE ON CANAL, DAY
Einar/Lili arrives inside a cafe, pushes back a headscarf. We
see Henrik waiting at a table. He quickly stands when he
spots Lili - who is consumed with shyness, real fear.
HENRIK
I didn’t think you’d come.
Lili settles in her seat.
No.

EINAR/LILI
Nor did I.

INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, LATER
Gerda begins to sketch, almost afraid to begin. But her
energy gathers and there is soon anger and desire in the work
as she conjures a Lili with dark erotic potential, a frenzied
relationship with the subject developing...

26/11/15

32.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, EVENING
Gerda lies on the chaise, exhausted. Hears the door, doesn’t
move. Einar appears, in his overcoat. After a moment:
GERDA
I thought you might not come back.
EINAR
That’s absurd...
Is it?

GERDA

Einar can hardly bear the question... feels terrible, wraps
his arms around her. Then sees, at an angle, in the halflight, the new Lili picture. A nude with female hips and
breasts. A slash of red mouth. A cigarette.
INT. ART DEALER’S OFFICE, A MONTH LATER, DAY
A door opens and Gerda sits up - a THIN YOUNG MAN appears.
THIN YOUNG MAN
He won’t be much longer.
Gerda sits back, too pessimistic to feel nervous.
INT. ART DEALER’S OFFICE, HALF AN HOUR LATER
Rasmussen studies a series of Gerda’s portraits, his mouth
puckered with poorly disguised distaste. Gerda steels
herself to withstand the humiliation.
RASMUSSEN
I just... I don’t know...
And then he sees the Lili nude. He’s suddenly intrigued...
RASMUSSEN (cont’d)
The model...?
GERDA
Einar’s cousin.
RASMUSSEN
Yes, the resemblance is...
Rasmussen’s mind races.
RASMUSSEN (cont’d)
Are there others...?

Rasmussen licks his lips, excited but uncertain...
RASMUSSEN
These are different... For these, I don’t

Gerda has to confirm what she’s heard:
GERDA
You’re taking them.
RASMUSSEN
Well, yes...
He’s surprised as she is.
EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
Lili hurries past the endless orange facades of a long row of
terraced houses, Gerda’s embroidered wrap flying in the wind
behind her. Knocks at a door, breathless...
INT. HENRIK'S HOUSE, DAY
Henrik welcomes Lili at the open door...
Come in...

HENRIK

He closes the door against the world. Lili takes in the
space. She’s delighted by it LILI
I don’t have long... Gerda’s seeing
Rasmussen.
Henrik gestures for Lili to sit.

She settles on the couch.

HENRIK
I don’t like all these lies.
LILI
She’s very protective.
HENRIK
Why don’t you just tell her about
us?
LILI
I couldn’t do that...
Lili seems a little panicked...

Sorry - I don’t want to upset you.

HENRIK (cont’d)
Come here...
Lili lets herself be drawn closer to him... He strokes her
face. Lili smiles, adoring. Henrik kisses her and she
responds eagerly. His hand works its way down her body,
between her legs. Lili squirms, uncomfortable. He
persists... Lili bears it as long as she can, then gently:
LILI
No... Henrik...
Yes...
No...

HENRIK
LILI

Still in the moment of passion...
Einar...

HENRIK

Lili recoils, stunned... astonished...
What...?

LILI

HENRIK

Come on... it’s alright...
But Lili pushes him away, upset, bewildered...
LILI
I’m sorry, I don’t understand...
Henrik’s frustrated.
HENRIK
Einar... please...
Lili panics, grabs her things to leave, horribly exposed...
LILI
I don’t know what you mean... I don’t know

But Lili bolts, away and out through the front door, leaving
Henrik powerless, bereft.
EXT. HENRIK’S HOUSE, DAY
Lili rushes away, disorientated, along the row of garish
facades, their orange now seeming grotesque...
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, DAY
Gerda struggles in with her portfolio. Heads for the kitchen,
preoccupied by her experience with Rasmussen, is taken aback
to see Lili at the table, Gerda’s embroidered wrap pulled
tight about her. Then Lili looks round - her face swollen and
streaked with tears.
GERDA
(concerned)
Are you alright...?
Lili reaches out her hand and Gerda takes it...
No...

EINAR/LILI

She holds Gerda at arms length.

Takes a deep breath.

EINAR/LILI (cont’d)
I’ve been seeing Henrik Sandahl.
Gerda reels, speechless as Lili clatters out, stumbling to
the bedroom. Closes the bedroom door.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, KITCHEN, 20 MINUTES LATER
Gerda sits - waiting. Finally, Einar comes back, in male
clothing. Looks devastated.
EINAR
I thought perhaps you knew.

No.

So... are you in love with Sandahl?

Einar’s appalled:
EINAR
No - I love you, Gerda, only you. But
Lili...
Angry tears well in Gerda’s eyes.
GERDA
Why can’t you just be honest about this!
But Einar’s angry too...
EINAR
I’m trying! Gerda... please... I
need you to believe me. You of all
people to understand.
Gerda shakes her head, unable to take this in...
her, desperate imploring... Gerda struggles:

He looks at

GERDA
Okay, I need you to tell me... when Henrik
and ‘Lili’ are together, they what...? They
kiss - we know that...
Einar nods, awkward.

Gerda steels herself:

GERDA (cont’d)
Has it gone beyond that?
EINAR
No... No, Lili’s never gone further than
that with a man. She... she wouldn’t...
Gerda hears the implication... a bodyblow for her:
GERDA
There have been other men?
Einar sits on the bed, bites down on something difficult:
EINAR
There was another, but it was a long time
ago.
A chill runs through Gerda...

Einar gathers his courage.

He knocked Hans down - he was so angry...
Einar shakes his head... Gerda absorbs this. She looks up Einar looks pale, dark circles under his eyes.
GERDA
I don’t know what to say.
He breathes suddenly, against pain...
What...?

GERDA (cont’d)

His eyes close, sweat forming on his brow.
EINAR
I’m so sorry...
He doubles over, clutching his stomach... moans horribly...
EINAR (cont’d)
I’m so sorry... I’m not feeling

HEXLER (CONT’D) (cont’d)
So. Tell me about Lili. Where

Hexler seeks to inject a rational note...

Einar is strapped to a hospital trolley by a couple of

The nurses lead Gerda out... Einar takes in the alien
machinery of the room. She watches helplessly through a
tinted window as the X-ray machine begins to WHIRR. Hexler

Of course not.
Hexler is nervous, but his tone is threatening.

You should go and see them.

fickle.

Rasmussen tuts, disapproving.
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STAIRS LEADING UP, DAY
Gerda, in a hurry, stops to collect the mail from the foot of
the stairs. There’s an art magazine, a personal letter,
then, underneath an envelope from The Radium Institute...
Hexler’s name on the back. Gerda freezes, then quickly opens
it, reads: “no choice... treated for perversion...”. She
struggles for a moment, panic rising, then folds the letter,
stuffs it in her jacket. A dark decision resolves itself in
Gerda’s face...
INT. WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, DAY
Einar’s asleep.

Gerda packs, driven - sees Einar sit up.

EINAR
What are you doing?
Gerda gathers her courage.
GERDA
I’ve been asked to exhibit in Paris...
EINAR
That’s wonderful...
GERDA
Yes. We have to go. Rasmussen said it
would make all the difference...
Einar’s incredulous...
EINAR
I’m not sure I can do that...
You can.

GERDA
I’ll take care of you...

EINAR
But surely there’s no rush...
GERDA
(furious)
Can’t you just do this one thing for me?
But by the time her outburst is over, she’s shaking...
EINAR
Gerda, what’s happening?
Gerda looks at him.

He’s waiting for the truth.

GERDA
I had a letter from Hexler...
EINAR
He wants to lock me up.
Gerda holds his hands, utterly determined:
GERDA
But he won’t. Everything will work out for
us. Really - I know it. You just have to
trust me...
I do...

EINAR

Gerda steels herself:
GERDA
So. Is there anything to take care of
before we go? Anyone you need to tell?
Einar considers a moment, then:
EINAR

No.

Gerda nods, relieved. She kisses his cheek, resumes packing.
Einar concentrates on keeping breathing.
EXT. PARIS BY NIGHT
A dazzling archetypal view of the Seine and its light-studded
bridges, the Cathedral of Notre Dame a bold silhouette in the
background. VOICES come up, an EXCITED SOCIAL SOUND.
INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, NIGHT, 6 MONTHS LATER
An emphatically chic Parisian crowd admires a triumphant
series of Lili portraits - a couple that we saw at
Rasmussen’s, and then several nudes, Lili imagined as an
anatomically correct woman. A small group gathers round
Gerda, their new star, and a still pale Einar.
GERDA
Einar’s a painter too...
Oh?

MAN IN GROUP
Do you exhibit in Paris?

EINAR
I think my work is a little...
introspective for French taste.
An ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN interrupts...

ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN
Excuse me - is the model here?
Einar rides it out.

Gerda doesn’t miss a beat.

GERDA
No, she stayed behind in Denmark.
ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN
Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.
Einar looks down, away, affected... Gerda’s swept off by the
gallery owner, leaving Einar in the company of the paintings
of his own banished self.
INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT
Gerda and Einar in bed, close, tenderness on both sides.
Gerda gently kisses Einar, then begins to work her way down
his torso. He closes his eyes, wills himself to let this
happen... Gerda begins to fellate him... He struggles with
his breathing, intensely challenged
EINAR
Gerda... please... I can’t.
She continues... He’s overwhelmed with panic, pushes her off.
No...

EINAR (cont’d)

The attempt at intimacy is over, failed. Einar’s full of
guilt, distress. Gerda’s hurt, lost. Neither moves emotional paralysis.
INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO,

- NEXT DAY

Gerda works on a self-portrait. Einar appears. Gerda
hurries, to greet him, summons a playful mood, born of
desperation.
GERDA
Will you sit for me? Just as you
are. We haven’t done that since
art school. You enjoyed it then...
He smiles.

She strokes his face, encouraged.
GERDA (cont’d)
The teacher suddenly at the mercy of the
student. You found it exciting.

Gerda curls in to him.

He gently extricates himself.

EINAR

I’m sorry.

Gerda struggles to adjust to this, then:
GERDA
Well you could help me with this
background. What does it need...?
Einar looks at the painting, can hardly pull it into focus...
GERDA (cont’d)
An kettlehole lake? A farmhouse, far off?
He gently stops her Gerda...

EINAR

He’s not going to do it.

Turns away, goes out.

INT/EXT. PARIS APARTMENT
Gerda watches from the window: Einar in the street below, on
through the crowds until he’s out of sight.
EXT. RUE DE NUIT, DAY
Different part of town, different atmosphere. Prostitutes on
the corner CLUCK indulgent as Einar passes. He looks selfconsciously about, enters a dingy house as another man comes
out. They barely acknowledge one another.
INT. 22 RUE DE NUIT, 1ST FLOOR LANDING, DAY
A hatch in a door slides open, and MADAME CARTON’s eyes flash
greedily from behind an iron grille.
INT. 22 RUE DE NUIT, ROOM NO. 3, DAY
The tiny room contains a chair and a bin. We hear GROANS from
an adjoining room. There are two small windows with black
shades drawn. Einar settles, slowly lifts one of the shades.
Behind smudged glass, a worn-out girl in a corset and
stockings grinds against a chair, sullen. Beyond her, we see

against it.
Einar studies the girl and gradually his body begins to
mirror hers, a parody of female abandon. We see his
reflection in the glass now, gradually eclipsing her... He
breathes, an almost orgasmic GASPING breath of relief.
INT. HANS OFFICE, QUAI D’ORSAY, PARIS, A WEEK LATER, DAY
HANS AXGIL on the telephone. An impressively upholstered man,
quixotic, appealing. The emphatically masculine room - dark
wood infused with Hans’ cigar smoke - overlooks a
breathtaking view of the Seine. A sense of space, freedom.

Hans laughs, shakes his head. A quiet KNOCK and a secretary
pulls a face around the door. Hans waves her away, impatient.
HANS (cont’d)
Look, I have to go. I have some Danish girl
waiting to see me. But tell him we’ll find
another buyer, no problem. He’s always the
same!
INT. HANS AXGIL’S OFFICE, RECEPTION, DAY
Gerda’s immediately on her feet, her strong right hand
stretched towards Hans, unavoidable. She’s no girl.
HANS
Hans Axgil..
He shakes her hand, intrigued.

Gerda’s a little over-eager.

GERDA
Thank you so much for...
HANS
Don’t thank me yet - I can’t represent you.
I don’t handle any contemp...

His secretary suppresses a smile.

HANS
Let you speak?
Hans takes her in, the tough fragility of her.

Smiles.

HANS (cont’d)
I’m a much better listener when I’m eating.
He nods goodbye to his secretary, shows Gerda the door.
EXT. STREET NEAR HANS’ OFFICE
They hurry along the street, approach the restaurant...
HANS
Well, I don’t know why Rasmussen
gave you my number, but I’m happy
he did...
GERDA
I asked him, I wanted to meet you,
put a face to a name...
Hans smiles, encouraged. He holds open the door to a smart
brasserie. Gerda goes through ahead of him. As she does:
GERDA (cont’d)
I believe you were a childhood
friend of my husband.
Hans is left holding the door, alone.
HANS
(crestfallen)
You have a husband?
INT. SMART BRASSERIE, DAY
Gerda and Hans settle at a table.

He nods to the sommelier.

HANS
A bottle of the Mersault...
The sommelier hurries away.

Hans studies Gerda.

Who is she?

GERDA
I’m married to Einar Wegener.
Hans is amazed.
To Einar?

HANS
Of course I remember him. My God - we were
such friends. How is he?
Hans is excited, a boy again. Gerda can’t help it, blurts:
GERDA
He told me that you kissed him once.
Hans is taken aback...
HANS
I what...??
But his amazement shifts as it comes back to him...
HANS (cont’d)
Oh no! You’re right... We were fooling
in the kitchen. Einar was wearing his
grandmother’s apron...
Hans laughs, amazed at his younger self:
HANS (cont’d)
We were just little boys, you know,
playing around? Anyway, Einar just
looked so pretty in that apron - I
kissed him! Next thing I know, his
father’s chasing me out.
Hans shakes his head...
HANS (cont’d)
God - Einar. Hey - why didn’t he come
today?
GERDA
He doesn’t know I’m here. I don’t think
he’d like me asking for help.
Hans’ eyes flash, focused. This is what she’s come for, then:
GERDA (cont’d)
We don’t really know people here. And
Einar’s... he’s lost his way. He’s not
working. He needs someone to represent
him - someone who knows, him. He needs a
friend.
Hans scrutinises Gerda, her pride at odds with her need. And
for the first time in her life, Gerda looks away, unable to
hold someone’s gaze.

I don’t want a new dealer. It doesn’t make

She goes to contradict, but he cuts her off:
No dealer.

Thank you.

It’s Hans Axgil.
Einar stops, astonished.
GERDA (cont’d)
Dinner at La Dauphine at eight, then back
here to see the paintings.
Gerda’s out of the door, leaving Einar alone with the news.
INT. LA DAUPHINE RESTAURANT, NIGHT
An intimate place by the Pont Neuf. An empty chair at the
table. Gerda and Hans wait. Hans smokes.
GERDA
You know, Einar’s still stricken

Really. He’s expecting you... and it will

But they’re both a little apprehensive as they enter.
Einar...?

Gerda reorientates herself in the proceedings, turns to Hans
who stands struggling to make sense of the scene before him:
GERDA (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Hans, may I introduce Lili Wegener Einar’s cousin from home.
Now Lili’s up, her hand held out.

Hans takes it...

LILI
You can’t imagine how happy I am.
He holds on to her hand, instinctively kind...
LILI (cont’d)
We met before in Vejle, but you probably
don’t remember...
Hans is utterly wrongfooted...
GERDA
Can I take your coat Hans?
HANS
Of course...
He comes to, allows Gerda to relieve him of it. She takes it
away. Lili continues, frighteningly animated...
LILI
A digestif, Hans? It’s so chilly all of a
sudden. I feel the cold these days. I
don’t know why...
Thank you.

HANS

Hans sits, but his eyes wander to the portraits that are now
ranged around the room. A kaleidoscope of Lili.
LILI
I’m so sorry Einar couldn’t be here. He
told me: in Vejle you were his great
friend. Both always plotting to getting
away!

in peace, who told him it was alright to be
a painter.
Gerda returns to the room. Hans searches Lili’s face for the
remains of his old friend Einar.
HANS
He... used to sketch my portrait. Take a
stone and draw me on the rocks at the side
of the road.
GERDA
I didn’t know that.
Oh yes.

Gerda turns to Hans:
GERDA
Would you like to see more of Einar’s

It creates someone else, more than just the
two of you. It would be terrible never to

Her expression crumbles... Hans looks to Gerda...
Lili...

GERDA

Lili’s dissolving...
Excuse me.

LILI

She hurries out towards the bedroom, clearly in distress.
Hans struggles to comprehend the situation...
GERDA
You... you ought to go...
HANS
No - let me help...
She turns, holds Hans’ hands... the intimacy, intensity of
connection surprises him:
GERDA
Please - please - I’m sorry...
He resigns himself to leaving... as he reaches the door:
HANS
Goodnight Lili...
LILI (O.S.)

Gerda in bed. Lili’s sleeping head on the pillow next to
her, where Einar’s once was. Gerda turns out the light.

Gerda arrives to find Lili in a bright dress with matching
scarf. Shopping bags everywhere. Slight tension in the air.

Yes.

Lili and Gerda take each other in, on a new footing...
INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO, DAY - MONTAGE
Gerda paints Lili who has found a new stillness. A more
serious spirit beneath the translucent skin. A sense of her
growing into herself.
We see on the wall now a number of double portraits, telling
the story of a developing negotiation - Gerda and Lili
depicted together, with a sense of close friendship or a
wistful attempt at coupledom.
Now Gerda paints with Lili advising... The two
collaborating, a sense of shared vision.
And throughout, we see Lili fully imagined as a woman, and an
increasingly idealised one - unrealistically lovely...
INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, RAINY NIGHT, ONE MONTH LATER
Another show of ‘Lili’ paintings. A lot of the paintings of
the two as a couple, but Gerda is here alone. She feels it.
She works the room, determined, then sees Hans, across the
crowd. Misses a beat. They make their way toward one
another. An awkward social kiss. Gerda’s unusually brittle.

Einar at a desk piled high with books. He reads, driven,
fascinated. We see the books: The Normal and Abnormal Man, A
Scientific Study of Sexual Immorality...

Einar makes his way through the park. He looks bizarre in
daylight, like a woman dressed as a man. He passes a couple
of rough-looking younger men. One HISSES under his breath:
Lesbian...

YOUNGER MAN

Einar looks round, amazed, almost amused at the mistake...
when the men recognise that Einar is - in fact - a man, they
LAUGH, shocked. Einar keeps walking, conscious of the men
shadowing him, making silly obscene noises and comments.

The first Young Man leers and LAUGHS and then we suddenly see
his nose burst with blood as Einar’s fist connects. The two

energy, but they regroup and then Einar’s down, fists and
feet flying, the men beating him furiously, until they
finally run away.

That’s alright.

Einar struggles a moment, then:
EINAR
Every morning I promise myself I’ll spend
the whole day as Einar. But there’s so
little Einar left.
HANS
You need building up...
EINAR
No. I think Lili’s thoughts. All the time.
Even here, now, I’m having to work so hard
just to... to be me. To be this.
He gestures, hopeless.

But Hans won’t be defeated.

HANS
You think these things because you’re
exhausted...
Einar confesses.
EINAR
I think sometimes about killing Einar.
It’s only the thought that I’d be killing
Lili too that stops me.
Hans is appalled, struggles for words.

LILI (CONT’D)
I’m going on Friday. Will you come
with me?
Gerda’s mind races to absorb the announcement...
GERDA
I won’t help you to hurt yourself.
Lili bites down on it:
LILI
Gerda, will you come...?
INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, LILI’S ROOM, RAINY NIGHT

Lili’s sitting up in bed, Gerda’s bright scarf around her
shoulders.
Warnekros holds Lili’s wrist, checks the pulse.

This will be harder than the last
operation? You understand that.
Yes I do.

It’s complex surgery.

Then, more thoughtful:

And maybe a child. Like a real

Warnekros nods, kindly, but...

Get some rest, now. Goodnight.

Lili smiles, seeing Gerda. Gerda sits on the bed.
LILI
You’re still angry with me.
GERDA
I’m not angry with you, I’m worried
about you.
Gerda lays her head in Lili’s lap, tired with anxiety. Lili
strokes her hair. We feel the depth of love between them.
LILI (CONT’D)
You heard my wish Gerda. When no
one else could hear me, you did.
Gerda’s eyes begin to fill.

She collects herself.

GERDA
Come. We both need our rest. I
can sleep in the chair, there...
LILI
Off to your little hotel.

I don’t mind...

Are there chocolates on the pillow?

Cigarette burns.
Lili laughs, kisses Gerda’s cheek.

Lili goes to hand over Gerda’s scarf, but:
GERDA
You keep it. For now.
Lili smiles, a little mischievous.

But then a look between

I’m going to be fine.
Gerda nods, determined to believe it.
Yes.

GERDA

LILI
Sleep well.
Goodnight.

GERDA

Lili is determinedly bright. Gerda takes her coat and bag.
The door closes behind her. A couple of moments pass and
then Lili begins to dissolve, releasing tears of overwhelming
fear and anticipation...
INT. DRESDEN HOTEL, RECEPTION, NIGHT
The CONCIERGE approaches, solicitous.
Room 9.

GERDA

The concierge turns to get Gerda’s key. The sound of a
cocktail piano in an adjacent room serves to reinforce her
isolation. But then she sees reflected in the mirror - a
familiar face Hans...?

Gerda turns, barely holding herself together... he catches
her in a heavy, passionate embrace. A huge sense of relief,
reunion, trust.
HANS
It’s alright.
Gerda nods, greatly comforted by his presence.
Yes.

GERDA

HANS
Everything will be alright.
Gerda hangs on to Hans, desperately wanting it to be true.
INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, LILI’S ROOM, DAWN
A nurse helps a quietly determined Lili into a surgical gown.
INT. OPERATING THEATRE
Warnerkros, scrubbed in, serious, ready to begin.
WARNEKROS
Good luck, everybody.
Lili anaesthetised. We stay on her face, hear voices, the
clank of instruments. Rain beginning... the sound of it
increasingly intense as the wind comes up too...
INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, RECEPTION, NEXT MORNING
Morning light streams in, harsh, unforgiving. Hans holds the
door for Gerda. She’s barely inside when the Receptionist
jumps urgently to her feet.
RECEPTIONIST
Professor Warnekros would like a
word...

Gerda’s faces register anxiety. Hans gestures - he’s backing
off. He’ll wait. Gerda hurries away.

They arrive at the doorway to Lili’s room. Warnekros shows

Warnekros’s clearly worried. Gerda’s astonished at how ill
she looks.

He can’t finish, but Gerda barely hears him anyway...

Go away... thank you.

Gerda hangs in the doorway, blocking it, until Warnekros is
obliged to turn away. We follow him, walking back down the
corridor, alone, excluded, burdened by failure.
INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, GARDEN, NIGHT
Heavy spots of rain begin to splash down. Most of the
hospital in darkness. A light glowing in one room.
INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, LILI’S ROOM, NIGHT
Gerda in the chair at Lili’s bedside, mopping her brow. The
rainstorm beating outside. A nurse enters with a jug of
water. Gerda nods, grateful.

INT. WARNEKROS’S CLINIC, DRESDEN, LILI’S ROOM
Lili sleeping, calmer now. Her face translucent in the
morning light. Gerda sleeps in the chair beside her. Gerda
wakes, disoriented for a moment, then looks at Lili, sleeping
peacefully, clearly cooler now... Gerda feels her brow - no
heat there any more...
Gerda’s relief is palpable. She
smooths Lili’s fringe, then gets up, opens the curtains wide - the sun just starting to show in the rain-washed sky.
She turns back to see Lili’s eyes open.
Lili...?

Lili struggles to speak.

How are you?

Her voice is faint, cracked.

She takes in Hans and Gerda:

LILI
I am... entirely myself.
Hans laughs gently.
HANS
I’ll tell Warnekros she’s awake.
Hans goes.

Gerda sits back beside Lili, fixes her hair.

EXT. CLINIC GARDENS
Gerda wheels Lili out in a wheelchair, Hans holding the door
open for her to pass. A glance between him and Gerda, then
he leaves the women alone.
Gerda is settles herself in a chair beside Lili, rests her
hand on Lili’s arm. The birch trees in Spring leaf. A light
breeze makes them quiver. Lili’s breathing is shallow. We
feel the depth of love between the women, and the
precariousness of their situation.

Lili’s features arrange themselves into an expression of
perfect joy as she sinks back into something which Gerda
gradually sees is deeper than sleep...

Gerda presses Lili’s hand against her cheek, overwhelmed with
grief. Lili looks blissfully happy. The dawn light grows
stronger in the garden...
INT/EXT. JUTLAND, DAWN, TWO WEEKS LATER
Hans’ car rolls into the bleak landscape. Hans and Gerda
inside. Gerda looks out - at a landscape she knows with
absolute intimacy, although she’s never been here before.
It’s all here... the imagery from Einar’s paintings, singing
with life... A wild stretch of rocky green under soft
northern light, a row of beautiful black-limbed trees, bent
over, but not broken, by the wind...

EXT. CLIFFS OVERLOOKING KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, MORNING
Hans tails Gerda. She battles the incredible gusts of salt
air, the bright scarf flying like a flag at her throat. She
pushes on, closer to the cliff edge... Finally she reaches
an amazing vantage point, is stunned by the view: a rectangle
of ferociously stormy sea, silver waves whipped by a wind
that stings, relentless. We hear the RUSTLE and PUNCH of the
weather going at her. Hans joins her. They stand there
looking out until they can hardly breathe any more.
Hans takes her armto steady her, but as she turns toward him
the wind rips up under the bright scarf, snatches it into the
air. Gerda GASPS - a moment of loss - but then, something
else... As Hans hurries to try and catch it GERDA
No - leave it..!

Leave it..

She pulls him back, watches it dance, tears of joy in her
eyes...
GERDA (CONT’D)
Let it fly...
The scarf swoops up and dives down, curls and rolls, as free
as child... a girl at play. Gerda clutches her coat at her
breast, almost delirious at the beauty of it. Hans watches
with her - the absurdly joyous spectacle of it, a stunning
farewell. And as the scarf dances out from the cliff, out to
sea... into eternity...
