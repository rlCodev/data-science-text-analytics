Written by
Noah Oppenheim

FADE IN:
EXT. HYANNIS BEACH - DAY
JACKIE KENNEDY. Jet-black bouffant, regal bearing, perfect
symmetrical features.
But the light behind her eyes has gone out.
She walks alone, shuddering against a frigid wind.
FADE TO BLACK.
SUPER: Hyannis Port, Massachusetts 1963
FADE IN:
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
Jackie -- black trim slacks, beige pullover sweater -- paces
at the window.
Finally, a cab pulls into the driveway.
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - FOYER
A JOURNALIST -- handsome yet rumpled -- stands uneasily in
the doorway.
JOURNALIST
Mrs. Kennedy? They told me to come
up.
She studies his unkempt appearance, but doesn't answer. The
Journalist is perplexed but strains to be gentle...
JOURNALIST (CONT'D)
I- I'm so sorry for your loss.
Jackie takes a long moment -- her voice raw...
JACKIE
Have you read what they've been
writing? Krock and Merriman and
all the rest?
JOURNALIST
Yes. I have.

2.
JACKIE
Merriman is such a bitter man.
It's been just one week and already
they’re treating him like some
dusty old artifact, to be shelved
away.
(beat)
That’s no way to be remembered.
JOURNALIST
And how would you like him
remembered, Mrs. Kennedy?
Suddenly stern, authoritative -JACKIE
You understand that I will be
editing this conversation?
(beat)
Just in case I don’t say exactly
what I mean.
JOURNALIST
With all due respect that seems
very unlikely, Mrs. Kennedy.
Jackie stares at him, polite but firm.
JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
Right. Okay. So this will be your
own version of...what happened.
Holding his gaze, she refocuses, preparing for a performance
of sorts.
Exactly.

JACKIE
Come in.

EXT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - DECK
Jackie and the Journalist sit across from each other at a
table. She smokes a cigarette, lost in the horrible memory.
JACKIE
I thought it was another backfire.
(beat)
I very nearly didn’t go. What if
I’d been here, or out riding in
Virginia somewhere?
(beat)
Thank God I was with him...
She trails off.

3.
JOURNALIST
Why, thank God?
Instead of an answer-JACKIE
Do you know what I think of
history?
JOURNALIST
Of history?
JACKIE
I've read a great deal. More than
people realize. The more I read,
the more I wonder: When something
is written down, does that make it
true?
JOURNALIST
It's all that we have.
JACKIE
Had. We have television now. Now
people can see with their own eyes.
JOURNALIST
That tour of the White House you
did a couple of years ago, for CBS,
I always assumed you did that
for...a purpose? No? After the
fashion magazines? You even won an
Emmy...
JACKIE
I didn’t do that program for me. I
did it for the American people.
JOURNALIST
That program was my first glimpse
into the White House and for
whatever it’s worth, I thought you
were excellent, very poised.
Thank you.

JACKIE

An afterthought...
JOURNALIST
You could have had a career as a
broadcaster. I’m sure.

4.

What?

JACKIE

The Journalist looks up from his notes.
I’m sorry?

JOURNALIST

JACKIE
What did you say?
JOURNALIST
(nervous)
I said...you could have had a
career as a broadcaster.
JACKIE
Are you giving me professional
advice?
He shakes his head, embarrassed...
JOURNALIST
I’m not.
(beat)
But I’m sure that the whole country
would like to know what you’re
going to do next.
JACKIE
I can assure you -- not television.
She takes another drag of her cigarette.
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE (1962)
Jackie is a year younger -- at the height of her legendary
beauty -- wearing a floor-length, scarlet gown.
JACKIE
Welcome to the White House.
Behind her are LIGHTS and BOOM MIC’s -- a full-blown
TELEVISION PRODUCTION.
She stands face to face with NANCY TUCKERMAN, her social
secretary. Life-long friends, Nancy is Jackie's less
stylish, less successful sister.
Displeased with the sound of her voice, Jackie lifts her
shoulders, her posture more erect. She tries again.

5.
JACKIE (CONT’D)
Welcome to the White House.
so proud to call it home.

We’re

Her brow furrows, still dissatisfied.
NANCY
Why don’t you try ‘the people’s
house’? Make it more personal.
Jackie considers the suggestion. And now -- with that
notorious, breathy diction...
JACKIE
Welcome to the people's house.
We're so proud to call it home.
(beat)
Better?
Nancy nods.
JACKIE (CONT’D)
When will Jack join us?
NANCY
They want to hear from you.
Jackie is skeptical -JACKIE
They think I’m a fool -- one year
in office, wasting their money.
NANCY
That’s why you need to show them
what you’ve done.
Nancy can tell Jackie is still uneasy.
NANCY (CONT’D)
The President will join you in the
Monroe Room. At the end of the
tour. You'll be great.
Jackie smiles, grateful and takes a deep breath.
JACKIE
Stay close.
NANCY
Of course. You look beautiful.
Jackie walks onto set and the TV LIGHTS turn ON.

6.
INT. STAGING ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1962)- CONTINUOUS
**This is the legendary White House tour, broadcast by CBS on
February 14, 1962, to an audience of 56 million people**
CHARLES COLLINGSWOOD of CBS NEWS narrates over black and
white footage.
COLLINGSWOOD (V.O.)
This is the White House as seen
from its South Lawn. For the next
hour Mrs. John F. Kennedy invites
you to visit the President’s House
and see some of the restorations
she’s made in its interior. Mrs.
John F. Kennedy, third youngest of
the twenty-nine wives to live in
the White House.
Jackie's beauty has been magnified ten-fold. Her nerves have
vanished. She smiles, radiant, and the show is on...
COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs. Kennedy I want to thank you
for letting us visit your official
home.
(beat)
This is obviously the room from
which most of your work on it is
directed...
All around them, ANTIQUE FURNITURE is arranged in various
states of restoration and disrepair.
JACKIE
(playful)
Yes, it's attic and the cellar all
in one. Since our work started we
received hundreds of letters every
day. This is where we evaluate all
of the finds and see if we want to
keep them if they’ll fit into our
budget.
COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs. Kennedy, every first lady and
every administration since
President Madison's time, has made
changes greater or smaller in the
White House.
Jackie steals a glance off-camera.
Nancy reminds her to smile.

With a quiet gesture --

COLLINGSWOOD (CONT’D)
Before we look at some of the
changes you've made...What's your
basic plan?
A beat, as Jackie considers her motivation.
the heart --

And then, from

JACKIE
Well, I really don't have one.
Because I think this house will
always grow and should. It just
seemed to me such a shame when we
came here, to find hardly anything
of the past in the house. Hardly
anything before 19-2.
Off-camera Nancy looks at her notes, nodding along to
Jackie’s words.
COLLINGSWOOD
Now suppose you and your committee
were to acquire some of the things
that are in this room, what happens
when the next President’s wife
comes into the White House?
JACKIE
Well if they don’t want it...in the
past, you see, they could sell it
or throw it out.
CUT TO:
EXT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - DECK- DAY
Jackie continues the interview with the Journalist.
JOURNALIST
And the talk of the tax payer money
being wasted?
JACKIE
I raised every dime privately that
we spent on that restoration. I
loved that house and wanted to
share it with the American people.
To impart a sense of America’s
greatness.
(beat)
(MORE)

8.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
Objects and artifacts last far
longer than people and they
represent important ideas in
history, identity...beauty.
He scribbles down her remarks -- all cold, abstract ideas.
And then, probing, trying to find the emotion...
JOURNALIST
I’m sure the readers would like to
know... What it’s like to be a
member of your family?
Jackie thinks -- and then...
JACKIE
Imagine a little boy surrounded by
all this. Having his older brother
die in battle and then going off to
that same war and coming home a
hero. People see that little boy,
born to wealth, privilege, willing
to sacrifice everything for his
ideals and service to his nation.
JOURNALIST
Royalty. You make it sound like
royalty.
JACKIE
Well for royalty you need
tradition. And for tradition you
need time.
JOURNALIST
Well I guess it has to start
somewhere, right? There has to be a
day one?
CUT TO:
INT. EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1962)
Jackie and Collingswood now stand in the sprawling East Room.
COLLINGSWOOD
This is the East Room, pretty much
as Americans have known it now for
sixty years. Obviously you haven’t
felt like you had to make any great
changes in it.

9.
JACKIE
No, I think it's lovely. I hate to
make changes really, so when you
find a room like this, it's
wonderful.
COLLINGSWOOD
This piano brings to mind that this
is the part of the White House
where you have the musical affairs?
JACKIE
That’s right this piano was
designed by Franklin Roosevelt with
the Eagle’s Support.
(beat)
And this is the end of the room
where Pablo Casals played for us,
where we had a portable stage built
for us, when we had the Shakespeare
Players.
COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs. Kennedy, this administration
has shown a particular affinity for
artists, musicians, writers, and
poets.
Behind the camera, Nancy tracks Jackie’s every move.
COLLINGSWOOD (CONT’D)
Is this because you and your
husband just feel that way. Or do
you think there's a relationship
between the government and the
arts?
Jackie pauses -- clearly hesitant to tread on any ground
resembling public policy.
JACKIE
That's so complicated. I—I don't
know.
(beat)
I just think that everything in the
White House should be the best.
INTERCUT -INT. EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1961)
The East Room at its most glamorous.

10.
Jackie is seated in the first row of an audience listening to
Pablo Casals play Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Trio No. 1 in D
minor, Op. 49.
Jackie is transfixed. Happy.
INT. EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1962)
Nancy watches Jackie speak to Collingswood.
JACKIE
And if it's an American company
that you can help, I like to do
that. If it’s not...Just as long
as it's the best.
INT. EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1961)
PUSH IN on Jackie, basking in Casal’s performance.
Captivated.
The final note.

The music ends.
CUT TO:

INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
The interview continues inside. She sits on the couch now,
across from the Journalist.
JOURNALIST
Is your faith helping you?
JACKIE
I’d prefer to discuss my faith with
a priest. You’re not a man of the
cloth, are you?
JOURNALIST
No, I’m not. I’m just trying to get
to the truth. That’s what
reporters do.
JACKIE
The truth? Well I’ve grown
accustomed to a great divide
between what people believe and
what I know to be real.

11.
JOURNALIST
Fine, I will settle for a story
that’s believable.
JACKIE
That’s more like it. You know I
used to be a reporter myself once.
I know what you’re looking for.
JOURNALIST
(confused)
I’m sorry?
JACKIE
A moment-by-moment account. That’s
what you came her for, isn’t it?
(beat)
You want me to describe the sound
the bullet made when it collided
with my husband’s skull.
CUT TO:
INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESIDENTIAL QUARTERS - DALLAS, 1963
Jackie applies makeup in the mirror while practicing a speech
in Spanish. Her delivery is practiced, careful.
JACKIE
I’m very happy to be in the great
state of Texas, to be with you and
experience the noble Spanish
tradition that has achieved so much
in Dallas. This tradition started
100 years ago before the
colonization of Massachusetts, my
husband’s State. It is a tradition
that remains alive and strong.
She puts on her famous pink, pillbox hat and closes the
mirror.
INT./EXT. DALLAS - LOVE FIELD - DAY
Jackie walks through the plane. She can hear the loud crowd
outside.
JACKIE
(hopeful)
Is that the sound of birds?
Playing along with his wife --

12.
PRESIDENT KENNEDY (O.S.)
Not exactly birds. Must be the
ocean...
(beat)
Are you ready?
JACKIE
(ironic)
Of course. I love crowds.
The door opens. Jackie walks off AIR FORCE ONE onto the
tarmac at LOVE FIELD.
It is NOVEMBER 22, 1963.
She is wearing that pink wool Chanel suit with navy lapels,
an outfit that will soon be notorious but right now, in the
morning light, is cheery and elegant, another fashion
pronouncement by the most stylish woman in America.
Beside her is her husband, PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.
Jackie absorbs the roar of the crowd like a physical assault.
Then sees GOVERNOR JOHN CONNALLY and his wife NELLIE waiting
at the bottom of the short staircase, flanked by a saluting
honor guard.
The crowds are chanting "JACK-EE! JACK-EE!"
LYNDON JOHNSON
You remember the Governor and Mrs.
Connally?
LADYBIRD
Welcome to Dallas, Darling.
She carefully descends to the bottom of the stairs, where
suddenly -- Nellie thrusts a bouquet of RED ROSES into her
hands.
A beat, as she eyes the crimson blossoms.
And then -- shouting over the screaming crowd...
JACKIE
My! What a welcome!
The Governor places a conspiratorial arm around the President
and holds him for a whispered conference.
Amidst the chaos, Jackie turns around to face the CROWD,
which erupts in even louder cheers. She blushes, almost
embarrassed, and responds with a demure smile.

13.
Then she notices -- the President is on the move again. She
hurries to catch up as he marches toward the waiting limo.
Jackie holds a grin in place and methodically makes eye
contact with every voter on the rope line -Thank you.

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Thank you so much for
CUT TO:

INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
The interview with Journalist continues. Her voice quivering,
a stream of consciousness...
JACKIE
There’d been the biggest motorcade
from the airport. Hot, wild like
in Mexico or Vienna. The sun was
strong in our faces but I couldn’t
wear my sunglasses. Jack has his
hand out and I see a piece of his
skull come off. It wasn’t flesh
colored, it wasn’t white. He slumps
in my lap. His blood, his brains in
my lap. And I’m saying Jack, Jack
can you hear me, Jack, I love you
Jack!
(through tears)
And his head was so beautiful, and
his mouth was beautiful and his
eyes were open. I was trying to
keep the top of his head down. Keep
it all in. He had the most
wonderful expression on his face,
you know? Just before they’d ask
him a question, just before he’d
answer. He looked puzzled.
(beat)
I knew he was dead.
She lights a cigarette. The Journalist looks up from his
notes.
JOURNALIST
(clears throat)
Mrs. Kennedy-JACKIE
Don’t think for one second I’m
going to let you publish that.

Yes, of course. I understand.
The Journalist looks down.

are blank, exhausted.

Her wide-set, deep brown eyes

Her mascara is streaked, her cheeks scarred with red-brown
smudges. The dried blood of her dead husband. She stares at
herself in the mirror. The pillbox hat is gone -- cast on
the floor -- and her usually perfect hair is tousled.
Frantically, she scrubs at the blood, some of it still wet,
with Kleenex.
She wipes at her reflection in the mirror.
Finally, she pats her face dry with a hanging towel. Then,
noticing her hair, she attempts to restore its shape with her
hands. Her hands quiver.
Frustrated, she lets out a wrenching SOB.
KNOCK!

And then -- KNOCK!

O'BRIEN (O.S.)
Mrs. Kennedy? Are you alright?
It's Larry...
She takes in a breath, forcing her composure.

15.
JACKIE
I'll be ready in a moment.
LARRY O'BRIEN, the President's Congressional Liaison and old
family friend, speaks to her from the doorway.
O’BRIEN
Take all of the time you need.
With her fingers she wipes the tears and blood from under her
eyes.
JACKIE
Are they waiting?
Jackie stares at herself in the mirror -- a macabre
distortion of the picture from Love Field that morning.

Johnson kisses his wife, then places his hand on Jackie’s
shoulder.
A FLASHBULB erupts, capturing the moment.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON (CONT’D)
Let’s start the engines and get
some of the heat off this plane.
Thank you.
Valenti shakes President Johnson’s hand and addresses him.
VALENTI

Jackie sits, staring straight

Suddenly she rises and approaches CLINT HILL, the head of her
Secret Service detail.
JACKIE
Agent Hill? Can you tell me...what
size was the bullet?
A beat of silence, everyone unsettled.
JACKIE (CONT’D)
I don’t think it was a thirty
eight, was it? What do you call it?
The caliber? It seemed bigger. It
seemed like something soldiers
would use or maybe it was the kind
they use for deer hunting....
O’BRIEN
(very careful)
Mrs. Kennedy, you don’t have to-we don’t know yet.
No one answers.

She becomes distant, lost in concentration.

She turns to her husband’s oldest friends, the IRISH MAFIA -KENNY O’DONNELL, O’Brien, and DAVE POWERS.
JACKIE
We need to have the Irish Cadets.
I'm sorry?

O'BRIEN

JACKIE
Yes. The Irish Cadets -- for the
funeral. Jack loved them. He saw
them perform in Dublin last summer.
O'BRIEN
Of course, Mrs. Kennedy.

We'll

JACKIE
And those bagpipers from Scotland.
What were they called, Kenny?

18.

Yeah.

O'DONNELL
The Black Watch.

JACKIE
That's right. The Black Watch
Pipers.
Hill approaches -HILL
When we arrive, we'll be exiting
out the rear of the plane. You,
the President -- President Johnson
that is, Mrs. Johnson-JACKIE
--Why the rear?
HILL
There's press at Andrews. Not to
mention the security risk-JACKIE
--I'm supposed to hide away.
Not hide--

Now?

HILL

Jackie's voice rises, an unexpected anger-JACKIE
--I'm sure those people would love
that. What do they call
themselves? The Birch Society? No,
I will not sneak out the back door.
(beat, final)
I'll go out the usual way. We all
will.
Hill is about to argue, but Jackie stares back at him -defiant -- and he realizes it's a lost cause.
HILL
I'll arrange it.
And now ADMIRAL GEORGE BURKLEY interjects-BURKLEY
When we land, Mrs. Kennedy, we'll
need to proceed directly to the
hospital for the autopsy.

19.
JACKIE
(aghast)
The autopsy?
(beat)
Is that necessary?
BURKLEY
I'm afraid it's required.
By who?

JACKIE

BURKLEY
The law, Mrs. Kennedy.
She considers this.

And then --

JACKIE
And what exactly will they do?
Burkley hesitates -- looks to the others for help -- but no
one knows what she means.
BURKLEY
I’m not sure-JACKIE
--What does an ‘autopsy’ entail? I
want you to explain to me. I want
all of the details. I’m his wife -or whatever I am now.
(beat)
I want all the details. Will they
slice him open?
LADY BIRD JOHNSON approaches. Nearly 20 years Jackie's
senior, she is a warm, maternal presence.
Lady Bird moves toward Jackie as if she might give her a hug - but stops short, repulsed by the gore that still clings to
Jackie's dress.
LADY BIRD
Oh, Darling.
She takes Jackie's hand, instead.
LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
Can I send someone back to help you
change? Before we land?
Jackie glances down at her dress and seems to take in the
horror again, for the first time.

20.
LADY BIRD (CONT'D)
All those cameras... People will be
watching.
But Jackie is lost in her own world...
JACKIE
There were wanted posters.
Everywhere. For Jack. With Jack's
face on them.....
JACKIE (CONT’D)
Let them see what they've done.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE - REAR PASSENGER CABIN - ANDREWS AFB
Jackie remains seated as the plane comes to a halt.
She watches as a FORKLIFT passes by, headed to the rear of
the plane where it will unload her husband's casket.
Suddenly, from the front of the plane, she hears -BOBBY (O.S.)
Jackie?! Where's Jackie?
She rises -- as ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY, his face
streaked with tears -- comes rushing down the aisle.
Bobby!

JACKIE

She collapses into his arms and buries herself into his
shoulder. Amidst the noisy chaos of the now-crowded cabin,
they are quiet.
And then -- the rear door swings open, letting in a gust of
cold November air.
The FORKLIFT is positioned directly outside, and several CREW
MEN now step onto the plane and take hold of the CASKET.
An AIR FORCE OFFICER, in charge of the Crew, informs Bobby...
AF OFFICER
Sir, there's a car waiting on the
tarmac to take you and Mrs. Kennedy
to Bethesda.
Jackie is suddenly panicked --

BOBBY
(to AF Officer)
Mrs. Kennedy and I will ride with
the casket. In the ambulance.
O'Brien pulls Bobby aside, but still in earshot of Jackie.
O'BRIEN
Valenti wants to know how we are
going to handle the exit.
The exit?

Hey! Slow down.
They sit in silence, staring straight ahead.
INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - PRIVATE WAITING ROOM
Jackie looks in anguish at the door that leads to the
operating room.
She is surrounded by family and friends but nobody dares to
speak. Next to her is Nancy. Also BENJAMIN and TONI BRADLEE,
close friends. JANET LEE and HUGH AUCHINCLOSS, JACKIE'S
mother and step-father. PAM TURNURE, JACKIE'S press
secretary and MARY GALLAGHER, her private secretary. DOCTOR
JOHN WALSH, her personal doctor. O'Brien and O'Donnell are
also present, along with DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MACNAMARA.
Everyone looks at the door. As it opens and closes we see
the hospital personnel carrying supplies and equipment for
the autopsy.
What follows unfolds in a splintered haze of grief...
A TV set blasts the news.
WALTER CRONKITE

The President was lying motionless
in the car. Mrs. Kennedy was
leaning over him fully. Connelly
was in the backseat holding his

room. But Bobby retrieves her...

They want a show of grief. They’re
already asking about funeral
arrangements!
Jackie storms towards the operating room.
At the last moment, right as the door opens and she sees the
body of her husband, she CRIES out -- and Bobby pulls her
back.
He holds her, consoling her.
Later -- everyone sits the waiting room, once again watching
the news.

INT. AMBULANCE (MOVING)- NIGHT
The ambulance carrying the PRESIDENT'S CASKET now winds
through the darkened streets of our nation's Capital.
Next to Jackie in the back of the ambulance, Bobby is in a
daze.
BOBBY
Lyndon's people are claiming I told
him to take the oath in Dallas.
Asshole couldn't wait and now
they’re blaming me for it.
Jackie looks out at the glowing MONUMENTS, passing rows of
AMERICAN FLAGS outside government offices, all flying at halfmast.
Suddenly Jackie lowers the glass barrier separating them from
the DRIVER.
JACKIE
(to Driver)
Excuse me. Do you know who James
Garfield was?
A beat of hesitation, confused.
No, Ma’am.

DRIVER

She looks to the Nurse.
JACKIE
Do you know who William McKinley
was? Or what he did?
No answer. The Driver glances back to Bobby, looking for
help, but none is coming.
JACKIE (CONT’D)

JACKIE
That’s right. Thank you.
Jackie raises the glass barrier. She turns to Bobby -JACKIE (CONT’D)
Bobby, please tell them I want the
books on Lincoln. About his
funeral.
Once again, they sit in silence.

INT. HALLWAY - KID’S ROOM - WHITE HOUSE
Jackie arrives at John Jr’s room. Carefully opens the door
and peeks in. He’s sleeping.
INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE
Jackie, alone, surveys her bedroom. Her WEDDING PHOTO sits
on one night-stand, PHOTOS OF JOHN JR and CAROLINE on the
other.
Finally, one button at-at-time, she undresses and the Chanel
Suit falls to the ground in a bloody heap.
She cries as she takes off her stained stockings.
She scrubs furiously at the blood under her nails.
She steps into the shower and the frosted glass door shuts
behind her.
She turns on the water. Blood races from her hair down her
back.

JACKIE
Do you want to be famous?

No I’m fine as I am, thank you.

BILL WALTON -- Jackie’s dear friend and cultural advisor -traces the route as he speaks.
WALTON
Lincoln’s funeral catafalque
departed the White House, and
progressed along Pennsylvania
Avenue to the Capitol.
Jackie stands next to him. Her fair skin pops dramatically
against her chic black dress -- accidentally the most
beautiful widow in the world.
WALTON (CONT’D)
The next day it returned to the
White House, and then they walked
all the way to St. Matthew’s in a
long, grand procession. It was a
sunny spring day. Only six hundred
tickets were allotted, but
thousands lined the streets and
rooftops. Citizens, Senators,
Congressman, Diplomats and Officers
-- all in their full dress
uniforms.
Walton picks up a photograph.
WALTON (CONT’D)
Lincoln’s mount, ‘Old Bob’ was
draped in a black blanket with
white trim and tassels. Hooded, he
was led riderless at the head of a
miles-long procession by the
Reverend Henry Brown.

Jackie stops to examine a PAINTING of LINCOLN’S CASKET lying

Nancy takes Jackie's arm to comfort her.
NANCY
Oh dear. It doesn't matter what you
say. Just hug them and tell them it
will be okay.
INT. HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE
Jackie walks with Nancy toward her daughter's bedroom -- a
fierce determination in her eyes.
She is the executioner, about to kill her own children's
innocence.
She stops at the threshold of her daughter's bedroom, about
to barge in -- and stops cold.
INSIDE -- CAROLINE (5) and JOHN JR. (nearly 3) are drawing
with MAUD SHAW, their longtime nanny.
Jackie gives them one more moment, and then -INT. CAROLINE KENNEDY'S BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

with delighted squeals.
While Jackie embraces them, in hushed tones...
NANCY
What do they know?
MAUD
I tried to explain to Caroline last
night. She keeps asking for him.
But she doesn't understand.
Jackie hugs and kisses Caroline and John Jr., leading them to
the bedside so she can sit at eye-level with them.

CAROLINE
Mommy... Why are you dressed so
funny?
JACKIE
Something very sad has happened.
And this is how we dress when
something sad happens.
JOHN JR.
Mommy, where's Daddy?
JACKIE
Daddy won't be coming home.
Why not?

CAROLINE

Jackie struggles.
JACKIE
Daddy had to go see your baby
brother Patrick. In heaven.
Why?

CAROLINE

JACKIE
Because I'm here with you. And we
don't want Patrick to get lonely,
do we?
CAROLINE
But what about us?
JACKIE
Caroline, I need you to be a big

A very bad man hurt Daddy. Daddy

he can't. He has to go to heaven.
Some understanding is beginning to build.

Yes, of course you can, my love.

INT. EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE
The room has been transformed into a hall of mourning.
Walton has added some additional touches since the night
before -- looping BLACK CREPE along the molding, a catafalque
where the Shakespeare stage would have stood.
Jackie is seated with Caroline, John Jr, and Bobby.
(Present are once again Jackie's parents, Janet and Hugh
Auchincloss, and her half-brother JAMES AUCHINCLOSS. But the
KENNEDY CLAN is now also here in full. Bobby and Ethel,
TEDDY and JOAN, PAT and her husband PETER, and their mother
ROSE. Behind the family are close aides O'Brien, O'Donnell,
and Powers, along with their wives.)
John Jr, a restless boy, gets up and walks through the room
with a mischievous smile.
Bobby follows, scoops him up and returns him to their seats.
Jackie holds John Jr’s hand and pulls Caroline closer.
A beat -- as Jackie clocks the anguish and pity on the faces
around her. She lowers her eyes unable to bear it.

The immediate family has retired to the White House
Residence.
Jackie stands with Bobby and Rose, the matriarch of the
Kennedy clan. Caroline and John Jr. play with Maude nearby.
BOBBY
That was a beautiful mass.
Jackie is drained and exhausted. The adrenaline of the
previous day and night has long since worn off.
And now Bobby notices -- across the room, President Johnson's
aide, Jack Valenti, waits in the doorway.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
Excuse me, mother. Jackie.

As Bobby crosses the room and confers with Valenti, Jackie
remains in her reverie. Rose turns to her...

ROSE
You’ll need to pare it down, dear.
We can’t possibly accommodate all
these people at Brookline.
VALENTI

We need to discuss the funeral. We
all want to follow her lead. But,
we still don't know much about this

I'll talk to her, but she makes the

Averell Harriman owns at least four
properties in Georgetown. I'm sure
he could loan out one of them?
Jackie seems completely oblivious -NANCY
I'll ask Sarge to look into it.
I'm sure we have time. They can't
expect us to move immediately, can
they?
JANET
Of course not. Don't be silly.
And then suddenly -JACKIE
Lincoln's widow died destitute.
The others quiet, all turning to her.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
She moved back to Illinois. Had to
sell all her furniture. And the
Van Buren's and the Tyler's too.

She auctioned it off, piece-bypiece, just to keep a roof over her

No it was Lincoln's cabinet room.

JACKIE
Yes, they are. The most famous
one, of course, is the Lincoln bed.
It was bought by Mrs. Lincoln.
Along with the dressing bureaus,

He simply nods.

Walton turns to Metzler, who's holding a wooden STAKE.
Metzler hands him the stake, and Walton walks directly to a

Jackie now sits at her dressing table, Nancy trying to place

I used to worry that you might be
jealous of me.

Oh stop it.

Rejecting the trite consolation -JACKIE
That’s a terrible thing to say.
They both smile.
NANCY
But you do!
JACKIE
That’s a terrible, terrible thing

Nancy comforts her. Holds her.
NANCY
But you do. I’m sorry.

I’m sorry.

JACKIE
What will you do now?
NANCY
Oh, I’ll stay with you.
JACKIE
You won’t go anywhere?
NANCY
No, I’m not going anywhere. I don’t
have anywhere to go.
They share a welcome laugh.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Those kids are so lucky to have
you.
JACKIE

No, they’re not lucky at all.
They’re not lucky. I’m scared,

What are you insinuating? That I

No, of course not...
EXT. PORTICO - WHITE HOUSE - DAY
Jackie leads Caroline and John Jr out onto the PORTICO,
squinting in the mid-day sun.
She takes in the extraordinary scene.
The horse-drawn CAISSON carrying the President's flag-draped
CASKET is parked just before them, followed by a RIDERLESS
HORSE, and then a train of LIMOUSINES to carry the mourners.
In the lead is a DRUM CORPS.
The WHITE HOUSE DRIVE is lined by parallel rows of SOLDIERS
carrying the flags of the 50 states.
The WHITE HOUSE LAWN is crowded with CAMERA CREWS, REPORTERS,

FLASHBULBS erupt, capturing the indelible image... The widow
in black. The two innocent children in powder blue. They
are still, and now frozen in time.

She charges toward him. He hangs up the phone -JACKIE
They murdered him!! Inside the

BOBBY
We didn't know any of the details.

I lie awake at night and all I can

ugly man.
The Priest studies her -- considers the depth of her
suffering. He tries one more time to get through -PRIEST
Let me share with you a parable.
(beat)
Jesus once passed a blind beggar on
the road, and his disciples asked -‘Who sinned, this man or his
parents, that he should be born
blind?’
(beat)
Jesus answered - ‘Neither this man
nor his parents sinned. He was
made blind so that the works of God
could be revealed in him.’
(beat)
And with that, he placed mud on the
man’s eyes and told him to wash in
the Pool of Siloam.’ The man did,
and he came back seeing.

Right now you are blind. Not
because you’ve sinned.

Jackie is on her knees, in a new black dress, freshly
showered, but still groggy.
She is surrounded by the RESOLUTE DESK, which John Jr was
famously photographed playing beneath.
The COCONUT the PRESIDENT used to scrawl a rescue message
when his boat was sunk in the South Pacific.
The MODEL of the naval vessel, The Danmark, he meticulously
constructed.
And finally -- the ROCKING CHAIR where he used to sit, the
children playing at his feet.
She runs her hand across the NEW CARPET, pleased.

It's perfect.

Walton stands in the doorway.

She trails off.

And then--

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Who knows if he would have cared.
She laughs, bitterly.

I lost track, somewhere. What was
real. What was performance.
WALTON
Well, he was a President.

You were right earlier.

I've told them I'm not going to
march tomorrow. I won't put people

WALTON
I was scared for you. I still am.
But I never thought it was vanity.
Jackie gestures to the redecorated room -JACKIE
You know, that's what Jack called

Do you think Lincoln’s widow knew?
What?

Bobby doesn’t answer.
JACKIE (CONT’D)
Why is this room so peaceful?
A long pause.

Peaceful?

Every time I walk by this room I’m
reminded that on January 1, 1863,
an ordinary man signed a document

So I don’t think of it so much as
‘peaceful’, but as a place of
profound legacy.

I said I've changed my mind. We
will have the procession. And I
will walk to the Cathedral. With
the casket.
Valenti is stunned.
VALENTI
Well even if we could resume the
arrangements, I'm sure you can
understand... The Secret Service
still has their concerns.
JACKIE
And President Johnson?
VALENTI
President Johnson would like
nothing more than to fulfill your
wishes. But, I have to take into
account his safety. The country
couldn't endure another blow should
anything-He catches himself.

I didn't mean...
If it were up to him, he'd do
anything that might bring you
comfort.

give her more than that.
VALENTI (CONT’D)
We've intercepted a threat against
General De Gaulle. From our assets

I’m afraid if he refuses to march,
others may follow.
Jackie considers this.

there were more we could do to
accommodate your wishes.

I’m terribly sorry.
Jackie seems to accept this.

Good day, Mrs. Kennedy.
Jackie turns to go -- then stops in the doorway.

when they land?
Not sure where this is going -Of course.

VALENTI

JACKIE
Inform them that I will walk with
Jack tomorrow.

Alone if necessary.

It was a funeral for the President

JOURNALIST
Your husband drove cars, he didn’t
ride horses.
An outburst -JACKIE
Yes and there should have been more

more horses, more soldiers, more
crying, more cameras!
JOURNALIST
I’m guessing you won’t allow me to
write any of that?
JACKIE
No, because I never said that.
(beat)
Perhaps Jack didn’t have time to
defeat Communism-JOURNALIST

President and Lady Bird Johnson.
Behind them is a pantheon of foreign leaders. De Gaulle,
EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE of Ethiopia, PRINCE PHILLIP, DUKE OF
EDINBURGH, SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER ANASTAS MIKOYAN, JEAN
MONNET and others.
It is an extraordinary gathering -- manifest only through
Jackie’s force of will.
A long beat, as she takes it all in. In her eyes -- the
faintest hint of pride behind the sadness.
Finally, Jackie steps forward and takes her place between
Bobby and Ted. She wears a veil over her face -- and the
BLACK WATCH PIPERS begin their plaintive dirge...
The caisson lurches forward, pulled by a train of WHITE
STALLIONS, and the grim parade begins...
As they exit the White House Gates, Jackie looks down
PENNSYLVANIA and for the first time comes face-to-face with
the scope of the nation's sorrow.
All the way to the distant horizon, the sidewalks are
overflowing with MOURNERS.

President grips his throat. She's about to reach for him-And BANG! -- she is showered in BLOOD and GRAY MATTER as his
head explodes all over her.
EXT. PARK - OUTSIDE, WASHINGTON DC
JACKIE
I could have saved him.
EXT. PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE - DALLAS
Jackie panics -- climbing out of her seat, onto the back of
the still-moving car.
She claws her way to the rear-bumper, hanging on for her
life.
EXT. PARK - OUTSIDE, WASHINGTON DC
JACKIE
I should have known it was a
gunshot. I should have shielded
him.
INTERCUT -EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY
Bagpipers march. Marines stand in formation.
JACKIE (O.S.)
I tried to stop the bleeding. But
by the time we got to the hospital
it was...
She stands, watching through her black veil.
EXT. PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE
CLOSE ON Jackie -- back in the car, where her husband’s body
is slumped over, BLOOD pooling everywhere.

75.
Jackie resists, but Hill shoves her down into the carnage,
shielding her body with his.
Jackie lies prone, sandwiched between Hill and her dying
husband -- trapped in an unspeakable, visceral horror.
Jackie reaches out for Jack’s head -- and tries to hold
together his shattered skull.
We stay with her -- as the car now accelerates toward the
hospital.
EXT. PARK - OUTSIDE, WASHINGTON DC
JACKIE
That night, and every night
since... I’ve prayed to die.
EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY
The casket is carried through the mourners gathered.
JACKIE (O.S.)
Won’t God let me be with my
husband?
Marines fold the flag and hand it to her.
She stands staring at the casket. Remembering the horror of
the limo as it sped with his head in her hands.
The casket is lowered.
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
Jackie sits with the Journalist.
JACKIE
Can I look?
She slides Field’s notes to her side of the table.
JOURNALIST
It’s just, I haven’t-JACKIE
--You don’t write very legibly, do
you?
He watches her read.

76.
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - KITCHEN - LATER
The Journalist paces as Jackie rewrites furiously.
JOURNALIST
You left your mark on this country,
Mrs. Kennedy. These past few
days...That’s the story.
(long beat)
Losing a President is like losing a
father. And you were a mother to
all of us. And that’s a very good
story.
(beat)
The entire country watched the
funeral from beginning to end.
Decades from now, people will
remember your dignity, and the
majesty...
(beat)
They’ll remember you.
CUT TO:
INT. MONROE ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1962)
Collingswood and Jackie have reached the end of the tour -the Monroe Room on the second floor.
JACKIE
It will serve a definite purpose.
(beat)
My husband has so many meetings up
here, in this part of the house.
All the men who wait to see him,
now sit in the hall, with baby
carriages going by them. So they
can sit in here and have a
conference around this table,
waiting for him.
COLLINGSWOOD
Well, he’s going to come in and-PRESIDENT KENNEDY -- handsome, resplendent -- enters the
room.
COLLINGSWOOD (CONT’D)
(excited)
Mister president...
They shake hands.

77.
PRESIDENT KENNEDY
Mister Collingswood.
COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs. Kennedy has been showing us
about the White House and all the
changes she has made therein. What
do you think of the changes that
she’s made?
PRESIDENT KENNEDY
Well, I think that the great effort
she’s made has been to bring us
much more intimately in contact
with all the men who lived here. Of
course, I think anyone who comes to
the White House as a President
desires the best for his country.
CUT TO:
INT. STAIRWAY - WHITE HOUSE
Nancy leads Jackie down the stairs, out of the White House
for the last time...
PRESIDENT KENNEDY (O.S.)
And I think he receives stimulus
from the knowledge of living in
close proximity to the people who
are legendary but who actually were
alive and were in these rooms.
Jackie notices -- down the hallway, Lady Bird reviews new
fabric swatches with Walton.
Walton catches her glance. A hint of shame in his eyes -but this is no longer her home.
Jackie looks down and exits.
EXT. PORTICO - WHITE HOUSE - DAY
Caroline and John Jr head into a waiting limousine.
All around them, the chaos of the MOVERS continues.
NANCY
Everything will be held in storage
until you decide where to settle.
The two women embrace. Jackie finally enters the car.

78.
She looks back through the window to the home she devoted so
much of her life.
Echoing the first scene of the White House tour -- Nancy
encourages her to smile.
CUT TO:
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
The Journalist watches Jackie from across the room.
JACKIE
There’s one last thing -- more
important than all the rest...
(beat)
You know every night before bed, we
had this old Victrola. We'd listen
to a couple records. And his
favorite was Camelot.
JOURNALIST
The musical?
JACKIE
Oh, I'm so ashamed of myself.
Every quote out of Jack’s mouth was
either Greek or Roman. And that
last song, that last side of
Camelot is all that keeps running
through my mind.
(beat)
"Don't let it be forgot, that for
one brief shining moment there was
a Camelot."
CUT TO:
INT. BALL ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1961)
A boisterous, glamorous party is in full swing. Jackie laughs
in a red regal dress with elbow-length white gloves.
President Kennedy grabs her hand and they dance.
JACKIE (O.S.)
Jack loved history. It’s what made
him what he was. Imagine him...
this little boy, with scarlet fever
in bed, reading history.
(beat)
(MORE)

79.
JACKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
King Arthur and the Knights of the
Round Table. That’s what Camelot
is about. Ordinary men banding
together to fight for a better
world. Don't misunderstand me...
(beat)
Jack wasn't naive. But, he had
ideals. Ideals he could rally
others to believe in.
CUT TO:
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
JOURNALIST
And will those ideals live on?
JACKIE
I’m sure they will. Of course
there will be other great
Presidents. The Johnson's have
been so generous to me.
(beat)
But there won't be another Camelot.
Not another Camelot.
CUT TO:
EXT.

PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON, DC

The Priest and Jackie sit at an impasse, their talk coming to
an end with no resolution.
Slowly and deliberately, the Priest’s face darkens -- his
tone sharpening.
PRIEST
Why are you really here?
An awkward silence, Jackie taken aback-JACKIE
I--I needed to talk.
PRIEST
You say you pray every night to
die. That your children have no
use for you. That you wish only to
be with your husband.
(beat)
And yet -- I’m not burying you
today.
(beat)
(MORE)

80.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
There comes a time in man’s search
for meaning, when one realizes -there are no answers.
(beat)
When you come to that horrible,
unavoidable realization -- you
accept it. Or you kill yourself.
Or you simply stop searching.
Jackie is reeling-PRIEST (CONT’D)
I have lived a blessed life. And
yet every night when I climb into
bed, turn off the lights, and stare
into the dark, I wonder...is this
all there is?
Jackie’s tone softens -- the Priest’s honesty finally getting
through to her...
JACKIE
You wonder?
The Priest nods -PRIEST
Every soul on this planet does.
INTERCUT -EXT. HYANNIS BEACH - DAY
Jackie playfully runs after Caroline and John Jr.
PRIEST (O.S.)
And then, when morning comes, we
all wake up and make a pot of
coffee.
JACKIE (O.S.)
Why do we bother?
She catches up to John Jr and picks him up. Twirls him.
PRIEST (O.S.)
Because we do. You did this
morning, and you will again
tomorrow.
Jackie stops to watch her laughing children.

81.
PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
God, in his infinite wisdom, has
made sure...it is just enough for
us.
Jackie looks on as Caroline and John Jr build sand castles
under gray skies.
CUT TO:
INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM
The Journalist dictates his article to his editor...
JOURNALIST (INTO PHONE)
Once more... Mrs. Kennedy has
expressed her desire to reinter the
bodies of the two children they
lost to rest alongside their
father.
(beat)
You got that part, right?
(beat)
She wants them to always remember,
for one brief shining moment there
was a-- yeah, Camelot. Yeah.
Finally, the Journalist hangs up.
JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
I hope you have a good night, Mrs.
Kennedy.
A moment of silence between them.

And he exits.
CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - OUTSIDE, WASHINGTON DC - DUSK
Jackie relates to the Priest, with some satisfaction -JACKIE
He wrote down every word.
PRIEST
And did that help... Heal you?
Jackie thinks.

Not exactly an answer--

JACKIE
It’s been reprinted all over the
world.
(MORE)

82.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
Maybe that’s what they’ll all
believe now.
(beat)
Camelot.
(beat)
People like to believe in fairy
tales.
PRIEST
And you? Do you believe you’ve
done him justice?
Jackie can’t bring herself to say yes.

Instead --

JACKIE
I believe the characters we read
about on the page end up being more
real than the men who stand beside
us.
(beat)
I should have guessed it was too
much to ask that we grow old
together. See our children grow
up.
The Priest studies her -- hoping she’s slowly making her way
toward some semblance of solace.
But it’s clear -- she’s not yet there.
PRIEST
The darkness may never go away.
But it won’t always be this heavy.
Come. They’re waiting for us at
Arlington.
CUT TO:
EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DUSK
The Eternal Flame burns over President Kennedy’s grave -- two
fresh, small graves dug beside it.
Patrick Bouvier Kennedy. August 17, 1963 - August 19, 1963.
Daughter. 1956.
PRIEST
... the Father, the Son, the Holy
Spirit...

83.
Jackie watches another tiny casket lowered into the ground.
CUT TO:
INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE
Walton mounts a plaque outside Jackie’s bedroom.

It reads:

"In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his wife,
Jacqueline, during the two years, ten months, and two days he
was President of the United States: January 20, 1961 November 22, 1963."
CUT TO:
I/E. JACKIE’S MOTORCADE - WASHINGTON, DC - NIGHT
Jackie looks out the window at the now-quiet streets.
We hear Camelot begin to play...
“Each evening from December to December, before you drift to
sleep upon your cot / Think back on all the tales that you
will remember...of Camelot...”
The limo slows and Jackie notices:
Across the street -- A MAN is carrying a MANNEQUIN over his
shoulder.
Porcelain skin. Jet-black bouffant.
features.

Perfectly symmetrical

Jackie stares at a perfect plastic reproduction of herself.
A surreal, disorienting moment.
And then ANOTHER MAN, carrying another, identical, MANNEQUIN.
Jackie tracks them back to a nearby TRUCK -- where WORKERS
unload DOZENS more of them.
The workers carry the dolls into a MACY’S DEPARTMENT STORE.
In the store windows -- STYLISTS dress the mannequins in
reproductions of the outfits Jackie has been wearing for the
past five days.
Jackie stares in disbelief at her own image frozen in time,
the widow, forever in mourning.

84.
INT. DINING ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1962)
Jackie and Collingswood continue their tour in front of the
cameras. (Camelot continues to play...)
JACKIE
I’m just so happy that he could be
proud. Because then I was having a
baby and I couldn’t campaign and
then we got in the White House and
all the things I’d always done,
suddenly they became wonderful.
And I was just so happy for Jack
that he could be proud of me.
(beat)
Those were our happiest years.
INT. EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE (1961)
Jackie is seated between President Kennedy and Bobby.
Pablo Casals finishes his performance of Felix Mendelssohn's
Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor, Op. 49.
A standing ovation.
Jackie gives Casals her gloved hand to kiss.
INT. BALL ROOM - WHITE HOUSE
Jackie dances in her red dress with President Kennedy.
She rests her head on his shoulder as Camelot finally
crescendoes. She smiles.
