ACROSS THE ROOM, ROSS IS STRETCHED OUT, SPRAWLED ACROSS
RACHEL ON THE COUCH. HE IS PASSED OUT.
RACHEL
(TO PHOEBE)

Pheebs, could you

maybe hand me a cracker?
ACROSS THE ROOM, MONICA IS SITTING ON THE COUCH. SHE
HOLDS A WINE GLASS. AFTER A MOMENT, HER MOTHER SITS
NEXT TO HER. SHE IS DRINKING WINE AS WELL.
JUDY
Your grandmother would have hated
this.
MONICA
Well... sure. What with it being
her funeral and all.
JUDY SMILES.
JUDY
No, I'd be hearing about why didn't
I get the honey glazed ham.

Or

about how I didn't spend enough on
flowers.

And if I spent more,

she'd be saying, "Why are you
wasting your money?
flowers.

I don't need

I'm dead."
MONICA

Nana.

That sounds like

JUDY
Do you know what-it's like to grow
up with someone who is critical of
every single thing you do?
MONICA
I... can imagine.

I'm telling you, it's a wonder your
mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person she
is.

So, tell me something. Mom.

If you had it to do all over
again —

I mean, if she was here

right now —

would you tell her?
JUDY

Tell her what?
MONICA
How she drove you crazy, picking on
every little detail, like, I don't
know...

your hair?

For example?

JUDY
(UNEASILY, AS SHE REACHES FOR HER
WINE)

I'm not sure I know what

you're getting at.
MONICA
Do you think things would've been
better if you'd just told her the
truth?
THERE'S A LONG BEAT AS JUDY CONSIDERS THIS. CLEARLY
SHE IS AWARE THAT MONICA IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT MONICA
AND JUDY, NOT JUDY AND NANA. FINALLY, JUDY'S EYES
NARROW.
JUDY
(CAREFULLY)

No.

I think some

things are better left unsaid.

I

think it's nicer when people just
get along.
MONICA
(SMILING IN SPITE OF HERSELF)

Huh.

JUDY
More wine, dear?
MONICA
(LAUGHING)

Oh, I think so.

JUDY REFILLS THEIR GLASSES. MONICA ABSENTLY PUSHES HER
HAIR BACK BEHIND HER EARS. INSTINCTIVELY, JUDY REACHES
TO CORRECT THIS WHEN, SUDDENLY, SHE REALIZES WHAT SHE'S
DOING. SHE HESITATES, THEN CHANGES HER TACK.

Those earrings look really lovely
on you.
MONICA
(WITH A SMILE)

Thank you.

They

were yours.
JUDY
Actually, they were Nana's.
BOTH WOMEN SMILE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE IS A CRY FROM
THE GUYS WATCHING THE GAME.
ALL THE GUYS
No!

What the hell was that??

Threw it away!
JACK
Now I'm depressed.
THE ENTIRE ROOM TURNS AND LOOKS AT HIM.
JACK (CONT'D)

THE GROUP IS GOING THROUGH A BOX OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
MONICA HOLDS ONE UP AND SHOWS THE GROUP.

RACHEL
Oh, look a the little thing...
ROSS
Yes.

Fine.

That is my penis.

CHANDLER IS LOOKING AT ANOTHER PICTURE.

That's Nana in the middle there.

RACHEL
Wow.

Monica, you look just like

your grandmother.

How old was she

here?
MONICA/ROSS
"1939".
MONICA
Yeah, urn, twenty-four, twenty-five.
ROSS
It looks like a fun gang.
THEY ALL STARE AT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THIS OTHER GROUP OF
FRIENDS. THERE IS A LONG PAUSE. THEN:
JOEY
(HOLDING UP A PICTURE)

Ooh, look.

I got Monica naked.
ROSS
(SHEEPISHLY)

Uh, no.

That would

be me again.

I'm, uh... just

trying something.
AS THEY ALL LEAN OVER TO LOOK AT THE PICTURE...
FADE OUT.

CHANDLER

LOWELL

Oh, hey, Chandler.
CHANDLER
So, how's it going down there in
Financial Services?
LOWELL
It's like Mardi Gras without the
papier mache heads. How 'bout you?
CHANDLER
Good, good.

Listen, urn... I don't

but, uh... I'm not.
LOWELL

LOWELL

Speaking for my

By the way.

Your friend
He is.

CHANDLER
He is?
LOWELL
Yup.

And waaay out of your league.

LOWELL EXITS. AS CHANDLER RETRIEVES HIS PAPER FROM
