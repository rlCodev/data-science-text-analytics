SOUND OF METAL

written by
Darius Marder and Abraham Marder

HE HEARS HEAVY FEEDBACK, BUILDING AND SQUEALING...
INT. CLUB STAGE - NIGHT
Harsh white lights illuminate RUBEN (40), beady eyes, punklike, weathered boyish face and tattoos everywhere. He's
waiting, intensely, for the beginning, for it all to start.
He looks up and his focus locks in tight on Lou (30) an
assured, freak, creature dressed in black, with an air of
royalty about her. The loop of her sound grows. Guitar pedals
and synthesizers lay on the stage floor as she looks to Ruben
with a suddenly manic intensity. She picks up her beat up
Telecaster and strikes a chord with surprising menace. She
stomps on her looping pedal. The sound hisses low, wild and
bracing. Ruben stares and waits, poised... he can almost
taste her sweat. She flashes a quick glance toward him and
Ruben unleashes, bringing the sticks down upon his drums with
pure demonic ecstasy. Lou leans in towards the microphone,
relishing the moment. Her desperate and distorted scream
fills the hall. The whites of Ruben’s eyes flash as if
igniting an erotic charge, this glorious being, merging with
him. Sweat drips from Ruben’s hair and his eyes burn in an
endless climax... or pain.
SOUND OF METAL
INT. AIRSTREAM - MORNING
We hear the slightest whistle of a breeze... a squeak...
subtle noises from the outside world as...
Ruben sits up suddenly and looks around a small, oddly shaped
room at the back end of an old Airstream trailer. He looks
down at Lou as if expecting her to be gone. She’s asleep and
immediately unrecognizable from her severe on-stage persona.
He stares at her pale, unmade face, eyes closed... he
imagines her dreams, complex, dark and rich with meaning.
Ruben listens...A leaf blower outside in the distance. he
gets up.
He pulls open the window curtain over a tiny dining table.
The morning light blinds his eyes and illuminates the
interior of the AIRSTREAM. This is the living, kitchen,
dining and war room of an obsessed audiophile. Instruments,
cords, mixing boards, reel-to-reel tape recorders, mics, all
tightly hung and fit into the tiny space. Sound equipment
coexists with other items of kitsch collected over years of
nomadic living.
Ruben peers out the window. He looks for signs of danger,
anything...

2.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MORNING
The SOUND OF COFFEE DRIPPING AND GURGLING into a coffee pot.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben packs green vegetables and spices into a blender. He
presses his hand down and the blender THRASHES LOUDLY.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben performs his daily stretches and pushups.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben, with laser focus, cleans out some electrical equipment
with compressed air... fastidious... borderline OCD...
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben places a record on a turntable and a surprisingly
tender, blues song from the 1920's plays. Ruben slowly turns
up the volume.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben makes breakfast, sets food and smoothies on the small
dining table.
Lou!

RUBEN

INT. AIRSTREAM - MORNING
Ruben walks from the living room to the back of the
airstream. He looks at Lou sleeping...
Hey Lulu.

RUBEN

No response. Ruben stares. He grabs a pair of drum sticks and
sits on the bed next to her. With great focus, he begins to
slowly drum a beat on the backs of covered thighs... this
goes on for a minute before Lou groans sleepily... the rhythm
picks up steam. Ruben’s drumming and sound effects grow
louder and faster... He’s in full drum solo now...
Stop...

LOU

3.
He doesn’t stop.
Stop it.
Up time.
No.

LOU (CONT'D)
RUBEN
LOU

Ruben looks at Lou still face down in bed. He glances at her
scratching her arm aggressively in one raw spot. Above this
spot we see the scars where once she cut herself.
RUBEN
Hey stop that. We got to get right
to it. Lulu ... For grizzle.
Ruben holds a smoothie. He drinks it.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Yo, I got some smoothie for you.
your gonna fuckin hate it, but it's
healthy. Want some?
Lou stares.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I wouldn't recommend it. It's
disgusting.
Lou nods lifelessly.
Ruben slurps the smoothie.
RUBEN
Okay, poops.

(CONT'D)

Lou moans.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Dance time.
EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING
Wide shot of a vast Walmart parking lot somewhere, anywhere
in America. Ruben stands, barefoot, in his underwear, on the
asphalt. He squints at the wasteland of suburban nothingness.

4.
INT. AIRSTREAM - LATER
Close intimate shot of Ruben and Lou dancing together to a
1960's soul song. Ruben is silly enough that Lou finally
laughs. This is their routine.
EXT. AIRSTREAM - DAY
The airstream flies by into the endless, rolling, American
landscape.
INT. AIRSTREAM - LATER
Ruben drives and Lou sits in the passenger seat.
LOU AND RUBEN
(Singing in deep voices)
And I would do anything FOR LOVE!
But I won't do that.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
What's left for him to not do?
Anal.

LOU

(Singing again)
No no- but I won't do that.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben and Lou still talking and driving as overpasses fly by
on the highway.
RUBEN
I use to imagine Jeff Goldbloom was
my Dad. I saw him in The fucking
Fly- I was like that must be what
my Dad looks like. Also explains a
lot because the dudes fucking
weird. But he looks like me man.
LOU
It's true. Yeah.
YEAH!

RUBEN

LOU
You kind of look like Jeff
Goldbloom.

5.
INT. AIRSTREAM - LATER
Ruben and Lou still driving.
RUBEN
Why is it okay to use a toothpick
in public but not floss? Have you
ever tried that?
LOU
To floss my teeth in public?
RUBEN
To floss- you're just at the dinner
table andNo-

LOU

RUBEN
-you pull out some floss and shit?
INT. AIRSTREAM - LATER
Ruben and Lou drive through a inner city.
LOU
I used to imagine my funeral a lot
when I was a kid. At school, in
math.
FUN.

RUBEN

LOU
I used to day dream about my
funeral then I'd make myself cry.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Still driving.
LOU
Uh yeah- I think I'd get cremated
what about you?
RUBEN
Cremated or like just fed to the
birds, you know?

6.
LOU
Well you know now you can get ashes
put into tattoo ink. My face on
your back where the clown is.
What?!
Yeah.

RUBEN
LOU

RUBEN
(Singing)
Scary clown face. Scary clown face.
INT. SILO CLUB - DAY
Ruben and Lou set up their funky version of a MERCH TABLE.
Lou talks with ANOTHER MEMBER OF A BAND while Ruben sets out
various spray painted pieces of original art and a stack of
vinyl to sell. Suddenly, out of nowhere, A RINGING SOUND
enters Ruben’s ears... he tilts his head as if trying to
dislodge it... Ruben stands frozen, waiting for the sound to
abate. It doesn't. He looks at Lou. She looks up at him and
smiles. He looks away.
INT. SILO CLUB - STAGE - NIGHT
On stage, Ruben slams away at his drums in deep concentration
as Lou screams torturously in the background. We push toward
him as the RINGING SOUND again takes over and then gives way
to a LOW VIBRATIONAL, THUMPING OF HIS DRUMS.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MORNING
MUFFLED QUIETNESS. Ruben’s eyes open painfully... The trace
of daylight coming through the closed curtain... He turns
anxiously glancing at Lou’s peaceful face, asleep on the
pillow... He pulls himself out of bed, very carefully so as
not to wake Lou and enters the bathroom... he studies his
ears in the mirror, almost expecting to find a bug or
creature hiding inside.
He makes A NOISE IN HIS THROAT. It registers in his ears as
DAMP AND MUFFLED.
He COUGHS. MUFFLED.

7.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben takes a quick shower... lost in worry... The SOUND OF
THE WATER is just barely audible.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MORNING
The MUFFLED SOUND OF COFFEE DRIPPING into a coffee pot.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
The MUFFLED SOUND OF A BLENDER.
INT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Lou watches the hood shut from the passenger seat. She
studies Ruben, wearing headphones, as he makes his way to the
door and into the Airstream. She notes his odd, vacant
state... he glances at her nervously as he starts the engine.
You okay?

LOU

Ruben can't hear, doesn't respond as he pulls forward, looks
at her and musters an incongruous smile.
INT. CELLAR ROOM CLUB - AFTERNOON
Ruben sweats profusely as he finishes loading in the last of
Lou's 3 giant amplifiers... he glances at Lou as she begins
sound check... increased panic... he starts walking off
stage... turns back to Lou...
RUBEN
Lulu... gotta run around the corner
and grab something.
Lou says something back to him but he can’t hear.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I'll just be sec ok?
He turns awkwardly and exits...
INT. PHARMACY - AFTERNOON
Ruben frantically walks toward a pharmacy counter and waits
for the PHARMACIST to finish talking to someone.

8.
PHARMACIST
Can I help you find something?
What?

RUBEN

PHARMACIST
Can I help you?
Ruben moves toward him. He doesn’t want to talk for fear he’s
talking too loud. He overcompensates by talking too softly.
RUBEN
Um. I’m having a funny thing with
my ears today.
Pardon me?

PHARMACIST

RUBEN
I’m having a problem with my ears.
The pharmacist nods.
PHARMACIST
And what’s going on?
RUBEN
What was that?
PHARMACIST
(loudly)
What’s going on with your ears?
RUBEN
Oh uh... It’s a ringing andPHARMACIST
Uh huh. In both ears?
The pharmacist speaks up and gestures to both ears.
BOTH EARS?

PHARMACIST (CONT'D)

INT. PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben watches the pharmacist making a phone call. He looks at
his phone, sees that texts have come in from Lou. He switches
his phone to vibrate then looks up to see the pharmacist
motioning and giving him a thumbs up.

9.
PHARMACIST
Can you go now? He can see you
right now.
Ruben stares.
NOW.

PHARMACIST (CONT'D)

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
Ruben sits and waits, texts that he's dealing with some shit
but not to worry. A NURSE CALLS HIS NAME. He doesn't hear.
She taps him on the shoulder, startling him.
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SOUND BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben sits in a sound booth. He is terribly nervous and
totally claustrophobic... He drums his fingers on his pants.
A DOCTOR enters the booth and helps him put headphones on. He
leaves and shuts the door behind him. Ruben's breathing
increases. Then he hears A LOUD, VOICE.
DOCTOR
You hear me in both ears?
What?...

RUBEN

Ruben now has headphones on. The doctor sits in the
foreground.
DOCTOR
Okay we’re just going to get
started in your right ear okay?
Ruben looks confused.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
What I want is for you to repeat
the words back to me. They’re going
to stay at this level I just want
the last word back okay?
Sorry?

RUBEN

DOCTOR
REPEAT THEM... THE WORDS, OKAY?
JUST REPEAT THEM.
Ruben nods.

10.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Say the word base.
Mm....

RUBEN

The doctor moves on quickly. Ruben get’s increasingly more
nervous.
DOCTOR
Say the word mess.
RUBEN
Uh... Bent?
DOCTOR
Say the word cause.
...Cars?

RUBEN

DOCTOR
Say the word mop.
RUBEN
... Not sure.
Mop.

DOCTOR

Ruben can’t speak. He laughs nervously.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Say the word youth.
Ruben scratches his head...
INT. AUDIOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY
The doctor goes over to a shelf and takes out some headphones
and hands them to Ruben. He gestures for Ruben to put them
on. He does...
DOCTOR
Can you hear me?
The doctors voice is small, tinny and distant as he speaks
into the microphone.
RUBEN
Hear you?... Yeah, kind of.
Ruben presses his hands against the headphones to hear.

11.
DOCTOR
(loud and clear)
This music you play; this is how
you make your living?
Yes sir.

RUBEN

DOCTOR
Okay that’s ah... that’s an issue.
Ruben stares... shocked.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Is this particularly loud music
you’re playing?
Loud?...

RUBEN

The doctor gets Ruben's chart. Looks it over and then holds
it up for Ruben.
DOCTOR
These are your charts Ruben.
Normal speech discrimination is 100
percent. You were under 30 percent
in the right and 25 in the left.
That meant that no matter how high
she turned up the volume, you still
missed 70 to 80 percent of the
words. That’s really ominous.
RUBEN
What was that?
DOCTOR
OMINOUS, not good.
RUBEN
Ah... Okay? So... What’s the deal?
How do I get it back?
The doctor nods slowly.
Well-

DOCTOR

RUBEN
I mean, its normal or what?

12.
DOCTOR
No not at all normal. Sudden
hearing loss is common enough by
itself, and certainly with the sort
noise you’ve exposed yourself to it
needs to be considered but in your
case with both ears and this level
of severity we need to look to a
number of other possible causes as
well - can I ask, do have any
hereditary auto immune issues in
your family that you’re aware of?
Ruben’s confused...
RUBEN
What? I don’t knowDOCTOR
How’s your parents health... or
grandparents?
Ruben stares intensely.
I'm sorry?

RUBEN

DOCTOR
The reason I ask Ruben is that it
could help us determine whether
this might be a disease or notHuh?

RUBEN

DOCTOR
Are you having any joint pain
lately?
RUBEN
What? In my ears?
DOCTOR
Mr. Davis I’m trying to help you
get to the bottom of thisRUBEN
IT'S NOT A DISEASE. I just need to
figure our something uh- What can
you give me to help clear this out
a little?

13.
DOCTOR
I don’t follow.
RUBEN
I mean is there a medication kind
of thing to put in my ear and clear
this out or what?
DOCTOR
Right... Ruben...
(sighs)
I understand this is all quite
shocking for you but I need you to
understand something. Whether this
is somehow a result of over
exposure to noise or it’s an
autoimmune issue, your hearing is
deteriorating very rapidly. Right?
Well-

RUBEN

DOCTOR
And over the next days or even
hours it will likely get worseRUBEN
Dude, I’m asking you what can I do?
DOCTOR
First thing, as a precaution is I
would absolutely eliminate exposure
to loud noises. Then once we have
run some tests and identified
exactly what is going on with your
ears we can have some other
conversationsRUBEN
What other conversations? About
what?
DOCTOR
Well in the event of permanent loss
there are procedures we can
discussRUBEN
Like what? What procedures?
DOCTOR
Like for instance. Cochlear
Implants-

14.
RUBEN
What are those?
DOCTOR
Cochlear implants?
RUBEN
Yeah what are they? They work?
DOCTOR
They can be very effective for
people with severe hearing loss or
complete deafness yesRUBEN
Uh huh. So let’s do that then.
The doctor chuckles.
DOCTOR
Well not so simple. There are many
details and it’s quite costly.
What?

RUBEN

DOCTOR
(loudly)
EXPENSIVE.
RUBEN
How much? Like what general kind of
price?
DOCTOR
Well they range between 40 and 80
thousand depending... and
unfortunately they’re not covered
by insurance.
Ruben nods slowly.
RUBEN
Okay... and when could this happen?
Do you have them... in stock?
Ruben stares at the doctor...
DOCTOR
Cochlear implants? No Ruben that’s
a very involved process as well as
an invasive surgery. But once we’ve
identified the issues we can have
that conversation. Okay?
(MORE)

15.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
As I said before; the one thing you
should be focused on right now is
protecting what hearing you have
left...
Rubens stares lifelessly.
HARD CUT:
INT. THE CELLAR ROOM, STAGE - LATER
Red lights strobe on Ruben’s sweat ridden face as he crushes
his sticks against the drums. He tries to hold on to an
impossibly thin thread of sound. As we move closer into
Ruben’s eyes we see a deep well of hurt... The strobing
lights continue, illuminating flashes of Ruben’s face in
various poses of demonic ecstasy and pain... The song builds
as Ruben hits harder and harder... Suddenly, the crackle of
sound breaks up... Ruben’s no longer hearing Lou or his own
drums. His drumming and Lou’s playing is suddenly out of
sync. She looks back at him, abruptly broken out of her
spell, her eyes full of confusion. Ruben panics. He continues
to play in shock - staring hard at Lou, trying desperately to
hold on to her rhythm and his place in the song, his place in
the world. She looks at him closely as she plays the final
chord. Ruben glances at the crowd, paranoid, devastated in
his horrible, emerging silence. He stops playing, puts down
his sticks. Lou is shocked. Ruben gets up and pushes his way
through the crowd, down a hall, up stairs and bursts out into
an ally... no sound... the world has gone silent. He stares,
terrified and alone... his hands shake.... He whips around
feeling a hand on his shoulder. Lou is standing there. She
reacts immediately to his demeanor. She speaks but Ruben
doesn’t hear...
LOU (SILENT)
What the fuck? What happened?
Ruben stares at her voiceless screams... unresponsive... Lou
can see Ruben's pain. She is crying now...
LOU (CONT'D)
Rubi, what’s happening? What’s
wrong?
Ruben looks at her, total terror in his eyes... he speaks but
can’t hear his own voice...
RUBEN
I can't hear anything.

16.
INT. DINER - NIGHT
Close up of coffee spinning in a mug. Lou, still in her
concert outfit, looks at Ruben as he twirls his glass. She
writes on a piece of paper with a shaky hand: WILL IT COME
BACK?... And slides it to Ruben... Ruben reads, trying to act
calm...
RUBEN
It will when I get surgery...
There’s an implant thing. The put
it in your shit. It’s fine. It’s
easy. Forty grand or Eighty or
something... so, but... yeahRuben glances up to catch Lou’s freshly heartbroken face...
tears running down her cheeks... she tries to pull herself
together. She stares at Ruben’s hand tapping nervously...
RUBEN (CONT'D)
We just gotta figure it out. We’ll
play tomorrow night and see how it
goes. I’ll just be like a click
track, you can play to meLou tries to speakRUBEN (CONT'D)
It'll be different but it is what
it is.
Lou stares at Ruben like he’s an alien.
Um-No.

LOU

She writes on a scrap of paper: WE’RE NOT PLAYING ANYTHING
RUBEN. Slides it to Ruben... he reads.
RUBEN
Yes we are playing. We are.
Lou puts up her hands as if to say “What are you talking
about?”
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Lou. We have a fucking tour booked.
No.

LOU

RUBEN
YES. ACTUALLY YES WE DO. WE HAVE A
TOUR BOOKED.

17.
Lou looks anxiously at Ruben while at the same time massaging
a quickly building pain in her stomach. Ruben pulls at his
hair, unable to be in his skin. He SEES A GUY outside smoking
a cigarette and he abruptly stands up from the table trying
to break himself out of his daze.
Be back.

RUBEN (CONT'D)

Lou watches Ruben walk away with deep concern in her eyes.
She picks at her food alone, suppressing tears as she HEARS
RUBEN outside ASKING SOMEONE FOR A SMOKE.
EXT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben takes the last sucks of a cigarette. His hands shake
and his eyes dart around. He flicks the cigarette before
heading back toward the diner.
INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben picks at his food... Lou stares at him.
LOU
Were you?
(gesturing)
Smoking?
Ruben shrugs. Lou writes.
LOU (CONT'D)
What the fuck!
Lou seems surprisingly alarmed.
LOU (CONT'D)
We need to call Hector.
What?

RUBEN

Lou pantomimes calling and mouths the words HECTOR.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Why would I call Hector?
Lou stares.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Just cause I had a fucking
cigarette?
(Scratching head
furiously)
(MORE)

18.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I think even you’d probably have a
cigarette too, don’t you think?
Lou looks around... Ruben’s being really loud.
What?

RUBEN (CONT'D)

LOU
I don’t know.
What?!

RUBEN

LOU
Stop!! Relax...
RUBEN
COME AGAIN?
Lou looks at Ruben with frightened eyes ... Clearly scared...
she gets up and goes around to his side of the booth and sits
right next to him. She turns to him and takes his face and
kisses his cheek and then she crosses her arm through his and
she writes as Ruben watches in real time: ANSWER TRUTHFULLY.
ARE YOU IN DANGER RIGHT NOW? Lou looks at Ruben... He looks
ahead stiffly shaking his head slightly, but doesn’t say
no... She writes: LET’S CALL HECTOR. Ruben shakes his head.
Lou writes PLEASE? - she underlines it and nods her head. She
writes GO.
Now?

RUBEN (CONT'D)

Lou nods her head.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
How am I gonna call Hector?
Lou motions to get on with it. Ruben takes out his phone and
dials and passes it to Lou. Lou listens.
LOU
Hi Hector, sorry to wake you. It's
Lou. Ruben's in some trouble. He
has some hearing problems and...
Beat.
LOU (CONT'D)
Well I can put him on but he won't
be able to hear you.... okay.
Lou passes phone to Ruben. Ruben makes a face-

19.
RUBEN
S'up Hector. I can't hear anything
in my ears so this is dumb but I
know you'd be asking if I'm(mocking his voice)
-feeling unsteady? To which I'd say
mm, yeah I don't but then you'd say
"Ah Ruben did you know that
serenity is what we get when we
quit hoping for a better past?" And
I'd say "Ah thanks Hector, that's
helpful."
Lou shakes her head at Ruben.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Lou thinks I'm being rude or
somethin but I'm totally fine I
just had a fucking cigarette to
calm my nervesLou motions for the phone.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
My manager wants you back. Dude I'm
all good. Thanks for chattingRuben hands the phone back to Lou.
LOU
Hey... Yeah he's not hearing
anything right now... I don't know
how butShe listens for a beat.
LOU (CONT'D)
Okay... I will. Okay thanks Hector.
Lou hangs up. Passes phone back.
RUBEN
What's the deal? That's it?
LOU
He’s going to look into it and call
back.
RUBEN
He has nothing to say?

20.
LOU
No he‘s going to call back...
(Reuben still doesn’t get
it)
He’ll CALL BACK! CALLLL BACKKK.
RUBEN
What are you saying? Write it down.
Lou writes.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
He's gonna call back? That's it?
Fucking Hector. So what the fuck do
we do now? Let's just go LuluLOU
(overwhelmed)
Go where?
But Ruben doesn't hear.
I/E. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Lou enters the airstream. Sees Ruben in the drivers seat, in
a war with his seat belt. She watches him, scared, doesn’t
want him to drive. Her phone rings. She answers quickly.
Hi.

LOU

She listens.
LOU (CONT'D)
He’s right here...
Beat.
LOU (CONT'D)
Here. In the RV.
Beat.
LOU (CONT'D)
Not so good...
(listens, nods)
Oh really?... Okay... where is it?
Lou sits in her seat across from Ruben.

21.
LOU (CONT'D)
Okay wow. Um... that's not close.
It’ll take us some time cuz
we’re... not close.
Ruben is watching her.
RUBEN
That Hector?
Lou is frazzled, motions for him to shush.
LOU
Nothing... Yeah okay...
(beat)
I don’t know. Probably a couple
days or something?
(Beat)
Yeah we’ll leave right now.
(Beat)
No he'll drive(she looks at Ruben)
Cuz that's what's happening and he
always drivesWhat?

RUBEN

LOU
Okay thanks Hector. I really
appreciate it... yeah I’ll tell
him. Thanks. Bye.
What?

RUBEN

Lou pantomimes that Hector wants her to drive.
I/E. AIRSTREAM - DAY
Ruben drives on a northbound highway...
WE HEAR from his deaf POV, LOW VIBRATIONAL SOUNDS OF THE ROAD
intermixed with SOUNDS OF NATURE and the hearing world.
INT. AIRSTREAM - NIGHT
Ruben and Lou sleep in the airstream.

22.
I/E. AIRSTREAM - DAY
Ruben drives silently north on a cold, desolate highway...
INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY
Further into the wilderness...
EXT. AIRSTREAM - DAY
The airstream flies by into the endless, rolling, American
landscape...
I/E. JOE'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - DAY
Ruben turns up a dirt road, surrounded by forest - consumed
in anguish. He notices a sign, DEAF CHILD AREA.
RUBEN
You have service?
Lou shakes her head and peers forward, perhaps just as
apprehensive as Ruben.
Shit.

RUBEN (CONT'D)

They continue down a long dirt dead end road ending in a
large, funky, rambling house. Ruben brings the Airstream to a
stop in front of the house. He and Lou see A MAN, JOE, 70,
walking out of the house, holding his DOG.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
That him? Must be...
Lou keeps looking at him. Ruben kills the engine. Joe sets
his dog down.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben and Lou exit the trailer and walk toward Joe. He waives
to say hi.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
You must be Ruben?
RUBEN
Hey I'm Ruben. I don't do that
but...

23.
Joe smiles faintly, nods, points to the Airstream.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
That's quite a rig.
Joe motions "big".
RUBEN
Oh yeah. Right.
Joe turns to Lou and speaks normally.
JOE
Hello I'm Joe.
LOU
Hi. I'm Lou.
JOE
What was that? I read lips.
LOU
Oh. Um... My name's Lou.
Lou. Hi.
Hi.

JOE
LOU

Joe turns back to Ruben.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Shall we chat?
He makes the motion for talking to each other. Ruben stares
at him blankly.
JOE (CONT'D)
Lou could I ask you to look after
my beast for a bit while I borrow
Ruben?
LOU
(looking at dog)
Oh yeah. Sure.
Joe gives Lou a couple treats.
JOE
Give him a couple of these and
he'll love you forever. His names
Louie after the shortstop Luis
Aparicio. Pennant of '59.

24.

Oh right-

LOU

Joe raises his eyebrows.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Anyhow. Okay Ruben(nodding his head to come)
Follow me.
RUBEN
What about Lou?
(turning to Lou)
Lou you coming?
LOU
It's okay. Go. Really.
You sure?

RUBEN

LOU
Yeah. I'm good.
Joe sticks his thumbs up.
JOE
You stay here Louie. Stay.
Lou motions for Louie, holding out a treat. Joe begins
walking around the back of the house.
RUBEN
Okay. I'll be right back.
Lou nods. Watches Ruben walk away. Suddenly she's alone.
LOU
Louie. Come here.
EXT. BACK OF JOE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Joe walks in front of Ruben. JEREMY exits the back door of
the house. Joe signs to him.
JOE (ASL)
(to Jeremy)
Can you help me with that program
thing Jeremy?

25.
INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ruben sits in a small, shed like room while Joe watches
JEREMY fiddle with a computer. Jeremy turns to Joe and signs
to him.
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED)
You just have to open YOU CAPTION
and then specify one headset or two
in the preferences...
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Just do it please Jeremy.
Jeremy shakes his head.
What?

JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)

JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Come on it’s simple.
Joe looks up skeptically. Jeremey shrugs.
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
Put on the headset.
Joe puts it on over his hat. Jeremy rolls his eyes.
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
Say something.
Joe speaks in a gravely voice without much accent.
JOE
Okay, uh. Test.
The words pop up on a screen. Joe looks at the screen and
sees it’s working.
Oh good.

JOE (CONT'D)

Chris signs to him.
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Just press quit when you’re done.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Where do I do that?
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED)
You have to learn this stuff Joe.

26.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Can you run a chain saw Jeremy?
Jeremy stares at him and shakes his head.
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Whatever. Just leave it. I’ll come
back.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Thank you, shut the door please.
Jeremy shuts the door and leaves.
JOE (CONT'D)
(Looking at Ruben )
Okay. So... It works. Is this okay?
Ruben reads the screen.
Yes.

RUBEN

JOE
How are you?
RUBEN
Um. Can you hear me?
JOE
No but I’m going to read your lips.
I might miss some things but I’ll
try, okay? Try to speak clearlyOkay...

RUBEN

JOE
How are you Ruben?
RUBEN
Um... Okay.
Ruben exhales... Joe nods.
JOE
Are you hearing anything now?
Ruben shakes his head.
RUBEN
No, Nothing.
Joe nods.

27.
JOE
When did you lose your hearing?
RUBEN
Uh, a few days ago.
JOE
Oh. Really?
Joe glances at Ruben's leg shaking incessantly as if playing
an invisible kick drum.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
Lou sits on the step of the Airstream, petting Louie.
JOE (V.O.)
What sort of drugs?
INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ruben takes a deep, shaky breath.
RUBEN (V.O.)
What'd I take? Um, lots of things.
Heroin mainly.
JOE
Have you thought about using since
you lost your hearing?
RUBEN
... Uh... I mean, I don’t know. But
I mean, I’m fine. I haven’t taken
anything it’s just kind of fucked
up, sorry, uh, you know it’s messed
up right now with thisRuben gestures to his ears.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
So. I don’t know.
JOE
What don’t you know?
RUBEN
Uh- I just don’t know. Today's not
a good day. I'm not feeling steady
today. But I’m mainly here because
of my girlfriend you know?
(MORE)

28.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I just don’t want to mess
everything up for her.
JOE
How would you do that?
Ruben shrugs...
RUBEN
I don’t know, I just don’t want to.
JOE
And you think you might?
RUBEN
I don’t know. Probably not.
JOE
Okay... let’s talk about me.
(Pointing at himself)
I’m an alcoholic. Beer, you know?

Good.

RUBEN
(Dazed)

JOE
Good? No, not good Ruben.
RUBEN
No, I didn’t mean that. I’m sorry.
Sorry. Not goodJOE
I lost my hearing in the Vietnam
war when a bomb exploded near me.
Then I lost everything else, my
wife, my kid. Not because of being
deaf mind you. It was the beer
Ruben.
RUBEN
Okay. Sorry.
JOE
(stares at Ruben)
How long have you been clean?
RUBEN
Five years.
Five?

JOE

29.

Yes sir.

RUBEN

JOE
And you want some help right now?
RUBEN
(Fidgeting)
Uh... No. I just need to get uh...
I need to figure out this hearing
stuff and yeah. But-I don’t know.
This is a bad day. I’m not very
clear.
Ruben points to his head making an “I’m crazy gesture”
JOE
Okay. What about the addiction?
RUBEN
Um. I’m okay in that department.
Ruben puts his hands up as if to say “I don’t know” Joe
stares blankly.
JOE
You’re okay?
Yep.

RUBEN

JOE
So why are you here then Ruben?
Ruben stares for a beat, fishes for his phone, sees there's
no signal.
RUBEN
I should see if Lou is okay.
JOE
You worried about Lou?
RUBEN
I just don't know what she's doing.
JOE
How long have you two been
together?
RUBEN
Four years.
Joe nods, thinks.

30.
JOE
You play music right?
Joe mimics someone playing guitar. Ruben makes a face.
No.
No?

RUBEN
JOE

RUBEN
Not any more - until I get the(Pointing to ear)
... implant.
Implant?

JOE

Ruben looks at the screen... nods. Joe looks unimpressed.
RUBEN
Oh, sorry. Do you know much about
these implants you can get?
Implant?
JOE
I know, yes.
(IN SIGN)
Expensive.
(Rubbing two fingers
together)
RUBEN
Oh right. Yeah well.
Silence for a beat. Ruben is getting increasingly antsy.
JOE
So you should understand Ruben that
this is a Deaf community. Not just
my program but we're part of a
larger deaf community of working
Deaf adults and Deaf children from
all over. And my program and those
in it, benefit tremendously from
that Deaf community. We work with
them and they work with us. But
it’s very important if you want to
be here you understand that we’re
looking for a solution to this...
(pointing at his
forehead.)
Not this...
(pointing to his ears)
(MORE)

31.
JOE (CONT'D)
In this community being Deaf is not
thought of as a problem that needs
to be fixed. You understand?
RUBEN
Okay. Yeah okay cool.
Ruben checks his phone again. Joe thinks.
JOE
Why don't you invite Lou to come in
here?
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
Lou stands in the front of the house. She stares at the
nothingness, feeling very alone and terrified. her moment is
interrupted by the sound of Ruben's voice.
Lou!

RUBEN (O.C.)

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Lou walks toward the wooden stairs leading up to Joe's
office. Ruben is at the top of the stairs, holding the door
open.
RUBEN
This guy wants to talk to you.
Okay.

LOU

I/E JOE'S OFFICE - DAY
Lou and Ruben sit awkwardly.
JOE
I think it's important that you
stay here with us right now Ruben.
Learn some sign language? Find some
solid ground. What do you think?
RUBEN
Sounds great but we got no money
and-

32.
JOE
Well sometimes our church sponsors
deaf people in need of help. And
right now you fit the bill Ruben.
Ruben rubs his face.
RUBEN
Well honestly we're not church
people soJOE
Ruben can you please...?
Joe gestures for Ruben to not cover his face.
JOE (CONT'D)
I read lips, what did you say?
RUBEN
We're not religious. Either of us.
Very much not into religion no
offense.
JOE
Religion plays no part of this
Ruben. The church helps PEOPLE in
need, not just religious people.
The most important thing is that
you want to be here. If that’s in
place then I think we can find a
way.
JOE (CONT'D)
(turning to Lou)
Do you think Ruben needs help right
now Lou?
Lou stares, nods subtly.
JOE (CONT'D)
You understand that if Ruben was to
come here, he'd have to do it on
his own? Members live in one house
together with no contact to the
outside world - no phones. I’ve
found that in all cases that's the
way it works best. Can you help
Ruben Commit to that Lou?
Lou is shocked. Ruben reads the screen, agitated.

33.
RUBEN
We can just live in the RV. We have
a house.
JOE
I'm sorry to say that's not the way
this works Ruben.
RUBEN
Well that's a problem then.
Joe nods.
JOE
Is there anywhere you could be
during this time Lou?
Lou is like a deer in the headlights. Ruben stands.
RUBEN
That's that man.
Ruben sticks his hand out and shakes Joe's hand.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Cheers dude. Thanks for your time.
Joe stands.
JOE
It's nice to meet you Ruben.
Ruben nods and exits. Joe opens the door for Lou and follows
her down the stairs. She and Joe get to the bottom of the
stairs as Ruben is already around the corner. Lou turns to
Joe
LOU
So thanks. But can you tell us
anything about the surgery thing? I
think that's our main concern right
now.
JOE
Cochlear implant surgery?
LOU
I know it's expensive but I thought
maybe you could point us in the
right direction so we can get
everything going as fast as
possible.

34.
JOE
The surgery is not a fast process
Lou. It's brain surgery. It takes
months. So either way, Ruben will
not be hearing for some time. It's
important you understand this. He
needs real support now and focusing
on the surgery is actually not
going to help him. In fact it could
be very destructive.
Oh really?

LOU

Joe nods with certainty.
Ok well-

LOU (CONT'D)

JOE
This must not be so easy for you
either. It seems like maybe you
could use some support too.
Lou nods.
JOE (CONT'D)
Do you have anywhere you could go
find some help if Ruben came here?
Lou takes her hand off her stomach, trying to stay strong.
LOU
Well I'm fine but it's just, I
don't knowJOE
Sometimes people won't get help for
themselves until they know people
they love are going to be okay.
LOU
Okay. Yeah. ThanksJOE
So if you have anywhere at all to
land, consider doing that for
Ruben's sake.
Lou nods.
Okay.

LOU

35.
JOE
And Lou, don't hesitate on this.
Pull the bandaid off quick. It'll
hurt a lot less than the
alternative.
EXT. TOPS FIELD FAIR GROUNDS - NIGHT
The airstream is parked in a deserted fair grounds.
INT. AIRSTREAM - NIGHT
Lou scribbles in a journal in bed while Ruben sits at his
bedside workshop, fiddling loudly.
RUBEN
(a little too loud )
I think we should still go hit our
gig in Dayton Lulu. Seriously. I
can fucking watch you for cues. I
mean, it's not like we don't know
our shit. I can fucking make it
work until we have enough for the
surgery. We'll get there.
Ruben looks at Lou.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Really we're good to go.
He shuts the light off and gets in bed, puts his hand on
Lou's arm.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Come're little warthog.
LOU
Don't call me a warthog.
RUBEN
How's your tummy?
Lou puts her journal down and curls up in a ball next to
Ruben. He strokes her head.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Can I get you something? Tea?
Lou shakes her head no. She's on verge of tears.

36.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Man just need to deal with this
shit... I'll deal with it. It's
just fucking money. That's it.
As Ruben strokes Lou's head, the spark leaves his eyes and he
is overcome with an intense darkness.
INT. AIRSTREAM - EARLY MORNING
Lou wakes up, HEARS, a distant thumping sound. Ruben is not
in bed. Lou gets up and walks out of the bedroom into the
living room. She sees Ruben in the front of the airstream
obliterating a piece of equipment with his foot. Ruben looks
possessed. Lou walks toward him, sees him sweating all over.
Ruben!

LOU

Ruben doesn't hear, doesn't turn.
LOU (CONT'D)
RUUUBEN! STOP IT!
Lou sees Ruben has emptied a cabinet. Stuff is strewn on the
table and bench. Lou clutches her head in a state of
paralyzed anxiety as Ruben demolishes some equipment on the
floor.
EXT. AIRSTREAM - CONTINUOUS
She walks outside, paces outside of the airstream in a state
of deep thought and anxiety. She remembers Joe's words. She
takes out her cell phone and scrolls through her contacts.
She shivers in the cool of the morning. Her hands shake. She
can't bear to make this call... she can't... but she finally
presses a number and holds the phone up to her ear, her face
a contorted mass of anticipation. She talks to herself as it
rings. She shakes her head and is about to hang up, when a
SCRUFFY VOICE picks up. Lou's face goes white at the sound of
the voice.
LOU
Oh... ah... hello. Bonjour... is
this Richard?
Beat...
LOU (CONT'D)
Ah this is... Louise.

37.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben is apoplectic.
RUBEN
Why would you do that? Why would
you call him? How's that helping
us?
Lou writes furiously on a scrap of paper and slides it to
Ruben. He reads: IT'S THE ONLY PLACE FOR ME TO GO. AND YOU
NEED TO GO BACK TO THAT PLACE.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I'm not going back there. Why do
you need somewhere to go?
Lou writes. YOU NEED SUPPORT.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
This is support? You fucking leave?
You don't want to be here?
LOU
OF COURSE I DO!
RUBEN
I knew this was coming. Knew it.
This about the album or what?
Something your not telling me? You
get an offer?
Lou is perplexed. Mouths WHAT?"
Fuck it.
Ruben-

RUBEN (CONT'D)
LOU

RUBEN
I'm not a complete fucking moron
Lou ok?... please give me a little
creditLOU
What are you saying?!! What’s wrong
with you!!!
RUBEN
What?!!... I can’t hear you!!! DO
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM DEAF!!???
NO FUCKING HEARING!!

38.
Lou is teary eyed. Rubbing her sore stomach. At a loss...
Looking down at the table while Ruben rants... Lou writes on
on a piece of paper, passes it to him. He reads. YOU NEED
SUPPORT RIGHT NOW RUBEN.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I need a fucking gun in my mouth is
what I need. I NEED A FUCKING GUN
IN MY FUCKING MOUTH!
Lou can't take those words. Ruben looks around, lost and
angry. He looks back at Lou, sees her pain.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Look... I'm sorry Lulu I'm really
fucked up right now let me just
think for a second... I should just
come with you. I can figure shit
out thereLou stares at Ruben, crushed. Her phone rings. She answers,
while Ruben watches.
LOU
Hello... oh really? Okay.
RUBEN
Who's that?
Lou covers the phone while she listens.
LOU
Okay... okay I have to get ready...
no I'll call a cab. Yeah its fine.
okay. Thanks. Yeah thanks.
Lou pockets her phone.
RUBEN
What's going on?
LOU
I'm going to catch a plane and
you're going back to that place.
What?

RUBEN

Lou can't bear to repeat it.

39.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Ruben and Lou stand outside the airstream next to her guitar
and a big duffle bag etc. Ruben is crawling out of his skin.
RUBEN
Lou please don't do this. No way.
Lou tries to stay focused, clutching her stomach still in
heavy discomfort.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
How did this happen. Why are you
being cold like this?
This breaks Lou's heart. She shakes her head.
LOU
I'm not being cold.
Ruben stares at her as she sways in discomfort.
RUBEN
Just don't leave. I can figure this
out.
Ruben sees a taxi pulling up.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Oh mother fucker. This is fucked up
Lou. This is so fucked up.
The cab pulls up. Lou grabs her bag.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Hey. Slow down. Here.
He takes the bag.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Just slow down.
The cab driver gets out.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
(to the cab driver)
Just chill. We'll be a minute dude.
LOU
It's okay. Thank you.
The cab driver gets back in. Lou brings her guitar and other
stuff to the trunk. Ruben follows with her bag. Lou shuts the
trunk.

40.
Ruben looks at Lou, white as a ghost, trying to be brave.
RUBEN
This is so fucking wrong.
It's okay.

LOU

Lou holds up a finger, takes out a pad and scribbles: PROMISE
ME YOU ARE GOING BACK TO THAT PLACE FOR HELP. She flips the
pad over for Ruben to see... He reads and she takes it back,
writing again and pointing to the word for emphasis:
PROMISE!!
RUBEN
(Struggling with the
thought)
I promise ifLou cuts him off. She is in tears and rage. She slaps his
chest.
LOU
No. Promise Rubi!!
(Pointing at the page)
Promise!
Ruben nods... like a child suddenly.
LOU (CONT'D)
Or all of this is for shit Rubi.
RUBEN
I need more of a plan than this. I
need more, Lou... You gonna wait
for me?
From Ruben’s POV now as Lou nods her head, tears streaming...
LOU (SILENT)
What do you mean wait? Of course
I'm waiting.
Lou writes. YOU GOTTA GO BACK TO THAT PLACE. She stares at
him, takes Ruben's arm and turns it over and points to his
LULU tattoo.
LOU (CONT'D)
You hurt yourself and you hurt me.
I'll hurt myself too Rubi. I'll
hurt myself too! Go right back
there. Right now. Promise. Say it.
Lou mouths "promise".

41.

Jesus.
Say it.
Promise.
Good.

RUBEN
LOU
RUBEN
LOU

RUBEN
I’ll figure out all this shit Lou(pointing to ears)
I’ll figure it out okay? You know I
will. It’s not that bad.
The pain and sadness is breaking Ruben. Lou takes his face
and kisses it.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
When you get there I want you to
write me and tell me you’re safe?
You’re my fucking heart Lou. You’re
it for me. Okay?... Okay? I'm gonna
fix this. If it's shitty there,
just get your ass back here and
we'll figure it out. It's not that
hard.
LOU
I love you.
But Ruben doesn't hear.

Bye.

LOU (CONT'D)
(unable to bare it)

Lou turns and gets in the cab. Ruben shuts the door for her.
She looks forward and doesn't turn back. Ruben watches her
drive away. He stands alone in the parking lot. quietness. He
turns back and looks at the airstream, walks over, the terror
and loneliness of selfhood descending upon him as the
emotional muscle memory of loss takes over his gut. He sits
on the step of the airstream, broken and alone.
EXT. JOE’S HOUSE - DAY
Joe SEES RUBEN, sitting on the porch stairs, looking a mess,
smoking.

42.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - LATER
Joe takes his boots off and sets them next to a bunch of
other boots and sneakers. He gestures for Ruben to do the
same. He motions for Ruben to follow him up the stairs. They
walk up to the third floor.
INT. JOE'S HOUSE, RUBEN'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Joe reaches in and flicks the lights. Then he enters into a
room with two beds. He gestures toward the bed without sheets
and blankets on it. He puts his thumb up.
RUBEN
Is someone else in here?
Yes.

JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)

Joe stretches out his hand. Ruben is confused. Joe mimics
"someone starting a car". Ruben gets it.
RUBEN
(holding up keys)
You want them?
Joe shrugs while nodding as if to say “I might as well.”
Ruben hands the keys to Joe, stiffly. Then Joe signals for
Ruben's phone by putting his hand up to his face and talking
into his fingers.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
No, we're not doing that.
Joe is steadfast. Ruben looks at his phone. Hands it over.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - LATER
All of the adults in the house sit together in a circle...
Ruben fidgets...
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Everyone please say hello to Ruben.
Everyone simultaneously signs hello. Ruben nods back to the
rest of the room.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
Ruben has recently gone deaf, he
does not know ASL. He's an addict
and he will need support from
everyone.

43.
Joe looks around the room to make sure everyone gets it.
JOE (CONT'D)
He will also need a name.
Joe proceeds to write on a white board, “I JUST TOLD EVERYONE
THAT YOU'RE A DEAF ADDICT WHO DOES NOT KNOW SIGN LANGUAGE”...
Joe looks at Ruben then writes “YET”. Ruben’s face is pale
and expressionless. We can see he hasn’t slept in days. Joe
writes. YOU WILL ALSO BE GIVEN A DEAF NAME ONCE PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE. AND A JOB. Joe directs Ruben's gaze
to another white board with a graph and everyone's name on
it. He points to a name and then the corresponding job title.
Some of the titles are "kitchen crew" or things like
maintenance. He then writes Ruben's name on the board and
writes: LEARN HOW TO BE DEAF... LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE? Joe
looks at Ruben and raises his eyebrows. Joe looks at a large,
butch woman, JENN, 30’s tough, baggy jeans, hoodie. He signs
something to her. Jenn looks at Ruben and back at Joe...
shrugs- nods. Joe writes: EVERYONE HERE HAS A BUDDY. JENN
WILL BE WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES UNTIL YOU ARE STABLE AND
COMFORTABLE. Ruben glances at Jenn who nods back to him.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
(to Jenn)
Take the tablet for the first week
while Ruben gets his sea legs.
Spontaneously ONE WOMAN has an idea about a name for Ruben.
She holds her hand up to her face to indicate the largeness
of Ruben's eyes. The other members of the group agree, this
is a good name for Ruben. Joe agrees too. Ruben has been
named and he's the only one who doesn't know it.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM

- DAY

From Ruben's POV the meal is muffled, save for the low
frequency slamming of the table as raucous conversation
ensues around him.
We break out of his perspective into a surprisingly loud
dinner as an animated conversation progresses to a fever
pitch between DAN and a red faced Jenn. She signs lightning
fast... her signing becomes more and more crude as the moment
progresses. Joe slams the table adding something to the
conversation. Jenn shrugs as if to say “What’s the problem?”
Jenn looks at Ruben, knowing he's catching none of the
conversation. She types something into her tablet and big
bold words scroll across the screen: “DAN'S A PUSSY”. We stay
on Ruben’s face for a beat. He stares down at his food. He
looks around, bleary eyed at his alien, new home.

44.
INT. RUBEN’S ROOM - DAWN
Peter's snoring. Ruben's staring at him in the low morning
light but he hears nothing.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Pee silently hits the water in the toilet.
Ruben stares at his face in the mirror as he brushes his
teeth, silently.
EXT. JOE’S BARN - MORNING
Ruben light up a cigarette on the back porch. He looks up at
a broken eave on the low roof. Joe comes out and signals for
Ruben to come.
EXT. BACK OF JOE’S PICKUP - DAY
Ruben is packed in the back of a pickup, next to Jenn and a
handful of house-mates, signing to each other. Joe gets in
the driver seat and they drive down the driveway. Jenn types
in the tablet and it scrolls -FEEL BETTER? Ruben looks and
half nods. He motions for the tablet. He types IS THERE WIFI
ANYWHERE? Hands it back. She shakes her head, types - ONLY IN
JOE'S OFFICE. WHY? Ruben shakes his head, peers around as the
truck bumps along the dirt road.
EXT. FARM - DAY
The truck climbs a truck road up to the farm.
EXT. FARM - MOMENTS LATER
Everyone disembarks at a large garden. Joe shows them what to
do.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Ruben follows Joe through the school. They pass a group of
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS, signing to each other.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF/CLASSROOM - DAY
They approach a classroom. Joe sticks his hand in and flicks
the light switch.

45.
Ruben stands behind Joe as DIANE, AN ATTRACTIVE, KIND LOOKING
WOMAN opens the door opens to a classroom filled with very
rowdy, Deaf second graders. She signs hello to Ruben, who
does his best to sign back. Joe SPEAKS TO DIANE, GESTURES
SOMETHING ABOUT DRUMMING TO HER. She nods, Joe turns back to
Ruben.
What's up?

RUBEN

Joe pats Ruben hard on the back with a smirk, ushers him in
the classroom, then as Ruben looks at him, Joe shuts the door
between him and Ruben leaving him to fend for himself. Diane
beckons him in. The children gape at Ruben’s appearance as he
stands with Diane at the front of the room. Diane signs to
them. The only noise in the room is breathing and the
shuffling of hands.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Settle down.
(One boy, MICHAEL is
standing on his chair)
Michael sit in your chair.
Diane waits until everyone is settled...
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
This is Ruben. Everyone say hello.
The class does a simultaneous, signed hello.
DIANE (CONT'D)
Ruben is just learning ASL so he
will need your help and your
patience. Okay?
The kids sign “Okay”...
Okay.

DIANE (CONT'D)

Ruben looks at the kids.
Hi.

RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)

The kids giggle. Ruben wonders if he messed up. He looks at
Diane who smiles in encouragement. Ruben looks at Diane.
Ah...

RUBEN (CONT'D)

He’s at a loss... doesn’t know what he’s doing... the kids
are laughing at his confusion.

46.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
My name is Diane, what’s your name?
Ruben suddenly cannot remember anything from the ASL class.
The kids giggle and sign to one another... Diane spells her
name in sign for Ruben and then writes it on the board. She
points to Ruben... Diane hands him the chalk and gestures for
him to write his name... Ruben writes his name wildly graffiti style. His inspiration surprises Diane and the kids
go crazy for it.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
(To kids)
Relax please everyone.
Diane models an "R" in ASL to Ruben. Ruben tries to mimic and
Diane adjusts his hand. Ruben looks at the classroom of kids
raising their "R's" in the air.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben stands in the corner of the class now, watching Diane
walk a shy girl thru a spelling lesson.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
(handing her chalk)
Just your name Susanna.
The girl is too shy. Diane has to hold her hand while tracing
out the letters on the board.
LATER -Michael's sleeve is dark with saliva where he’s been
chewing it. He watches Ruben, wide eyed as he draws. The
chalk board is now covered with names written graffiti style
like Ruben's. Michael stands up and puts his hands in the
air. He’s the last one. Diane nods for him to come up.
Michael cannot contain his ADHD craziness. This may be the
most magical thing he has ever seen and Ruben, the most
magical person. He signs to Diane - a torrent of ideas.
Points to Ruben.
MICHAEL (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Can he make mine? I want the
letters dripping in blood and
poison!!!
Ruben looks at Diane.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Take a breath Michael.
MICHAEL (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Poison blood!!!!!

47.
Michael laughs devilishly and looks at Ruben.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Last chance Michael!
EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Ruben sits next to Jen and smokes. She taps her watch.
What?

RUBEN

INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Jenn and Ruben stand at a classroom door. She motions that
she'll meet him in an hour.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Normal chit-chat is replaced by the sound of rustling
clothing and the noise fingers/mouths make when they move.
Ruben sits amongst a small group of people. An ASL teacher
teaches an ASL class. Ruben feels claustrophobic, trapped in
a muffled hell.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
Jenn and Ruben walk together back to Joe's.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - EVENING
They approach an outdoor meal. Ruben taps Jen.
RUBEN
I'll be there in a minute.
Jenn seems unsure.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I'll be back.
Ruben turns and walks toward the back door, looks back to Jen
to see she's turned the corner, then he heads up the stairs
to Joe's office.

48.
INT. JOE'S OFFICE

- CONTINUOUS

Ruben, on Joe's computer, scrolls through his emails quickly
and panicked. He sees a message from Lou. He clicks on the email, heart pounding... scans quickly, stares at a selfie of
Lou huddled on a Parisian balcony... reads, HI RUBI, I AM
HERE. SO STRANGE - PLEASE LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE SAFE...
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE BEING SO BRAVE RIGHT NOW IS KEEPING ME
ALIVE. I MEAN IT! YOU MUST KEEP BEING BRAVE FOR ME WHEN YOU
DON'T WANT TO FOR YOURSELF. DON'T FORGET THIS PLEASE. I ADORE
U RUBI.
Ruben fights back emotion as he looks at the picture of
LOU...
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK
Ruben smokes in the fading light.
Fuck.

RUBEN

INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - NIGHT
We continue to hear THE WHISPER OF HANDS signing in unison as
we see solo shots of deaf addicts signing the lords prayer...
DEAF GROUP (ASL-SUBTITLED)
God grant me the serenity to Accept
the things I cannot change; Courage
to change the things I canINT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - NIGHT
Ruben, sitting next to Jenn, stands up awkwardly.
RUBEN
(Looking around room)
So yeah, I’m Ruben and I’m an
addict. I’ve been sober for about
six years. I’m sorry I don’t know
any(Mimics sign language)
Ruben looks at Joe as Joe translates to the room. The room
nods warmly at Ruben as they sign DEAF GROUP (ASL-SUBTITLED)
Hi Ruben...

49.
Ruben waves a quick “hi” back to the group, then glances
uneasily to Joe. Joe nods as Ruben shrugs, deflated.
EXT. JOE’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
Ruben tries to get a screw into the broken shutter on Joe’s
house. He focuses on his task. He looks up and sees Joe
looking at him. Joe shrugs as if to say “what are you doing?”
RUBEN
(Half salute)
Hey Joe.
Joe gestures again, “what are you doing?” Ruben points to the
obviously broken shutter. Joe stares at Ruben. He signals
without any room for translation that Ruben should follow
him. Ruben’s a bit confused by Joe’s demeanor.
INT. JOE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Joe sits across from Ruben.
JOE
What’s that all about Ruben?
Ruben reads the words on the screen.
RUBEN
What? The shutter?
Joe nods.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
(Smiling)
I was trying to fix your shutter.
JOE
Did I ask you to do that?
Ruben reads... suddenly worried that Joe might be crazy.
RUBEN
Ah... no butJOE
Maybe I like it that way.
RUBEN
(Laughing nervously)
Okay... Uh.
Ruben shakes his head, confused.

50.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I tried to fix your
broken shutter. That was bad.
Joe nods...
JOE
You don't need to fix anything
here.
Ruben is confused.
RUBEN
(Losing it a little)
You understand I was just trying to
help YOU OUT a little and be
useful. That's it.
Useful?

JOE

Ruben nods, exasperated, raises his eyebrows at Joe.
JOE (CONT'D)
(Animated)
Useful to who? Useful to me? Cause
I don’t need that Ruben. If I do,
I’ll ask you okay?
Ruben stays frozen. Shakes his head.
JOE (CONT'D)
I’ll be frank with you Ruben. You
are in a hard spot right now.
You’re in the middle of multiple
crises(Long look)
Sudden deafness, addiction, the
loss of your profession... And your
girlfriend too right?
Ruben tenses, shrugs.
JOE (CONT'D)
Ms. Barnett told me you were
wonderful with her kids yesterday.
She'll be starting a summer program
with some students next week and
she’d like you to help her. I think
that's a good idea. Does that
interest you?
Ruben shrugs in frustration...

51.
RUBEN
I don't know. I'm not fucking
drumming man. SoJOE
I can't see you, can you not cover
your face Ruben?
RUBEN
(scratching)
Sorry. I don't know if this will
work for me. Here.
JOE
... Well we’ll find out Ruben.
You’re here aren’t you? You’re here
of your own volition and you're
being fully supported.
Ruben looks away.
JOE (CONT'D)
How old when you started to support
yourself Ruben?
Ruben shrugs.
JOE (CONT'D)
(Nodding)
Young? Teenage?
Ruben stares... a “yes” by default.
JOE (CONT'D)
Do you think you know the
difference between working and
surviving, or living and surviving
Ruben?
Ruben looks mortified. He chews his lip as he reads the
words.
JOE (CONT'D)
I have an assignment for you okay?
Ready?
Ruben stares at the screen.
JOE (CONT'D)
You probably won’t like this at
first but from this point forward I
would like you to devote the first
part of the day to yourself
Ruben... Okay?

52.
RUBEN
(Very skeptical)
Uh huh.
JOE
I want you to take some time before
breakfast. You wake up early right?
RUBEN
(Nodding)
Pretty early.
JOE
I will have hot coffee waiting for
you by 5:30. Is that early enough?
RUBEN
I guess, I don’t know.
JOE
Okay five... And I will provide a
room for you.
A room?

RUBEN

JOE
And there is nothing that needs to
be accomplished in this room Ruben.
All I want you to do is sit.
Ruben stares at Joe, biting his lip.
JOE (CONT'D)
The only thing I ask is when, and
if you cannot just sit, you turn
yourself to the pen and paper, that
I will supply for you... And you(Pantomimes writing)
Write?
Ruben squints... very uncomfortable with the thought.
Uh.

RUBEN

JOE
It doesn’t matter what you write,
how you write, whether it’s spelled
correctly or if it’s a(pantomimes a big mess)
Mess... I don’t care. No one will
read it ok?

53.
Ruben stares at the screen.
JOE (CONT'D)
But I want you to keep writing
continuously, without stopping
until you feel like you can sit
again.
Joe stares at Ruben.
RUBEN
(Stressed)
Right... So, does it have to be
writing or?
JOE
Writing. Yes. Not drawing. Writing.
Ruben chuckles quietly, rubbing his closed eyes in disbelief.
JOE (CONT'D)
It wont be easy at first. And if at
any point it becomes too difficult
you should come find me. I will be
in my apartment doing the same
thing as you. Okay? I’ll be Writing
too...
RUBEN
(Under breath)
Fuck... Okay I guess.
Ruben stands.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
By the way she's still my
girlfriend.
Joe raises his eyebrows.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
You said I lost my girlfriend.
She's still my girlfriend.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - EVENING
Ruben smokes by himself. Jenn and Jeremy walk over. Jeremy
signs something to Ruben. Jenn types in the tablet: JOE WANTS
HIM TO DANCE FOR THE KIDS END OF SCHOOL THING. HE WANTS TO
KNOW YOU IF YOU’LL PLAY DRUMS WITH HIM. Ruben looks at
Jeremy. Jenn types. HE’S A DANCER. Ruben motions for the
tablet, types. DID JOE ASK YOU TO ASK ME? Jeremy reads and
looks at Ruben.

54.
RUBEN
Thought so.
He stares at Jeremy somewhat intensely.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Sorry bro. Not for me.
Jeremy is surprised at the rejection and the sudden mood
flair. He looks at Jenn, she’s also surprised.
JEREMY (ASL - SUBTITLED)
(To Jenn)
Cool. Okay.
Cool.

RUBEN

INT. JOE’S HOUSE - MORNING
Ruben walks into the kitchen and finds a donut sitting on a
plate and hot pot of coffee ready in the coffee maker.
INT. JOE’S STUDY - LATER
Carrying his coffee, his donut in his mouth, Ruben peers thru
an open door into a very empty room with a desk, a chair and
a couple nice, large windows... He looks at the room
suspiciously. He enters and closes the door. He sees a pen
and a notebook waiting for him. He puts his coffee down,
sits. He takes a sip as he looks out the window... He
scratches at his jeans... his hand and body restless... Now
he hits the pen against the desk over and over again... he
gets up, feeling like a true moron for being there at all...
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - GYM - DAY
Parents and students are seated. Ruben sits next to Jenn and
looks on as Jeremy turns a song on full volume, holds the
stereo to feel the rhythm and then dances. Ruben is impressed
by Jeremy's dance, feels ashamed for not drumming with him.
He looks over and sees Michael flopping around while Diane
tries to get him settled. Ruben signals to Diane that he can
take him outside. Diane gets Michael's attention and points
to Ruben. Ruben signals for him to follow him.

55.
EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, PLAYGROUND - DAY
Ruben and Michael exit the school. Michael runs ahead to the
slide. Ruben walks up to him at the top of the slide, signals
to Michael the symbol for "phone".
RUBEN
You have a phone dude?
Michael nods, surprised to be useful. He takes out his phone.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Is it locked?
Michael doesn't understand. Ruben gestures for the phone.
It's locked. He shows it Michael. Michael unlocks it. Ruben
sits on the bottom of the slide and quickly opens up a web
page, loads his e-mail, nothing from Lou. He erases the web
page, lowers the phone. He turns around to see Michael's face
looking down at him from the top. Ruben turns around, sits on
the ground and begins tapping on the metal... We HEAR from
his POV... Michael smiles up at him feeling the vibrations...
Ruben takes out his other hand and starts tapping a simple
beat. Michael’s eyes go way wide and he laughs... Ruben keeps
the beat up but begins to increase the speed and complexity
of it... Michael is in heaven as he feels the beat vibrating
inside of his head. Ruben watches him as he drums on the
slide... Michael closes his eyes in a rare moment of calm...
The metallic beat continues, echoing out over the school
campus... as...
BEGIN MONTAGE:
EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Ruben, Diane and the children walk through the fields around
the school. We see Ruben is signing now with the Deaf
children. The children chase Ruben joyfully until he lets
himself be tackled and wrestled to the ground.
INT. JOE'S HOUSE, STUDY - MORNING
Vibrations in the coffee as Ruben writes feverishly...
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Ruben plays an ASL game with a kid in the class. He's
learning.

56.
EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
Ruben and Diane take the children hiking.
I/E TRUCK, JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
Ruben sits in the back of the truck with other addict adults
from the community... Ruben looks out at forest passing him
by... his eyes have calmed somehow and the silence is no
longer oppressive to him...
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY
Ruben sits around the dinner table, now comfortable in ASL.
He laughs and signs and eats.
EXT. PORCH - LATER
At the table, Ruben draws a picture of a sexy, nude, woman...
Jenn is watching... he gets to the crotch area and looks at
Jenn.
JENN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
What? She’s hot.
Ruben mimics like he’s drawing on the crotch.
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
What are we talking?
|JENN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
(Nodding)
Bush? Yeah bush, definitely.
Ruben nods in an inspired “Oh, okay” manner. Jenn nods. Ruben
goes back to the drawing and starts in on the bush. Jenn taps
his shoulder.
JENN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Little bit. Not crazy.
Ruben grins, nodding in approval.
Name?

RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)

Jenn suddenly gets very serious... Thinks... Ruben looks at
her... “No”, she shakes her head rigidly. Ruben looks for a
beat more at Jenn’s face... some untold story... untold love.

57.
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
Where do you want it?
Jenn points to the back of her shoulder.
INT. JOE’S STUDY - MORNING
Ruben closes the door of the writing room, sets his coffee
down on the table... sits in the chair. He looks at his
notebook but he doesn’t open it. He picks up his coffee and
takes a sip. He looks out of the window... and he sits...
Ruben just sits...
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, GYM - DAY
In the middle of the wooden floor of the gym, Ruben finishes
assembling his drum kit. He walks to the stool, sits, picks
up his sticks. He hits the bass drum once. It's an odd
feeling to be behind the kit again. He can only feel the
vibration of the sound. Then he launches into a funk beat
that he doesn't hear.
Portraits of children, feeling the sounds through colored
balloons. Diane too.
Now from behind Ruben we see all the kids holding their
balloons. And we hear the full sound of Ruben's drums.
Afterwards he shows Michael the kit.
INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - NIGHT
Close up on Jenn’s face. A moment of rawness.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Everyone should congratulate Jenn
on reaching the end of her stay at
the house. Is it frightening to
think of leaving?
Jenn shrugs, trying to maintain her tough composure.
JOE (CONT'D)
Where will you stay?
Jenn gulps...
JENN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Probably land with my parents I
guess...

58.
Jenn’s face is blotchy with fear... she speaks to try to get
out of the emotion.
JENN (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
A middle aged deaf, dyke, addict,
living with her parents. That’s
pretty hot.
Ruben can’t follow what’s being said but he sees Jenn’s face
and he gets it.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Do you think that environment at
your parents is going to be
conducive to your stability and
happiness Jenn?
Jenn shrugs... she is overwhelmed with fear... she tries to
hold it together...
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE PORCH - DAY
Ruben reads on the porch. Joe approaches.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
How are you doing Ruben?
Ruben nods...
Okay.

RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)

Joe sits.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
I know you and Jenn are close. Can
be tough when it's time for folks
to move on.
Joe looks at Ruben. Ruben scratches his head anxiously.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
You have become important to many
people around here Ruben.
Ruben shrugs.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
How are you feeling?
RUBEN
(Fidgeting)
Um... Okay.

59.
Joe studies him...
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
So Ruben. I'd like to offer you a
way to continue on here with us...
Joe nods at Ruben trying to gauge Ruben’s feeling... Ruben
nods conservatively.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
I imagine that you’re probably
beginning to think about the future
a little. Right?
Ruben repeats the sign for future.
Future?

RUBEN

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Yes future.
Ruben shrugs, looking increasingly uncomfortable... He
continues to read from the computer screen.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
I do think there’s a way that you
could stay and work here if you’d
like to. Maybe helping me
with my program, maybe working at
the school with the kids... Maybe
both.
Ruben nods and Joe nods back with a confident smile.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
Anyway, you think about it okay?
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Okay thank you...
Joe gives him a slap on the knee before walking away. Ruben
lights a cigarette and as he sits, his anxiety builds... an
old familiar rumbling.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben jogs up the stairs of to Joe's office.

60.
INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ruben clicks on a video link someone shared on their bands
website... written comments in French. Suddenly he’s watching
Lou with her gear, performing wildly on a French stage,
alone... we watch Ruben’s face as he watches Lou's face,
without him... his eyes locked in torment...
INT. AIRSTREAM - DUSK
Ruben rounds a group of trees to where he parked his
airstream. He makes sure no one is looking, opens a side
compartment, finds a hidden key and enters the Airstream. He
looks around at his old life. The posters of their band. Sees
the mess he made before saying goodbye to Lou. Ruben scours
thru drawers of Lou’s clothes... He finds a piece of Lou’s
clothing and holds it to his face, breathing her in. He sits
in Lou's seat and holds her sweater.
INT. AIRSTREAM - LATER
With intensity Ruben begins to rip the cords out of the back
of the racks full of equipment.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben sets up his drum kit. He sits behind it, hits it a
couple times before launching into a furious blast beat. The
sounds echo through the woods around him.
INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY
Ruben grabs a box from the back of the Airstream as Jenn
gazes at the wall of pictures. She sees a very dated picture
of a woman(20's), warm and strong and a boy (Ruben at 10)
standing outside the same airstream. The woman stands behind
the boy with her hands on the boys shoulders, wearing a proud
smile. Jenn points at the woman in the picture.
Mom?
Mom?

JENN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
RUBEN

Jenn nods.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Yeah, yeah. Mom.

61.
Jenn moves her focus down the wall of pictures. Her eyes get
wide as she stares at a picture of Lou. She flashes Ruben,
who's busy working, a look of “Holy shit, is she yours?”.
Ruben’s mind is elsewhere but he manages a half hearted nod
and a shrug. Ruben points to a pile of packed boxes and looks
at Jenn for her reaction. Jenn looks overwhelmed. She
gestures animatedly, with horror, as if to say “What, all of
them?”. Ruben nods confidently and Jenn shakes her head with
displeasure. We hear her heavy deaf accent.
Fuck that.

JENN

Jenn finishes punching a last few letters into the tablet
before holding it out, aggressively, for Ruben to see. I NEED
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT’S IN THE PACKAGES AND WHY YOU ARE
SENDING THEM? NO BULL-SHIT. Ruben doesn’t hesitate. He points
at the picture of Lou... He looks back at Jenn signaling
“money” with his fingers. He points back to Lou’s picture meaning, “For her”. Jenn nods slowly, not convinced. Ruben
signals again “Money” and points to himself and then to Jenn.
Jenn waves off Ruben’s offer of money.
EXT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben and Jenn load the large mixer into the van. He turns to
Jenn, looks at the tattoo on her shoulder of the picture he
drew for her. He taps the tattoo to get Jenn’s attention...
he gestures...
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
I should go with you Jenn and help
with this beast.
Jenn shakes her head...
JENN
Don't sweat it. I got this.
Ruben sees Jenn is hurting.
You okay?

RUBEN

JENN
Yeah I'm fine.
RUBEN (ASL - SIGNED)
(Nodding adamantly)
Seriously I should go with you.
Jenn makes a gesture “suck my dick”.

62.

You sure?

RUBEN (CONT'D)

Jenn gets in the van and starts it up. Ruben holds his hand
up to her. She rolls down the window.
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
Remember just cash no checks.
Jenn makes a face and pulls forward.
You cool?

RUBEN (CONT'D)

Jenn nods in annoyance.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - CLASSROOM - DAY
End of summer performance. Diane and Ruben and the children
sit in a circle with white plastic buckets in front of them.
Ruben takes a bag of sticks...
The bag is passed around and the children hold their sticks
in their hands. Even Michael manages to be patient. When
everyone has the sticks, Ruben signals to Michael to lead the
rhythm. Michael begins to hit his bucket using a simple
rhythm. The other kids join in unison. The beat progresses.
Diane watches Ruben's focus with the kids. The simple beat
echoes loudly from all of the buckets... Ruben looks at
Michael who is eyeing him intently. He nods to him and
Michael speeds up, double timing the beat, too focused to
smile. Ruben looks on proudly. At the end the parents clap.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - GYM/THEATER - DAY
Everyone’s gone except for Michael, who plays a video game
while Ruben and Diane clean up... Diane touches Ruben's
shoulder as he stacks chairs...
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
You can go. It's okay. Michael's
father is always late.
RUBEN
It's okay. I'll stay.
EXT. DEAF COMMUNITY - DUSK
Ruben and Diane exit the school and walk down a campus road
toward the parking area. Diane glances at Ruben as they walk.

63.
There is an implied intimacy to being outside together
without the children. They come to Diane's car. Diane stops.
Ruben stops too. Diane looks at him perhaps a bit more
intently than before. Ruben, caught for a moment in her eyes,
does not allow room for the moment to extend. He salutes her.
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Okay good night.
Diane is taken off guard.
DIANE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Would you like a ride?
Ruben shakes his head.
RUBEN
No. I'll walk. Goodnight.
Ruben turns unceremoniously and walks away. Diane grins
slightly, absorbing Ruben’s departure. She watches him walk
away for a moment, then turns the other direction.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ruben flicks the light switch on Jenn’s door... finally he
opens the door but the room is empty.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ruben sets the table. Jeremy walks by.
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Have you seen Jenn?
JEREMY
Not since breakfast.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - LATER
Joe is pulling out as Ruben runs toward the truck. He rolls
down the window.
RUBEN (ASL - SUBTITLED)
She mentioned something about going
into town... I should come with you
Joe.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Did she say anything else?

64.
Ruben shakes his head.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
I'll see you later.
Joe pulls away.
EXT. JOE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ruben smokes on the porch.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
Early morning...
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - MORNING
Ruben walks down the hall toward Jenn’s room. He opens the
door. The room is still empty.
INT. JOE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben sees no donut or coffee waiting. Louie the dog perks up
at the sound of Joe's truck. Ruben sees him pulling up in
front of the house.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - DAY
The group sits in a circle. Joe looks at everyone...
exhausted.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
Jenn did overdosed last night.
Luckily the police found her in
time. She is in stable condition at
the hospital now and will go from
there to rehab again I think...
Joe rubs his face... he’s clearly very upset.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
I must say I didn’t see this
coming. She apparently had a large
sum of cash on her. I am baffled as
to how she had access to cash
but...
Ruben looks down. Joe notices.

65.
EXT. FARM - DAY
Ruben works extra hard in the farm.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben tries Joe's office door. It's locked.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - DAY
Ruben enters Joe’s apartment door and enters his section of
the house. He quietly closes the door behind him, goes up the
stairs - looks around at Joe’s very neat and orderly room.
His eyes are caught by a picture on Joe's refrigerator of Joe
as a young man with his wife and child, now long gone...
Ruben rifles through drawers, finds a small inner drawer with
keys... he rustles through the keys until he comes to his
Airstream keys.
INT. JOE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben sits at the computer. He feverishly pulls up Prince
Audiology, looks around nervously then dials the number on
the captioned telephone. He waits until he sees words pop up
on the screen.
RUBEN
Hello, can you hear me?
The words, YES I CAN HEAR YOU. CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME YOUR
NAME?
RUBEN (CONT'D)
It's Stone. Ruben Stone. R-U-B-E-N
Stone, S-T-O-N-E. I'm confirming an
appointment.
Ruben waits.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Yes I can hold.
INT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, GYM - DAY
Ruben and Diane and all the children gather around a grand
piano in the gym and put their hands on it. A PIANIST begins
playing a piece of music and the children listen to the music
through their hands.

66.
Ruben looks at the children but his mind is elsewhere. The
sweet sounds of the piano merge with dark vibrations of his
unrest.
INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY
Ruben sits in Lou's seat. For a moment he appears to be alone
until he looks over at a MAN AND HIS GROWN SON, as they
inspect the Airstream.
INT. AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER
The man writes a number down and slides it to Ruben. Ruben
looks at the paper and grins...
RUBEN
(Waving hand all around)
Man, you know exactly what I have
here right? I mean really. I don’t
need to sell this. I REALLY don’t.
I’d be happy to keep it dude.
Ruben looks dead into the mans eyes. The man shrugs stiffly.
MAN
I understand. So ListenThe man writes a number and slides a piece of paper across
the table to Ruben.
MAN (CONT'D)
This is it. That’s all I’m doing
soRuben gazes at the piece of paper. Looks up at the guy.
RUBEN
... So I have a proposition for
you. Honestly it’s the only way I’d
even consider(Gesturing to the paper)
This. But here’s the deal though...
RUBEN (CONT'D)
You and I both know that this is
worth a hell of a lot more than
what you’re offering... it's fully
wired as a recording studio. You
know how much, just that is worth?
The man begins to protest-

67.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Hey, Common. Just don’t. I know the
fair price for this and I know you
do too and this,
(Pointing to his number)
-is a fucking joke.
The man shrugs coldly.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
But I have an idea. What if I were
to give it to you at this price?
The man looks up...
RUBEN (CONT'D)
With the condition that I have the
option to buy it back from you for
ten percent more than you’re paying
me within like... a couple months
from now.
The man looks at Ruben like he’s nuts. From Ruben's POV...
Why?

MAN (SILENCE W/T SUBTITLES)

RUBEN
But it’s got to remain in it’s
current condition, everything in
place
(gesturing)
The man considers as Ruben waits. The son gives a thumbs up.
Ruben wants to rip his throat out.
MAN
I can give you a monthRuben signals to the guy to write it down. He does. Ruben
looks at it.
RUBEN
Five weeks. Pay pal's ideal.
EXT. AIRSTREAM - DAY
Ruben watches as the man drives away with his Airstream
followed by the son in his SUV.

68.
INT. JOE’S HOUSE - MORNING
Close up on Ruben writing a note. JOE, EVERYTHING IS OKAY.
I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW. -R
Ruben leaves the note next to the donut that's waiting for
him... the pot of coffee... but instead of eating it he turns
and exits the house leaving the donut and coffee behind.
INT. OPERATION ROOM, HOSPITAL - DAY
Sound of A BUZZING NOISE... as the monitor in the operating
room shows a drill working it’s way through the hardest bone
in Ruben's scull toward his ear canal. A wide shot reveals a
SURGEON and a nurse, leaning over Ruben, only recognizable by
his exposed, tattooed hand.
INT. RECOVERY ROOM, HOSPITAL - LATER
Ruben lies in a bed. There are bandages over two shaved spots
on his head where he had the surgery. A doctor writes on a
white board: EVERYTHING WENT WELL RUBEN. YOUR EAR CANAL HAS
BEEN BYPASSED SO YOU WILL EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTE SILENCE DURING
THIS TIME. YOU WILL NEED TO COME BACK HERE IN FOUR WEEKS FOR
ACTIVATION.
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY

Ruben, wearing a beanie, walks toward Joe's.
INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ruben, wearing the hat, sticks his hand inside Joe's study
and flicks the light switch. Joe opens the door.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED)
You're back.
Ruben shrugs. Joe stares at him.
JOE (CONT'D)
Come on in.
Ruben enters, sits. Joe sits.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
(motioning at computer)
You want this on?
Ruben shrugs.

69.
JOE (CONT'D)
I'll turn it on but you don't
really need it anymore do you?
Joe turns on computer. Then turns to Ruben.
JOE (ASL - SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
What's on your mind?
Ruben is squirmy.
RUBEN
That's a good choice of words.
JOE
Why's that.
RUBEN
I did the deed.
The deed?

JOE

Ruben lifts his hat a little.
Surgery.

RUBEN

Joe disguises shock, raises his eyebrows, taking it in.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Ok... Does it hurt?
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
Not too bad.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Hmm. And when do they get
activated?
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
3 or 4 weeks.
Joe looks stiffly at Ruben for a long beat... Ruben smiles
uncomfortable... He looks around the room.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
(Rubbing hands together)
So yeah...
Ruben looks back at Joe who’s face is unchanged.

70.
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
(Shrugging)
What’s up?
JOE
(ASL - SPOKEN)
How’d you find the money?
RUBEN
Sold my RV. And my shit.
Joe nods.
Okay-

JOE

Ruben looks suddenly shaky, out of sorts.
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
Look, I really don’t wanna explain
myself right now Joe? I’m sorry but
no... now’s the time for
fucking action and saving my
fucking life so that’s what I’m
doing. Okay? It’s time... Nobody
else is saving my life right?
(Pointing to ears)
I mean this isn’t a joke. I know
you think this is just another fix
and now I’m fucked, blah, blah...
and I really appreciate everything
you’ve done for me man but... I had
a fucking life before I got here
Joe and I'm losing it...
Joe looks on at Ruben stoically...
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
I mean if I just sit here and
diddle around, what will I have?
Nothing.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
You know Ruben, I understand how
you feel. I doRUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
What does it matter? All this shit,
it just passes. Nobody cares if I
vanish man. Seriously. Who cares?
It’s all gonna just keep moving...
and...
(Tearing up)
That’s what life does.
(MORE)

71.
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
It fucking passes. It doesn’t
fucking wait... So|JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
When you say passes do you mean
your girlfriend? What?
|RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
Yes my fucking girlfriend. All of
it... everything! I can’t just sit
here and waste away. So...
Ruben fidgets. Joe watches calmly.
JOE ((ASL - SPOKEN)
I wonder Ruben, during these
mornings when you have been sitting
in my study(signs sitting)
Sitting. I wonder if you've had any
moments of stillness?
Ruben stares at the words on the screen.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Because you're right Ruben the
world does keep moving and it can
be a damn cruel place... But for
me, that place of stillness that
comes when I'm not clamoring, or
running or desperately clutching...
the moments where this crappy
mundane world suddenly becomes
radiant and magnificent, and all
fear is gone... for me, THAT PLACE
is the kingdom of God... not a
church or heaven or any particular
religion... THAT PLACE, inside
you... that is where god lives
Ruben...
Ruben looks away from the screen to Joe who is staring deep
in his eyes.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
And that place will never abandon
you, never pass you by. When all is
lost, it'll still be there for you
I assure you.
Ruben nods as his foot shakes up and down.

72.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
But I see you have made your
choice, right?
Ruben stares at the words on the screen. He nods, not able to
look at Joe.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
And I sincerely hope it brings you
happinessRuben nods... Beat...
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
Look, ah... I was wondering Joe...
I mean I don't know if it's
possible but I need to come up with
some money to buy back my RV and
um, I can totally pay it back I
just have a bit of a time issue
right nowJoe stares at Ruben.
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
I’m sorry to ask but...
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Ruben? I don't understand the
situation you've put yourself in
but from my seat you look and sound
like an addictRuben laughs and shakes his head.
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
That’s fine Joe. My situations
fine. My girlfriends got a rich
daddy who can totally front me so
I’ll just go ask him. Thought I
might skip that humiliating fucking
road, but hey at this point, the
hell with pride right? No, fuck it.
Sorry to ask but. Seriously. This
is nothing. You can’t imagine how
fucking nothing this is. I’m good
man.
Joe stares.
Okay.

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)

73.

Okay.

RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)

Joe nods as Ruben.
JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Ruben, as you know everyone here
shares in the belief that being
deaf is not a handicap. Not
something to fix. That’s pretty
important around here. All of these
kids, all of us need to be reminded
of it every day.
Ruben shifts in agitation...
RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
I understandJOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
And my house is a house built on
that belief and built on trust. And
when that trust is violated, things
happen like what happened to Jenn.
Right?
Ruben stares at Joe. Knows he knows.
JOE (CONT'D)
And I can’t have that. There are
too many others to consider...
Ruben feels a pit in his stomach. He looks at Joe with
feigned resilience.
Okay.

RUBEN

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
So, in your current state, at this
time, I don't see a person who can
be here.
Beat.
JOE (CONT'D)
And for my part I will not support
the choices you're making
financially or otherwise. So I'm
going to have to ask you to pack
your stuff today and find another
place to be Ruben.
Ruben stares at Joe...

74.
Joe stares back...
Cool.

RUBEN

Ruben gets up and leaves. Joe sits and reaches for his mug.
His hands shake and for one small moment we see the depth of
his burden and his pain at having lost one of his own.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
Ruben sits with his bag at a bus/train stop.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
Ruben watches closed captioned TV in a dark motel room eating
Chinese food out of a container.
INT. MOTEL, BATHROOM - DAY
Ruben unwraps his bandages, looks at his stitched scars.
He takes out electric clippers and shaves his head.
EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
Ruben walks across the parking lot with groceries. He watches
people talking to each other and laughing.
EXT. MOTEL - DUSK
Ruben does laundry.
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
Ruben fights to make it through the loneliness and the
gnawing desire to get high. He thinks of Lou.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
An Audiologist bends over Ruben and affixes a contraption to
his ear with a module that connects magnetically to something
now embedded underneath his skin. Ruben watches her lips move
noiselessly.
AUDIOLOGIST
Are you ready?

75.
Ruben nods... despite not hearing her.
Okay.

AUDIOLOGIST (CONT'D)

We HEAR ABSOLUTE SILENCE until...
The doctor flips a switch and suddenly sound enters Ruben’s
head... WE HEAR THE NOISE AS RUBEN DOES...
AUDIOLOGIST (CONT'D)
Can you hear me?
Ruben hears sound for the first time in months. But the sound
is strange. Not at all like natural sound. This is digital
and harsh sound. Ruben nods... trying to keep from crying. He
touches the device around his ear as if maybe the sound will
suddenly clear and turn into what he remembers...
AUDIOLOGIST (CONT'D)
How does it sound?
RUBEN
Um... it’s weird.
Ruben does not like the sound of his own voice. It is loud
and tinny... he tries to suppress his panic... the doctor
adjust the frequency. The sound changes but it's still
oppressive.
AUDIOLOGIST
How's that?
Ruben is shell shocked.
RUBEN
Ah... sounds bad.
AUDIOLOGIST
As I’m sure you know Ruben, this is
not sound like you remember. What
you’re hearing is actually a
digital signal being received by a
metal device in your head and it’s
sort of tricking your brain into
thinking that you are actually
hearing. But in reality your ears
aren’t working still. It’s the
implant inside your head that is
creating the sensation of sound.
That’s the sound you’re hearing...
Okay.

RUBEN

76.
AUDIOLOGIST
You gotta give it some time okay? I
would suggest you take it easy in
these next weeks...
Ruben stares into the void as the metallic sounds fill his
head.
EXT. SKY - EARLY MORNING
A jet plane enters the frame. The sound builds to a deafening
roar.
EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY
The early morning traffic of Paris like a rocket in Ruben's
ears... as he pulls his bag through the city... a scooter
goes by, a siren... French school children yapping like
geese...
EXT. RICHARD’S APARTMENT - DAY
Ruben approaches an ornate Parisian apartment building. He
rings a buzzer and waits. An old voice comes through a
speaker like a chain saw.
Bonjour?

RICHARD (O.C.)

RUBEN
Ah hello. Is ah... is Lou here?
RICHARD (O.C.)
(heavy accent)
Who is this?
Ruben hesitates.
RUBEN
Ruben. It’s Ruben.
A moment - then the door buzzes. Ruben enters -looks around
at the sophisticated opulence. He opens the door of an
antique elevator, wincing at the metallic clatter. He rises.
INT. RICHARD’S APARTMENT - DAY
RICHARD (60, French, handsome) opens the door of a sprawling,
magnificent Parisian apartment. He looks Ruben over...

77.
RUBEN
Hey. I'm Ruben.
RICHARD
Yes hello. Come in.
Richard turns and walks into the apartment leaving Ruben with
no choice but to follow, past a vast array of eclectic and
sophisticated stuff. Much of the items relate to Richard as a
young singer and his legendary career in music. Richard
speaks in French to a couple of WORKERS preparing for a
party. Richard disappears into the kitchen.
RICHARD (O.S) (CONT'D)
You are hungry Ruben?
Ruben follows behind unsure if Richard said anything. Richard
is making food when Ruben enters the kitchen.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
You are hearing now?
Richard gestures to Ruben.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
You are hearing?
RUBEN
Um... yeah, I got an operation.
Ruben removes his hat and reveals the hearing devices above
his ears. He looks sheepish with his short hair and awkward
ear fixtures.
RICHARD
Ah wow. This is very good no?
Louise told me your wish for this.
(Beat)
And so now you will go back to your
drums?
RUBEN
I need to get some things settled
first but yeah.
RICHARD
Settled like what?
RUBEN
Oh just back into it and you know,
financial stuff, just have to
figure it all outRichard gives Ruben a look-

78.
RICHARD
Is see. Louise is not here. Does
she know you are coming? She didn’t
mention.
No-

RUBEN

RICHARD
Well this will be a big surprise.
She has been very busy lately as
I'm sure you have heard. We are
preparing a party as you see. So
she will most certainly be home for
this. They think I am to die so we
have a birthday party but really it
is, as I call it a death party.
RUBEN
Wow. Okay. Then happy birthday or
whateverRICHARD
It was two months past. As I say
not about birth.
Ruben stares.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
But let me tell you it is wonderful
to see Louise playing music again.
Richard stares at Ruben.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
It is of her blood as you say.
RUBEN
Right. Yeah.
Ruben fidgets uncomfortably.
RICHARD
I will make you some eggs.
RUBEN
No it's okay.
RICHARD
Yes, you need some eggs.

79.
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Ruben and Richard sit at the table, the bells of Paris in the
background.
RICHARD
Where did you grow up Ruben?
RUBEN
Just uh, kind of everywhere...
Virginia, Georgia, Houston,
ArizonaRICHARD
Why so many places?
RUBEN
My mother was a nurse in the
military so just had to move a lotRICHARD
And your father too?
RUBEN
No. I mean, I don’t know.
RICHARD
I see. But this is of your blood
then isn't it, this traveling?
I guess.

RUBEN

Ruben looks away and jerks his knee up and down. Richard
observes him...
RICHARD
And now is it back on the road for
you?
RUBEN
Um... yeah, sure.
Ruben looks away - shifts uneasily. Richard tears off a piece
of bread and uses it to eat his egg.
RICHARD
I must be honest, I have not always
had such good feeling for you these
years Ruben.
Richard chews...

80.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
I confide it is as one has stolen
something precious. You understand?
Um-

RUBEN

RICHARD
And I admit I am not understanding
this music of yours... so all the
time I am thinking what is this?
Okay.

RUBEN

RICHARD
But Ruben I know that it was not
you who took Louise from me.
Richard chews with ferocity.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Her mother did this... You
understand?
Ruben nods. Richard's hand trembles as he holds the bread...
Ruben watches it.
Yes?

RICHARD (CONT'D)

RUBEN
Yes. I know about that.
RICHARD
She took Louise when she left me
and she took her again when she
killed herself.
Richard stares at Ruben.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Louise should have come back here
then but she was hating me so what
could I do?
(long sigh)
But you... you gave her a place to
go at this time.
Richard is suddenly, surprisingly emotional-

81.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
This is very good. I did not like
you so much then but now I thank
you. I want to say you this okay?
Ruben stares.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
But anyhow, I think you will be
happy to see her doing so well.
That is what is important right?
Richard chews on another piece of bread.
No?
Of course.
Ok good.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
RUBEN
RICHARD

INT. LOU'S BEDROOM - DAY
Ruben closes the door of a large bedroom. This is Lou’s room.
Stuff is piled everywhere in typical Lou fashion. Some
musical equipment. Books. Next to Lou’s bed is a photo of
Ruben in front of the Airstream. Ruben picks up a pile of
photos from a stack of stuff in the corner of the room. He
looks through a series of shots of Lou as a young girl with
her very beautiful, once was actress, mother - presumably
taken by Richard... on a beach... her mother, topless,
flirting with the camera. Lou, withdrawn, even then.
Underneath these photos is a stack of magazines highlighting
Lou’s mother at the height of her stardom in various, highly
sexual poses - some with a much younger, cooler Richard.
Ruben closes the shutters over Lou’s bed muffling the sound
of the street below. He climbs into bed.
INT. LOU'S BEDROOM - EVENING
From Ruben’s POV, he wakes in a daze to the SOUND of shutters
opening, letting the last blue light of the day into the
room. Ruben turns over... sees Lou. Ruben can barely
recognize her. She looks vibrant and strong.
Whoa.

RUBEN

Lou turns toward him, grins warmly; but uncomfortably; taking
in all of her lost friend.

82.
LOU
Hi. Can you hear me?
Ruben sits up, feedback slamming his ears as she latches the
shudders.
RUBEN
Yeah. Loud and clear...
Look at you Lulu.
She turns toward him.
What?

LOU

RUBEN
You look different.
Ruben looks at her arm.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
No scratching.
Oh yeah-

LOU

RUBEN
That's good...
Ruben gets up and give Lou a hug, his ears buzzing with the
noise.
INT. LOU'S BEDROOM - LATER
Lou sits next to Ruben on the bed, rubs her finger over the
bump on Ruben’s head and then puts his implant on, feeling
the magnet engage with his skin.
LOU
Does it feel weird?
RUBEN
Not really.
LOU
So crazy. How'd you do it Rubi?
RUBEN
Oh I just... I worked some magic...
I have to talk to you about it
actually. I had toRICHARD'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD CALLING FOR LOU FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

83.
RICHARD (O.S.)
Lou, tu descend?
Lou pulls herself up suddenly - little manic...
LOU
I’m sorry... I have to go set up
for this... party thing for
Richard. Did he mention?
Yeah.

RUBEN

LOU
It's shitty timingRUBEN
No no no it’s great it’s cool.
LOU
I wish you told me you were coming
Rubi. I would have arranged
something for us.
RUBEN
It's cool. Sorry I justLOU
No I'm glad you're here I just feel
bad- actually we could go somewhere
tomorrow if you want? I just have
to do this thing tonightYeah cool-

RUBEN

LOU
You sure it's okay?
RUBEN
Yeah totallyINT. RICHARD’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ruben walks through the apartment toward the sounds of a
stereo blasting frenetic 60's jazz... sees/hears people
preparing food, clattering in the kitchen, loudly in
French... he peaks around the corner to the front door... Lou
is laughing with some guests arriving. She sees Ruben and
smiles at him, holding up a “gimme a sec” finger.

84.
INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - LATER
More guests... the stereo continues playing but now three
times louder than before... this is a very entrenched scene,
filled with musicians and artists. Ruben might as well be
deaf, even as his head is PUMMELED WITH SOUND. He SEES Lou
out in the yard AMONGST A GOOD LOOKING GROUP OF PEOPLE. She
is genuinely happy to see him coming over. She says something
to the others but for Ruben it's just a digital and confusing
mess of sounds. Someone says something to him but he can't
understand.
LOU
Did you get something to eat?
What?

RUBEN

Lou leans toward him.
LOU
Did you get something to eat?
Ruben nods unsure of what she said.
EXT. RICHARD’S APARTMENT - EVENING
Ruben stands by himself, just trying to get through it. Lou
steals a glance at him from afar.
INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - EVENING
The sounds are more intense now as people continue to drink.
The harsh sound of a fork hitting a glassNow we break out of Ruben's perspective and Richard finishes
hitting his glass. The room quiets.
RICHARD (FRENCH SUBTITLED)
I would like to ask my daughter to
join me for a song.
Papa no-

LOU

RICHARD (FRENCH SUBTITLED)
Come Louise. It is my birthday. Is
that fair?
The crowd likes the idea. Lou does not. Ruben watches her,
unsure what is happening. Lou concedes, walks up to her
father to much applause.

85.
Ruben watches her but she doesn’t look at him. She stands
next to her father. Richard whispers something in Lou's ear.
Lou flushes, nods - sits at the piano.
RICHARD (FRENCH SUBTITLED) (CONT'D)
Some of you here knew Louise's
mother. And you know I wrote many
songs for her. This one was
Louise's favorite.
(looks at Louise)
You remember?
Lou nods. Richard sits at the piano. Ruben stares at Lou,
standing awkwardly behind him. Richard begins to play the
piano and smiles warmly at Lou and nods. Lou sings in French,
her voice pure and simple. Richard joins her, his once smooth
crooning voice is now a scratchy grumble but it mixes with
Lou's voice surprisingly well. The words they're singing
together clearly have great meaning to both of them. Lou
doesn’t look at Ruben as she sings but Ruben stares deep into
her eyes. There is no mistaking her connection to the
experience and her father’s world around her. Through Ruben’s
digital ears, Lou and Richard are a beautiful, fractured
tragedy of sound. The song ends and there is a beat of
silence before the applause, the sound shattering Ruben’s
ears. Lou looks away...
INT. LOU'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Ruben sits on the bed and glances at Lou as she gets ready to
join him. Her movements are awkward. She comes to the bed and
sits. She turns to Ruben, maybe for the first time since she
sang. She reaches out and sweetly rubs his ear - Ruben
ignores the loud scratchy sound. He pulls her toward him and
kisses her. The kissing intensifies between them and then Lou
pulls back and reaches for her glass.
LOU
Sorry I need water.
You okay?

RUBEN

LOU
Yeah. It's just really dry in here.
Lou drinks... puts the glass down and slips back into place
next to Ruben... she fondles his ear gently.
LOU (CONT'D)
You’re good?

86.
RUBEN
Yeah. Fine.
Beat.
LOU
So tell me how you did this.
The
This?

RUBEN
(pointing at his ears)

LOU
Yeah. That.
Lou stares at Ruben.
LOU (CONT'D)
Where'd the money come from?
RUBEN
It ah... I have to talk to you
about that. It's complicatedLOU
What did you doRUBEN
I just borrowed... I mean I have to
talk to you about it but... it's
cool... we'll talk tomorrow. I'm so
fucking exhausted.
Lou can see she's not getting the truth.
Okay.

LOU

Beat. Ruben taps his leg. Awkward silence...
RUBEN
That was cool tonight. You sounded
really good.
LOU
Haha right.
RUBEN
No really. Straight up. You sounded
amazing singing like that.
LOU
Anyways. Thank you.

87.
RUBEN
Yeah I’m just saying - you were in
it.
LOU
Well. I don’t know. It's my dads
stuff.
Lou fidgets awkwardly. Ruben sighs.
RUBEN
This is a pretty amazing place.
LOU
Yeah well... it doesn't have
wheels.
RUBEN
That's true. But it's cool here.
All these fancy French people and
shit... has it been weird here...
must be weirdRuben looks at Lou. She looks radiant. She looks away.
LOU
It's been crazy... lots of really
crazy stuff has happenedRUBEN
Wow I bet. You're speaking French
now. I didn't even know you could
do thatLOU
Barely. I had mostly forgotten. But
it's coming back a little.
Beat. Ruben looks around at the room.
RUBEN
You remember this place at all?
LOU
Now I do. Yeah- It's disconcerting
some of the things we hold onto in
our memory without knowing we're
holding onto it...
Lou looks off with a very sad look in her eye.
LOU (CONT'D)
Just, I don't know. We never talked
about it... ever.
(MORE)

88.
LOU (CONT'D)
So this place was just a weird
dreamy idea. But some things have
come back now...
Lou looks at Ruben.
LOU (CONT'D)
I told everyone about our little
gypsy life...
Ruben keeps looking away.
I miss it.

LOU (CONT'D)

RUBEN
Who's everyone?
LOU
Just people I've metRUBEN
Uh huh... yeah we gotta get back in
it Lulu. Back in the fucking
groove. I have to get back and get
the airstream sorted and stuff.
LOU
What do you mean sorted?
RUBEN
Well... just...
Ruben gulps, can't get him self to bring up the money.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
Just... I don't know. Got a lot to
do.
LOU
You mean with the tour?
RUBEN
The tour... everything. We gotta
get on it!
Ruben looks down. When he looks up, Lou is looking away. He
notices her scratching her arm in the spot she used to
scratch. He stares at her fingernail grinding into her skin.
He looks at her face and at the picture of them together in
front of the airstream, Lou like a different person then.
Ruben's eyes take in the truth of Lou now. She can't go back
with him. And he can't stay. The revelation is devastating.

89.
He sits with it, then reaches out and stops her hand from
scratching. Lou doesn't look up for a moment. Then she does.
RUBEN (CONT'D)
It's okay Lulu.
Lou stares at Ruben, a crushing sadness coming over her.
What?
It's okay.

LOU
RUBEN

LOU
What's okay?
Ruben stares at her and nods, hardly believing the truth he
suddenly knows. He stares.
What?

LOU (CONT'D)

RUBEN
You saved my life and you made it
beautiful.
Lou hears this like a gunshot.
LOU
What are you saying?
She looks at Ruben, sees an emotion in him she's never seen.
He covers his face, shaking.
LOU (CONT'D)
You saved my life too Rubi.
She puts a hand on him and they wrap themselves around each
other, holding tight.
INT. LOU'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
Ruben glances down at Lou asleep in bed in the blue light of
early morning Paris. He quietly pulls a shirt on. He looks at
Lou again for one last moment.
EXT. RICHARD’S APARTMENT - MORNING
Ruben opens the door to the street and steps out with his
bag. Even the early morning street noise hits his brain hard.

90.
EXT. PARIS - MOMENTS LATER
Now Paris is awake and loud as Ruben walks through it. The
sound kills his head...
EXT. PARIS STREET - LATER
Ruben sits on a bench in front of a cathedral square as the
sounds of tourists, flocking pigeons, children, coalesce in a
crazy horrible cacophony. Then, to add to the chorus the
church bells start ringing. Their clanging slams at Ruben’s
brain. The world around him is a crazy chaotic mess. His
first impulse is rage. He reaches up and removes the devices
from his ears. Everything goes instantly silent. He breathes.
The morning sun breaks over the slate on the steeple. He
breathes again, something shifts, his eyes fall over the many
moments around him, no longer abrasive, they each have a
singular, silent beauty. He looks up at the church bells as
they swing silently back and forth...
