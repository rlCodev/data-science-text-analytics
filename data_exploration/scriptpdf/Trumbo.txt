CUT TO:
EXT. LAZY-T RANCH - 1947 - DAWN
Alone in a vast, serrated mountain range a hundred miles
north of Los Angeles, it looks from the outside like a rustic
sprawl. The day is a gold sliver in a navy sky.
INT. LAZY-T RANCH - BATHROOM - DAWN
Writer DALTON TRUMBO, 41, debonair, heartfelt and combative,
is naked in a tub, his copyholder on a wood plank as the
steam rises.
INT. LAZY-T RANCH - TRUMBO’S STUDY - DAWN
Like the whole home, beautifully appointed. Trumbo, kindled
cigarette in its holder, attacks the keys of a typewriter on
his desk, the fastest two-fingered typist ever as we -QUICKLY CUT AROUND HIS OFFICE,

TIGHT ON TRUMBO’S TYPEWRITER
As the inky letters CHOP movie dialogue across the white
paper, Trumbo writing like a boxer working a speed bag -MANNY:

- Trumbo as a World War II correspondent in his dress
uniform, boarding a plane.
- Trumbo in muddy fatigues, among battered SOLDIERS on a
battle-scarred beach in the South Pacific.

Words racing across the page:
What we all want.

In them, WE SEE both Trumbo’s furious pecking reflected on
glass, animatedly overlaying stills under glass of:
- Trumbo’s wife Cleo in a stunning portrait.
- Trumbo and Cleo with their three children, blowing out
Niki’s eighth birthday cake.
BACK TO TRUMBO AT THE TYPEWRITER
Lemony morning light now paints the windows.

Trumbo writes:

To not die young, poor...
And now we HEAR -EDWARD G. ROBINSON (PRE-LAP)
What do you want? What we all

CONTINUED:
EDWARD G. ROBINSON -- a charismatic, stocky man of 53, both
assertive and refined -- plays “MANNY,” stepping from a
sedan, moving toward a SUPPORTING PLAYER as “ROCCO,” on his
knees, bloody lip, torn jacket.
“ROCCO”
Manny, these guys... I don’t give
’em what they’re after, they’ll
kill me.
EDWARD G. ROBINSON/“MANNY”
Hold it, Rocco.
“Manny” takes out his revolver -- and aims it at “Rocco,” who
freezes as he stands.
EDWARD G. ROBINSON/“MANNY” (CONT’D)
If we don’t fight these guys,
sure, maybe you -As “Manny” gestures with the gun, its cylinder dislodges from
the barrel -- and several bullets FLY out and comically
CLATTER to the stage floor at Robinson’s feet.
Shit.

EDWARD G. ROBINSON/“MANNY” (CONT’D)

The director is out of his chair and on his feet -- SAM WOOD,
early 60s, sharp, authoritative.
Cut!
A BELL sounds.

SAM WOOD
Goin’ again, Eddie.
The CREW rustles in the shadows.

EDWARD G. ROBINSON
Sorry, Sam. Sorry, everybody. Of
course, the one day the author’s
among us.
Trumbo sits nearby, in a bespoke suit, calmly smoking.
Robinson settles in a canvas chair with his name on the back.
SAM WOOD
(as he glides past to talk
to the CAMERAMAN)
“Among us.” Sure ain’t one of us.
EDWARD G. ROBINSON
(keeping it light)
What’s the brilliant line, Trumbo?

DALTON TRUMBO
“If we don’t fight these guys,
sure, maybe you get that long,
happy life we all want.”
EDWARD G. ROBINSON
Then what is it you’ve got me
fighting for again?
DALTON TRUMBO
“Peace on Earth, good will toward
men.”
Nearby, Wood SNORTS.

Yeah, right.

EDWARD G. ROBINSON
You can’t do that, this is America.
DALTON TRUMBO
How about sex and money?
EDWARD G. ROBINSON
There you go, two things we all
love. None of your little sermons
on citizenship.
EXT. A BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT
A flat half-acre dominated by a massive pool that GLOWS with
a hundred floating candles. A PARTY where:
- MEN are in black tie, WOMEN in gowns, everyone smokes,
everyone drinks. Different time, different world.
- There’s MUSIC from a live BIG BAND.
VOICES overlap and compete as we snag snippets:
PARTYGOER 1
“...I don’t love it but Zanuck
does...”
PARTYGOER 2
“...make the Indians the good guys,
that’s the twist...”
PARTYGOER 3
“Now the actors want to go on
strike. Who’s next? Lassie?”
CLEO TRUMBO, 30s, hovers at the edge of a GROUP OF WOMEN
about her age.

She’s beautiful, observant, sensitive, often silent, as she
is here, excusing herself with a warm smile to look for
someone at the party, passing by -A GROUP OF MEN. Louder, more boisterous.
Edward G. Robinson.

Within that group,

EDWARD G. ROBINSON
(in mid-sentence)
...still doing reshoots, what else?
Luckily, Mayer lined up the A Team,
Sam Wood to shoot, Dalton Trumbo
for rewrites, so, fingers
crossed...
From across the lawn, TWO MALE VOICES suddenly RISE, so we
hear before we see:
SAM WOOD (O.S.)
...Jesus, Trumbo, a goddamn sixmonth strike, for what?
DALTON TRUMBO (O.S.)
(dryly)
Well, I think... money.
Cleo Trumbo turns to that second VOICE with minor dread and
as she does, she and Robinson clock one another with the same
thought: Jesus, here we go...
As they both zero in on:
Director Sam Wood, more than a little drunk.
SAM WOOD
Laugh it up. I had no crew! I
couldn’t work -(shouting at Trumbo)
-- you wouldn’t work, God forbid
you cross a picket line. For set
builders. What do set builders
have to do with writing?
DALTON TRUMBO
What writers write, builders build.
What they build, you film. You
make all the money you possibly
can, so do I, why shouldn’t they?
And why can’t we help them? In the
long run, it’s better for everyone -

SAM WOOD
-- said the Swimming Pool Soviet.
DALTON TRUMBO
(calmly)
Sam. You won. The strike’s over,
the union’s history. We’ve all
gone back to being good little
worker bees making sweet movie
honey and you -(now, just a little sharp)
-- might just try being a gracious
winner.
That last comes with a gentle poke into Wood’s lapel from
Trumbo’s fingers, which hold his cigarette. Wood does not
appreciate the jab or the accompanying smoke in his face.
SAM WOOD
It’s never over with you people -strike, after strike, after strike!
Wood is SHOUTING now. Among the Guests: HEADS turn... SMILES
falter... CONVERSATIONS stop.
SAM WOOD (CONT’D)
Y’know what? I’m going on strike -against people WHO GO ON STRIKE!
DALTON TRUMBO
And I won’t cross your picket line,
either.
Wood might just shove Trumbo now, he’s so angry, but --- suddenly, Robinson is there to get Wood’s arm in a
friendly grasp.
EDWARD G. ROBINSON
(with jovial aplomb)
Sam, Sam, Sam, we’ve got to talk
about those scenes tomorrow,
disaster, who the hell wrote that
crap?
(a wink at Trumbo, steering
Wood away)
But first, may I have this
dance...?
At the same time, Cleo takes her husband’s hand and moves him
in the opposite direction.

They kiss and move to the bar, passing --- a tall, broad MAN of 39 who eyes Trumbo the way a western
sheriff would a gunfighter. We don’t know it yet, but:
This is JOHN WAYNE.
And as his eyes follow the Trumbos, he meets the gaze of a
WOMAN. Late middle years, trim, striking, grand yet folksy,
always in a stylish hat. Wayne and she share a moment of
silent understanding. We don’t know it yet, but:
This is HEDDA HOPPER.

Actual black & white documentary footage of a waving WINSTON
CHURCHILL, grimly addressing an assembly:

the work of dangerous radicals.
A NEW CLOSE-UP (TO BE SHOT) -- SOMEONE standing on an apple
box, addressing a peaceful line of studio PICKETERS:
It’s Dalton Trumbo, his black & white face 40 feet high:
DALTON TRUMBO (ON SCREEN)
...this is what angers and
frightens the studios!
DOWN IN THE THEATRE
The Trumbo family is silently stunned. Trumbo’s own jaw
slackens just a bit at the surreal sight of himself up on
screen, then he quickly regains his composure. But his
oldest child can’t help herself -NIKI
Dad, is that you?
He nods curtly, pats her arm and the tiny, color, real Trumbo
down here watches:
THE ENORMOUS BLACK & WHITE FACE OF TRUMBO - UP ON SCREEN
Delivering this searing union rallying cry to the assembled,
among whom we glimpse an APPLAUDING Edward G. Robinson:
DALTON TRUMBO (ON SCREEN)
We’ve discovered where our true
power lies! Builders, cameramen,
painters, drivers, writers, actors,
directors! We are a single,
indivisible brotherhood of workers.
Bargain with a few of us, you
bargain with all of us! Threaten
one, you threaten us all and it’s
war! We are many but from this day
forward -- we are one!

Trumbo doesn’t meet her questioning gaze, just smokes and
stoically takes in:
HEDDA HOPPER - UP ON SCREEN
Dwarfing him:
HEDDA HOPPER (ON SCREEN)
Which is why we must know: Who
exactly was behind that walk-out...

The CAMERA SINGLES OUT a bald, fifty-ish New Jerseyite -HEDDA HOPPER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Congressman J. Parnell Thomas and
his House Un-American Activities
Committee.
CONGRESSMAN THOMAS (ON SCREEN)
Communism is not some faraway
threat; its most dangerous agents

enemies they are.

It is not.

Radical, maybe. Dangerous, only to
men who fling Cokes.

Walking with Robinson, Trumbo crosses the gleaming, BUSY
dream factory at the height of its productivity, stops at a
newsstand to buy cigarettes and is confronted by a strange
and awful sight:
The face of Hedda Hopper on the July 28, 1947 cover of TIME
magazine, the copies all hung in a line, creating two dozen
identical Heddas. Trumbo is quietly amused, Robinson
slightly horrified.
