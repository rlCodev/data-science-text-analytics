INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD HALLWAY - NIGHT

1

Florescent lighting illuminates the hallway of the ward. It’s
bright and stretches the entire length of the building.
The CAMERA moves down the hall. Up ahead, an ORDERLY
struggles with a PATIENT who is refusing to stand up.
A NURSE moves in to assist.
The CAMERA turns toward an open door marked ADMINISTRATION
OFFICE. We move into the office.

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD OFFICE - NIGHT

2

The HEAD NURSE is standing at a filing cabinet - her fingers
flip through the files at lightning speed.
She is mumbling to herself about: “understaffed, underpaid,
feet hurting, lazy co-workers...”, among other things.
The office is organized chaos. Files, papers, prescription
bottles and clip boards take over the surface of several work
stations.
In the background phones are ringing. Patients are yelling
for medications - but it’s secondary to the incessant ringing
of the phones.
The Head Nurse pulls a file and walks toward the multi-line
phone system that has been ringing off the hook.
She picks up each line as if working a telethon. The tone of
her voice is one of frustration, border-lining on rude - yet
she maintains a professional demeanor.
HEAD NURSE
Statewood Hospital, please hold.
(Another call.)
Statewood Hospital, please hold.
Another PHONE is ringing but this one is coming from
somewhere in the lobby.
HEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
(Another call.)
Statewood Hospital, please hold.
MARY, a FEMALE PATIENT comes up to the window. She stands
there, staring at the Head Nurse.

HEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
Statewood, thank you for holding.
(Beat.)
Yes. Give me a moment and I’ll page
him, hold on.
The lobby phone rings.
The Head Nurse turns to an INTERCOM MICROPHONE. She presses
down on the base of it.
Her voice echoes over the dated speaker system.
HEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
Dr. Sanders you have a call on line
two. Dr. Sanders, please pick up
line two.
She turns to the Patient who has been staring at her through
the circular glass partition window. Without missing a beatHEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
(Firm.)
It’s not time for your medication
yet Mary. Go back to your room
...now.
She unhappily walks away.
The lobby phone rings.
HEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
Will someone please pick up the
phone?
Apparently no one is nearby. She picks up one of the calls on
hold.
HEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
Thank you for holding. Hi, yes I
have the patient file you’ve
requested. I’ll bring it over to
you now.
She hangs up, takes a deep breath and makes her way out of
the office. We follow her out of the door, into the hallway,
which immediately opens into the lobby.

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD LOBBY - NIGHT

3

A few chairs, a magazine rack, a glass encased bulletin board
and several fake plants are all the lobby consists of.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

3.

The cold, tiled flooring and bright lighting make this an
unappealing and sterile environment to say the least.
SEVERAL PATIENTS mill about.
The NURSE from a moment earlier is walking MARY, the female
patient, who was staring through the glass partition, in the
opposite direction.
A JANITOR mops around a Yellow “Wet Floor” sign” sitting in
the middle of the lobby.
We stay on the Head Nurse. She is walking toward 4 PAY PHONES
mounted side by side on the wall of the Ward Lobby. This is
the source of the ringing.
Underneath the phones, a counter top runs the length of them.
4 wood chairs with a soft, padded seat are under the counter
top in front of each phone.
The Head Nurse points her finger at another ORDERLY
walking from the opposite hallway. His sleeves are rolled up,
his one arm is sporting a few TATTOOS.
HEAD NURSE
(Stern.)
Roll down your sleeves and get
these patients back into their
rooms before the evening medication
rounds please.
The Orderly quickly rolls down his sleeves and begins to
round up the patients.
Again, the phone rings, thenHEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
(She picks up.)
Hello?
(Beat.)
Yes, please hold.
She places the receiver on top of the phone, turns and walks
down the long stretch of hallway.
The CAMERA stays with her.
A PATIENT crosses in front of her just before she stops short
of an OPEN DOOR.
The Head Nurse pops her head in the door. From over her
shoulder we catch a glance of the TV. STATIC fills the
screen.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

HEAD NURSE (CONT’D)
Elizabeth. You have a phone call.
The Head Nurse keeps moving down the hallway. We stay with
her to a SECOND DOOR of the same room.

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

4

The CAMERA turns into the common room, PANNING down to the
floor, stopping just short of a COUCH. We don’t see much of
the room.
A moment later, the feet of ELIZABETH come down from the
couch, touching the floor. They are covered in thick, nonslip hospital issued socks.
We stay on her feet as she stands, walks out of the room and
into the ward hallway.
5

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD HALLWAY - NIGHT

Elizabeth’s footsteps are light, almost silent as she walks
down the hall.
The CAMERA stays on her feet, following them in the direction
we just came from.
We follow Elizabeth’s feet as she makes her way into the
lobby, toward the phones.
6

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD LOBBY - NIGHT

6

Elizabeth takes a seat in front of the phone.
We stay TIGHT - revealing nothing more than Elizabeth’s feet,
hands, legs, arms, fingers, ears, nose and lips. We never see
her entire face throughout the scene. From the various angles
we can see she is dressed in sweat pants and a baggy
sweatshirt.
Elizabeth picks up the phone but she does not answer it yet.
We are TIGHT on her fingers as Elizabeth plays with the cord,
intertwining it around her fingers - a nervous tick caused by
anxiety. It’s almost as if she doesn’t want to speak too
whomever is on the call.
We can’t help but notice the black rubber hair band wrapped
around her wrist.
She sits with her right knee up, her other foot planted on
the floor. She finally brings the phone to her ear.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

5.

We PAN UP just enough - exposing Elizabeth’s chin and mouth.
Hello.
Hi Lizzy.

ELIZABETH
CAROL (O.C.)

ELIZABETH
Mom, please don’t call me Lizzy.
Carol’s tone shifts to one of annoyance.
CAROL (O.C.)
Sorry. How are you feeling?
ELIZABETH
I have news.
CAROL (O.C.)
What kind of news Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH
I’m going home tomorrow.
Carol’s tone changes from annoyed to tolerant - cautious
even.
CAROL (O.C.)
That’s wonderful honey. I ...I wish
I was able to be there but your
Stepsister has her piano recital
and Richard is coaching Thomas....
Elizabeth cuts her off mid sentence. She could care less
about her Mother’s new family and life.
ELIZABETH
It’s okay Mom. Grant’s picking me
up.
(Beat.)
And he’s moving in.
Once again you can hear the tone change in her Mother’s
voice. It’s a mixture of confusion and concern.
CAROL (O.C.)
He is? That’s, um ...well...
(Clears her throat.)
Am I ever going to meet him?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

6.

ELIZABETH
Mom, do you really want me to get
into the reasons why you haven’t
met Grant?
(She bites at one of her
fingernails.)
I’m going home tomorrow. I have a
new doctor. We start sessions next
week. I plan on getting well Mom. I
want to have a life and be as
normal as possible.
CAROL (O.C.)
That’s great sweetheart, but...
Elizabeth cuts her off again. Her tone becomes agitated.
ELIZABETH
No buts Mom. I don’t want to be
upset or have feelings of
resentment toward you anymore but
right now I need to focus on what’s
best for me.
CAROL (O.C.)
I just don't want you taking your
mental health lightly. Moving in
with someone is a big deal
Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH
I know that.
Elizabeth is trying hard not to let her Mother spoil the
moment but the foot tapping, nail biting and skin scratching
tell us otherwise. She is full of anxiety and annoyance now.
She takes a deep breath - raising her hand to her neck,
gripping it as if she were gasping for air or trying to choke
herself. It’s hard to tell.
CAROL (O.C.)
(Beat.)
I’ll try to make a trip up from San
Diego soon.
Elizabeth bites her lip in thought.
CAROL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
Are you there Elizabeth?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

I’m here.
(Beat)
Mom?
Yes?

ELIZABETH

CAROL (O.C.)

ELIZABETH
Grant asked me to marry him and I
said yes.
There is a long silence.
Mom?
I’m here.

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
CAROL (O.C.)

ELIZABETH
You’re not happy?
CAROL (O.C.)
It’s just.
(Beat.)
I had a very different idea of what
I thought your life would be. But,
you’re a 30 year old woman and you
can make your own choices.
ELIZABETH
He makes me happy.
CAROL (O.C.)
Then that’s all ...that matters.
It becomes uncomfortably silent, thenCAROL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
(In a hurry.)
I have to go. Your Step sister just
knocked over ...a bowl. I’ll see
you soon. Gotta run.
Before Elizabeth can say anything elseCLICK! The phone hangs up.
The phone still to her earELIZABETH
Sure Mom...

Elizabeth lets the phone move down the side of her face,
gently leaning her chin on it. She then releases the phone,
letting it dangle from the cord.
She removes the black hair band from her wrist and sloppily
ties her hair up.
She stands, takes a deep breath, then defiantly SLAMS the
phone down onto the receiver and weCUT TO: BLACK

INT. ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

7

The studio apartment is small and clean with a mixture of
mismatched furniture and knickknacks.
We PAN around the room revealing the lay out.
A FUTON SOFA BED with matching END and COFFEE TABLES sit
opposite a small FLAT SCREEN TV inside a WOOD TV CABINET.
There are three small WINDOWS with WHITE WOOD BLINDS in the
main living area.
A ROUND TABLE with two chairs sits just outside the small
kitchen nook.
A small WOOD DESK covered with a stack of books, a
manuscript, pens, pencils, ruler and a high lighter sit off
in another corner.
Left over CHINESE FOOD containers and two paper plates with
plastic ware are on the coffee table.
The sound of KEYS are heard, then - the door swings open.
ELIZABETH steps into the apartment - exposing her face for
the first time.
She is a rare combination of beauty and innocence but her
face wears a deep sadness and underlying pain.
She is wearing black tights and a baggy sweatshirt that
despite itself, outlines her slender body.
She holds a BACKPACK in her left hand. Her big, gentle eyes
move across the room, taking it all in. By the expression on
her face, it’s as if it all seems unfamiliar. Just then-

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

9.

GRANT enters. He stands tall and handsome. He possesses a
natural warmth and charm. He is emotionally strong,
compassionate and filled with unconditional love for
Elizabeth.
Grant walks up behind her, kissing her neck.
GRANT
Give me your bag babe, I’ll unpack
for you.
Elizabeth circles back around and quickly shuts the door.
ELIZABETH
No I’m okay. I’m going to take a
shower and throw this stuff in the
dirty clothes.
She indicates the contents of her backpack.
GRANT
Okay. I’ll be right here. I’ll give
you some alone time to get settled.
Can I get you anything?
Tea?

ELIZABETH

GRANT
Coming right up.
He leans in, kisses her forehead. He walks out of frame
toward the small kitchen.
Elizabeth stands there for what feels like an eternity taking in her place.
She looks to the right of her - staring blankly. She walks
out of frame.
8

INT. ELIZABETH’S BATHROOM - DAY
The dark room turns bright by the flick of a switch.
We are TIGHT on Elizabeth’s hand as she closes the bathroom
door knob.
Elizabeth steps in front of her bathroom mirror. She stands
there looking back at herself in the reflection.
CLOSE ON the SHOWER HEAD as a burst of water sputters out
from weeks of being still. Elizabeth’s hand reaches in to
test the temperature.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

10.

Elizabeth looks over her shoulder as if she heard something.
She does a double take before sliding out of her clothes.
She steps into the shower, quickly pulling the shower door
closed. She’s feeling paranoid.
The warm water hits her body. The expression on her face is a
mixture of relief and angst. She takes a long, deep breath
then sticks her head under the running water. She is
beautiful and broken all at once.
The muffled sound of a tea kettle can be heard whistling from
the kitchen.
GRANT (O.C.)
Babe, tea is ready.
ELIZABETH
Okay, I’ll be right out.
Elizabeth continues to stand in the shower - in her own
world. She feels safe enclosed in the shower.
Suddenly a feeling of nervousness overcomes her again. Her
body shudders from a chill. She doesn't feel alone in the
bathroom.
She looks behind her. She mumbles to herself - trying to
remain calm but paranoia is getting the best of her.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(Quick and muffled.)
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay,
it’s okay.
She turns the water off, then on again, then off again. When
she is sure it’s off she quickly steps out of the shower.
She grabs a worn-in bathrobe hanging on the back of the
bathroom door - quickly holding it up in front of herself as
if hiding her naked body from someone.
Elizabeth places the robe to her nose - smelling it.
Something about this is oddly calming to her. She stands for
a moment - embracing the robe.
Elizabeth puts the robe on - tying it tightly around her
waist. Her small frame is devoured by the oversized terrycloth. She grabs a towel hanging on a near-by rack and begins
to dry her hair.
The tea kettle continues to scream from the kitchen while she
stares at her reflection - gently patting her face dry.

INT. ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

9

Elizabeth and Grant are sitting on opposite sides of the
couch. She is still in her bathrobe - a cup of tea gripped in
her hands. She is staring into it.
The containers of old Chinese food remain in the same spot on
the coffee table. Grant points to it.
GRANT
I didn’t throw it out. I figured we
could heat it up and share.
ELIZABETH
You read my mind. I’ve been craving
month old Chinese food.
GRANT
Awesome. I knew it.
He’s happy to see her and it shows.
GRANT (CONT’D)
Drink your tea.
Elizabeth moves toward him, leaning her back against him.
Grant places his arm around her.
Elizabeth takes a sip of her tea.
Good?

GRANT (CONT’D)

Elizabeth manages a smile.
GRANT (CONT’D)
Feel good to be home?
ELIZABETH
I never want to go back to that
place.
They sit in silence for a moment, thenGRANT
When do you want to go over your
new medications? We should do that
before your next doctor’s
appointment.
ELIZABETH
Tomorrow. I just need to be with
you right now and not think.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

Sure babe.

12.

GRANT

Grant caresses her arm and shoulder.
The remainder of their conversation seems like it should have
more joy to it but with Elizabeth her thoughts are always
heavy.
ELIZABETH
What did your friends say when you
told them you were moving in with
me?
GRANT
They said, can we help you pack?
Elizabeth gives Grant “a look” from over her shoulder.
GRANT (CONT’D)
All joking aside, everyone is
really happy for us.
ELIZABETH
That’s nice to hear. Did you choose
a best man?
GRANT
Nah. I’ll figure it out when the
time comes. My buddies are placing
bets to see who I pick.
Elizabeth is deep in thought, thenELIZABETH
I told my Mother.
GRANT
How’d that go?
Elizabeth sits up and places her tea on the coffee table. She
ties her hair back in a loose knot.
ELIZABETH
(Sarcastic.)
It was a conversation filled with
grief and disappointment. So all
and all I’d say it went pretty
good.
GRANT
Do you think she’ll meet me before
we get married?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16
Elizabeth looks straight ahead at nothing in particular.
ELIZABETH
I don’t know.
(Beat.)
And I honestly don’t care.
GRANT
You care. It’s your Mother, I know
you care. You can pretend to be
tough all you want Elizabeth but I
know you better than you know
yourself.
ELIZABETH
(Sarcastic, yet playful.)
You think you know me, huh?
I know so.

GRANT

She stares into his eyes.
He pulls her tight. Their foreheads meet.
GRANT (CONT’D)
I know you better than you know
yourself.
Elizabeth swallows hard. She loves this man so much.
Oh yeah?

ELIZABETH

GRANT
Yeah. And you know what else?
She softly shakes her head.
GRANT (CONT’D)
There’s no one else’s plate I’d
rather steal food from - so let’s
eat because I’m starving.
She laughs - gives him a playful hit.
ELIZABETH
I hate that! Why do you do it?
GRANT
What? Steal food off your plate?
Yes!

ELIZABETH

13.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

GRANT
(Thoughtful Beat.)
Because I want what you have.
A warm smiles fills her face. They embrace. They remain
locked in one another’s arms on the sofa.

INT. ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

11

Streaks of SUNLIGHT seep through the blinds into Elizabeth’s
apartment but not enough to remove the somber feeling.
Elizabeth sits at the round table just outside the kitchen.
Her legs crossed Indian style. A glass of water and an empty
bowl with a spoon sticking out of it rest on the table.
The notebook and pen lay on the table in front of her. She
stares straight ahead - lost in her thoughts.
Elizabeth’s eyes twitch, her head shakes ever so slightly.
She places her face in her hands.
SUDDENLY, a mixture of indistinguishable VOICES begin to fill
her head. They are soft, overlapping and very present. Among
the chatter we can barely make out the voice of TIM. This is
a hallucination we will hear from again.
TIM (V.O.)
He’s never going to marry you.
A VISIBLE CHILL causes Elizabeth’s body to shutter. She rubs
her neck and arms quickly to relieve the sensation. A deep
strain fills her face. She grips the bridge of her nose with
her thumb and index finger, massaging in tiny circles.
The VOICES are dissolving but still present.
Elizabeth covers her ears and places her head down - her
forehead touching the pad on the table.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

15.

She lets out a faint sigh and whispers to herself.
ELIZABETH
Please leave me alone.
Elizabeth keeps her eyes planted on the pad. We follow her
eyes to the pen.
Her hand comes into frame - picking up the pen. She raises
her head and begins to write frantically in different
directions, rotating the notebook in the process.
CLOSE on the Notebook-Mrs. O’Neil
She rotates the notebook.
-Mrs. Grant O’Neil
She rotates the notebook.
-Mrs. Elizabeth O’Neil

-Mrs. Elizabeth Grant O’Neil

-Mrs. Grant Elizabeth O’Neil
She rotates the notebook but before she writes again we hearGRANT (O.C.)
You know some people might consider
that a compulsive behavior.
Without looking up, Elizabeth manages an anxiety ridden
smile.
Grant takes a seat at the table opposite her.
ELIZABETH
Well dear sir, as you may already
know, among my many issues, I am
also obsessive compulsive and
currently on medication for it.
Grant looks at the notebook.
GRANT
Umm, yeah. Looks like the meds are
really doing their job.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

16.

GRANT (CONT'D)
What medication is that again? 350
milligrams of it’s not working?
ELIZABETH
No jerk. It’s called Luvox ...and I
actually think it’s the only
medication that’s working.
She looks down, picks up her pen and taps it three times on
the notebook. TAP! TAP! TAP!
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
This is more my anxiety than
obsessiveness.
GRANT
Did you take anything?
ELIZABETH
No, I don’t like the Ativan. It
makes me itchy. It must be some
weird side effect.
Grants responds sarcastically under his breath.
GRANT
Or you have a rash.
Elizabeth dips her fingers into the glass of water and flicks
a splash at him.
Hey!

GRANT (CONT’D)

ELIZABETH
What, are you going to melt?
Grants smiles - takes a moment.
GRANT
We need to go over your
medications.
Elizabeth goes back to doodling on the notebook.
Okay.

ELIZABETH

GRANT
It’s important.
Yes Grant.

ELIZABETH

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

17.

GRANT
Don’t “yes me” Elizabeth. You said
last night we would go over them
today. I wanna have a handle on it
before we meet with Dr. Bowman.
ELIZABETH
(Agitated.)
Please don’t start with me.
GRANT
I’m not starting. I just don’t take
your mental health lightly.
ELIZABETH
Oh what and I do? You sound like my
Mother.
Before he can respond, Elizabeth slams the pen down and
storms out of the room.
OFF CAMERA, from the other room, we hear her mumbling to
herself about “everyone telling her what to do”, tired of
being treated like a child”, among other things. Then - a
cabinet opens then SLAMS closed. Grant sits quietly staring
down at the table.
She returns a few moments later holding a basket filled with
PILL BOTTLES. She dumps them all over the table and sits
down.
ELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
Fine! Lets do it now! Here
...happy?
Grant appears hurt by her outburst. Slowly his expression
changes to a grin. He looks at all of the pills.
GRANT
Any of these treat rotten bitch
syndrome?
Elizabeth gives him a “look”.
A moment of regret crosses her face for the way she reacted.
She begins picking up the pill bottles, lining them up in a
row, side-by-side on the table. Among the various pill
bottles there is also a DAILY PLASTIC PILL CASE.
GRANT (CONT’D)
(Cautiously.)
Sooo ...besides the anxiety, how do
you feel?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

18.

Elizabeth keeps her head down - her long hair draping over
her face as she flips open the plastic lid on each day of the
pill case.
ELIZABETH
Okay, I guess.
GRANT
Are you hearing?
ELIZABETH
I was, a little. Not too bad.
GRANT
Are they here now?
ELIZABETH

No.

Grant moves her hair behind one of her ears then places his
hand under her chin, tilting her head up to make eye contact
with him.
GRANT
Hey ...I love you.
ELIZABETH
I love you too.
Without saying another word, one by one she opens the pill
bottles and begins to place a pill from each bottle into the
daily pill case. As she continues to do this Grant can see
she is getting overwhelmed. He extends his hand and places it
on the table.
Elizabeth reaches for it. We hold tight on them. Nothing is
said. Nothing needs to be.

back we reveal-

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

19.

Elizabeth and Grant sitting on a sofa side by side in the
Psychiatrist’s office.
Seated across from them is a WOMAN - her head buried in a
magazine.
An enclosed office with a counter top separates the lobby
from the waiting area.
TWO FEMALE STAFF MEMBERS can be seen behind the opposite side
of the counter.
To the left, there is a large light wood, unmarked double
door.
The waiting area is comfortable and inviting. A striped,
brightly colored rug and wood coffee table sit in the middle
of the room.
Spread across the top of the table are magazines fanned out
with all the latest headlines.
Elizabeth reaches for one of the magazines, sits back and
begins to flip through the pages. It more of a distraction.
She isn’t really looking at the pages. She takes a deep
breath, her nerves and anxiety are getting to her.
Grant notices how tense she is. He references a tabloid
magazine on the table with the headline: “Another Celebrity
Sex Tape Scandal”.
GRANT
Maybe we should make a sex tape.
Elizabeth forces a grin. It’s the best she can muster at the
moment. Just then, the double doors open.
DR. BOWMAN stands in the doorway. He is wearing an expensive
shirt, silk tie and slacks pressed to perfection. He is
holding a medical file. He greets Elizabeth with a welcoming
smile.
Elizabeth?

DR. BOWMAN

Elizabeth nods.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
I’m Doctor Bowman. Please, come in.
She and Grant stand. Grant walks into his office, followed by
Elizabeth.
Dr. Bowman closes the door behind them.

INT. DR. BOWMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

14

The office is large and bright. The room is painted a cool,
baby blue that makes you feel immediately at ease.
A large, slightly elevated window covered by thick, vertical
blinds allows just enough sunlight in, giving the room a warm
feel.
A stylishly upholstered couch, flanked by two antique end
tables with a wood and metal coffee table are to the left of
the door.
To the far end of the office - warm wood furnishings
comprised of Dr. Bowman’s desk, leather desk chair and
bookcase are neatly organized. His medical degrees are
beautifully framed above his desk.
Dr. Bowman makes his way toward a comfy chair on the opposite
side of the coffee table, across from the couch.
DR. BOWMAN
I’ve heard a lot about you from Dr.
Sanders Elizabeth. It’s nice to
finally meet you.
ELIZABETH
It’s nice to meet you too Dr.
Bowman. This is my fiance, Grant.
Dr. Bowman takes a seat across from Elizabeth and Grant. He
smiles tightly, a slight squint in his eye. His demeanor is
calm and direct, yet soft and warm. His voice smooth and
soothing.
DR. BOWMAN
(Gestures to couch.)
Please, have a seat.
Elizabeth and Grant sit on the couch. Throughout the
conversation Elizabeth often appears distant, guarded and
occasionally defensive - even sarcastic at times.
Dr. Bowman takes a moment to review her medical file.
Elizabeth sits quietly holding Grant’s hand. She looks up at
the window, momentarily gazing off.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
I see here you’re currently on
Haldol for the schizophrenia.
Elizabeth reverts her attention back to Dr. Bowman.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

Yes.

21.

ELIZABETH

DR. BOWMAN
How is that working for you?
ELIZABETH
I hate it. Between the headaches,
difficulty peeing and the muscle
stiffness I feel like it’s making
me feel crazier than I am. And with
all of the other pills, the dry
mouth is enough to make me want to
scream.
Dr. Bowman removes a pen from his pocket and makes a note in
her file.
GRANT
All very sexy side effects I might
add.
She nudges him.
Shut up.

ELIZABETH

Dr. Bowman looks in Grant’s direction.
DR. BOWMAN
How long have you been on the
Haldol now?
ELIZABETH
Dr. Sanders put me on it as soon as
I was admitted into Statewood, so
about 5 weeks now.
DR. BOWMAN
And before that I see you were on
Seroquel. But it doesn’t mention
why the change.
Elizabeth looks down.
ELIZABETH
I was escorted out of a grocery
store for getting into an argument
with a Fireman - who wasn’t
actually there.
DR. BOWMAN
So you were hallucinating?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

22.

She nods her head. The questions are beginning to make her
nervous. She becomes visibly anxious and fidgety - nail
biting, hand rubbing, foot tapping and scratching. It’s
subtle but very apparent.
ELIZABETH
The Police were called and I was
taken to the hospital.
DR. BOWMAN
And is that the first time you
received in-patient treatment?
ELIZABETH
Yes. Well, no. I’ve been in and out
of hospitals over the years but
those were voluntary and mostly for
evaluation.
DR. BOWMAN
Would you say you have seen a
change in certain behaviors in
recent years?
ELIZABETH
I’d say it started getting worse a
little over a year ago.
Dr. Bowman makes another note in her file.
She turns to Grant.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Not long before we first started
dating. Lucky you.
Grant’s expression is one of complete support.
Dr. Bowman looks in Grant’s direction again.
DR. BOWMAN
And while under the care of Dr.
Sanders he took you off of the
Seroquel and placed you on the
Haldol for your schizophrenia.
He flips through her file, reviewing her history.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
And I also see here that you’re
currently taking Luvox for your OCD
and Ativan for anxiety.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

Yes.

23.

ELIZABETH

DR. BOWMAN
And other than the side effects you
mentioned, do you feel that this
current combination of medications
is working for you?
ELIZABETH
No. I hate the Ativan. It makes me
itchy.
Dr. Bowman looks back down at her file. He is making notes
while reading others. His eyes remain in the file.
Elizabeth begins PETTING “something” on the couch beside her.
It’s subtle, understated but very real to her.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
And the Haldol isn’t working
either. I’m still hearing voices
almost every day. I feel like the
Luvox is the only thing working but
it’s not 100%.
DR. BOWMAN
And did you tell all of this to Dr.
Sanders?
Elizabeth is becoming visibly upset.
Yes.

ELIZABETH

DR. BOWMAN
And what did he say?
Dr. Bowman looks up at her. He notices the petting for the
first time.
ELIZABETH
Give it time. I did. It’s not
working.
Elizabeth catches herself petting. She becomes selfconscious, pulling her hand away and clasping them tightly
against her chest to keep them occupied.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Sorry.
(Beat.)
Sometimes I see raccoons.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

She looks toward the imaginary raccoon.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I can’t help myself but pet them.
I’m really sorry.
She looks down, momentarily embarrassed. Grant comforts her.
Dr. Bowman smiles warmly. He makes another note in her file,
then leans forward - his tone reassuring.
DR. BOWMAN
It’s perfectly okay Elizabeth. You
don’t have to apologize to me for
anything. Mental illness doesn’t
need to be treated like a dirty
secret. This is a safe environment.
No one is going to judge you here.
She looks up at him. For the first time Elizabeth feels at
ease in Dr. Bowman’s presence.
ELIZABETH
I need a doctor who will listen to
me. Not just medicate me.
Her comment strikes a cord.
DR. BOWMAN
Tell me a little about yourself
Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH
Umm, well. I’m 30 and ...I’m
getting married soon.
She smiles and leans into Grant.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I’d like to get back to work but I
want to make sure I’m, you know,
capable enough.
DR. BOWMAN
What do you do?
ELIZABETH
I’m a book editor ...was.
DR. BOWMAN
Stressful work?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

25.

ELIZABETH
It can be. You have to have all of
your wits about you. You’re being
trusted with editing someone’s
work. So cutting too deep or making
the wrong edits would be bad.
DR. BOWMAN
Yes, I suppose that could be a
challenge.
They share a smile.
GRANT
So what do you think Doc?
ELIZABETH
Yes, what do you think?
DR.BOWMAN
(Reflective, yet
confident.)
I think I can help you Elizabeth.
Based on your mental health history
I believe with the proper
combination of medication and
psychotherapy you can have a
significant improvement to your
quality of life. Give me a moment.
Dr. Bowman walks out of the office.
Elizabeth looks at Grant. He gives her a reassuring smile.
Dr. Bowman returns a moment later holding a SAMPLE of Pills
and a prescription pad.
DR. BOWMAN
I’m going to start you on something
called Invega. Have you been on
this before?
She shakes her head no.
He hands her the sample, takes a seat and writes in his
prescription pad.

DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
I want to start you at a low dose.
3 milligrams daily. That way we
have room to go up.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

26.

DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
And for the anxiety, even though
itchiness is a highly unusual side
effect associated with Ativan, I
want you to start taking Klonopin once in the morning and once at
night to help balance out the
anxiousness.
He hands her the prescription.
Elizabeth manages a nervous smile.
Okay.

ELIZABETH

She stares at the prescription in her hand.
DR. BOWMAN
I’d like you to continue with the
Luvox but let’s increase the dose
to 300 milligrams per day. Once in
the morning and once at night, same
as the Klonopin. I believe this is
a very good start. Do you have any
questions for me?
Grant looks at Elizabeth.
GRANT
Babe? You have any questions for
the Doctor?
She snaps out of her daze - looks up at Grant.
No.

ELIZABETH

Dr. Bowman looks at Grant, then back to Elizabeth.
DR. BOWMAN
Okay then. I’ll see you next week
for a follow up, okay?
Elizabeth bites her lip and rubs her legs with both hands as
if she were trying to start a fire.
She stands. So does Grant.
Okay.
Dr. Bowman Stands.

ELIZABETH

INT. - ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We are TIGHT on Elizabeth’s face. Total silence but then, the
room begins to fill with the sounds of a soft RUMBLE. It
sounds like a TRAIN on tracks in the distance quickly
approaching.
Elizabeth opens her eyes wide. She listens intently. A TRAIN
HORN blows. The train is getting closer. She looks around,
thenELIZABETH
(Soft but frantic.)
Do you hear that? Do hear that? Do
hear that? Do you hear that?
The sound of the train is growing louder - it’s very close
now. Elizabeth’s face is filled with pure panic. She lays
frozen on the sofa.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
The train is coming. The train is
coming. The train is coming.
SUDDENLY, the entire room is filled with the SOUNDS of a
LOCOMOTIVE.
Elizabeth leaps up. Her voice raises, trying to shout above
the train.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
THE TRAIN IS COMING!
Grant is jolted awake. He leaps up but not before Elizabeth
bolts into the kitchen.
The CAMERA follows tight behind her, through the kitchen out
the other side and back into the living room in one-fluid
movement. All the while she is frantically repeating, over
and over and louder and louderELIZABETH (CONT’D)

coming. The train is coming.

Elizabeth there’s no train. Calm
down. There’s no train.
Elizabeth looks around in a frantic state. She is desperately
trying to figure out which direction the train is coming
from.
ELIZABETH
The TRAIN Grant. IT’S SO LOUD.
She places her hands over her ears.
Grant is trying his best to calm her down.
GRANT
Elizabeth! Listen to me. There’s no
train. Look at me! Look at me!
Elizabeth pushes him away and frantically screamsELIZABETH
GET AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY! THE
TRAIN IS COMING!
Without thinking, Grant SLAPS Elizabeth across the face.
EVERYTHING GOES DEAD QUIET - except for their breathing.
Elizabeth is in a daze from the slap.
GRANT
Baby ...I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean
it. I didn’t mean it. I’m so sorry.
I didn’t know what else to do...
Grant is panting. He looks white as ghost - he is trembling.
He embraces Elizabeth - fighting back tears.
Her eyes are empty. Grant slowly rocks her. They stand in

INT. ELIZABETH’S BATHROOM - DAY

The CAMERA is facing the tiled bathroom floor. The song,
“Today I Met The Boy I’m Going To Marry” by Darlene Love is
playing.
The CAMERA glides across the floor, panning up the side of
the bathtub, revealingElizabeth sitting in the tub. It’s filled almost to the top.
The expression on her face is blank. Empty. Her hair wet and
pulled back from her face.
The CAMERA moves above her just as she slides into the tub
submerging her entire head under the water.
Elizabeth’s eyes are wide open yet she appears lifeless. We
continue to hear the song but it’s muffled.
Her hair dances around her face. She remains under the water
for what feels like an eternity.
She raises her head above the water, folds her knees to her
chest wrapping her arms tightly around her legs - griping
them close. Her face is resting on her knees, hidden by her
hair.
The tips of Elizabeth’s hair gracefully touch the water dancing like a ballerina in a field of flowers.
She lifts her head, extending her neck back like a giraffe.
Looking upwards, toward the ceiling.
Her head back, her mouth open, her eyes blood shot.
Babe?

GRANT (O.C.)

The SONG STOPS!
Elizabeth turns her head, resting it on top of her knees.
Grant walks into frame sitting down on the floor beside the
tub. He lays his head down on the edge of the tub - his cheek
squashed, his eyes sad.
GRANT (CONT’D)
You been in here a long time.
Grant pushes her hair out of her face, tucking it behind her
ear. The CAMERA follows as his finger tips glide with care.
GRANT (CONT’D)
Can I get you anything?

Elizabeth shakes her head ever so slightly.
GRANT (CONT’D)
Did you take your pills?
Elizabeth nods.
GRANT (CONT’D)
Okay. I’ll give you some space.
She stares blankly. He reaches to stroke her head but his
hand stops just above it - trembling, before he retracts it.
Grant stands and walks out.

Elizabeth is laying on the couch in sweats and a T-shirt,
staring at the ceiling - in a daze.
Grant enters. He is sweating, hyper and excited. He kneels
down beside her.
GRANT
Get up. Get dressed. It’s December.
Her facial expression emanates her state of mind - worn out,
run down, no sign of hope.
So?

ELIZABETH

GRANT
I was jogging and I passed that
empty lot on the corner and it’s
filled with Christmas trees. Let’s
go buy one.
Elizabeth could care less.
ELIZABETH
It doesn’t feel like Christmas.
Grant is like a 10 year-old boy right now.
GRANT
It’s Los Angeles, it never feels
like Christmas. Come on. PLEASE!
Let’s go, get up.
She agrees but only so he’ll shut up.

Elizabeth walks past Grant, walking toward the bathroom.
Hurry up.

Okay, okay, you’re so annoying
sometimes.
Grant smiles, but it’s forced.

EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT - EVENING

Grant and Elizabeth stroll through the lot, flanked by
Christmas trees on either side of them. The only light is
coming from the strand of Christmas tree lights that zigzag
above the entire lot. We stay TIGHT on Grant and Elizabeth
while they walk.
OTHER CUSTOMERS roam about but they are like a blur in the
background.
GRANT
What kind of tree do you want?
Elizabeth shrugs her shoulders.
Before Grant can respond a LITTLE BOY (5), with the face of a
cherub, runs in front of Grant and Elizabeth. He trips and
falls.
Elizabeth and Grant quickly react, kneeling down to pick him
up. As he stands, the Boy brushes dirt and mulch off of
himself.
Elizabeth speaks softly and lovingly.
ELIZABETH
Are you okay?
She wipes a little dirt off his face. He nods.
GRANT
You gotta be more careful little
man.

The Boy points in an unseen direction.

Elizabeth is quiet. Her mind off somewhere else.
GRANT
Hey, where’d you go? What are you
thinking about?
ELIZABETH
I don’t know.

Do you want kids?
GRANT
Haven’t really given it a lot of
thought. Sure, I guess so.
She takes a long moment before looking at him.
ELIZABETH
Do you want to have kids with me?
GRANT
Who else would I be having them
with?
ELIZABETH
It’s just ...we never talked about
it and with me being the way I am I
wasn't sure if you would want to.
GRANT
Well I guess since we’re talking
about it now - maybe you don’t want
to have kids with me?
He starts to stroll away from her. She follows.
ELIZABETH
And why is that?

GRANT
I was quite the unpredictable kid.
I got into a lot of trouble and
fights. I even stole from the local
store on the corner of my street.

You never told me that you were a
klepto. What would you steal?
GRANT
Candy bars.

Everyday before school.
Elizabeth smiles.

So see. I think my genes might be
worse than yours.

Don’t joke.
He stops in his tracks - turning to her.
GRANT
We have to joke. If we don’t we’ll
both go insane. Literally.
She looks away. He places his hands on her face.

And our kids are going to be
awesome. They’re going to be happy
and healthy and beautiful - just

And probably bratty like you too.

Listen to me. There is no one else
I want to have a family with. I’m
prepared to share my life with you the good and the bad. And there’s
nothing we can’t get past as long
as we stick together. Do you

He takes her hand and they walk out of frame.

INT. ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The tree lights and a few candles are the only light in the
room. Elizabeth sits on the couch in tights and a sweatshirt her feet up on the coffee table. A glass of water and a
bottle of anxiety medication sit on the table beside her
feet.
We are TIGHT on the pill bottle as Elizabeth sits up. She
opens the bottle, takes 2 pills and knocks them back with
water. Grant is standing in front of the tree. It’s fully
decorated.
The song, “Dying For Ya” by August Roads is playing under the
scene.
GRANT
What do you think?
Elizabeth moves to the floor next to a box filled with
Christmas decorations.
ELIZABETH
It’s beautiful.

She mindlessly digs through the box. She removes some old,
silver tinsel.
GRANT
This is our first tree together.
A sad smile crosses his face.
GRANT (CONT’D)
I wish I had a ring to go with it.
ELIZABETH
You know I don’t care about that.
She looks at the silver tinsel. She rips a piece off, then
twists it around her finger - holding it up.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
This is all I need.
Grant takes a seat on the floor, scooting up behind her wrapping his arms around her body. They are pressed tightly
together, gazing up at the tree.
Grant?
Yeah babe?

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
GRANT

ELIZABETH
Thank you for today. For the tree,
the decorations, the lights
...everything.
GRANT
Of course, it’s my job.
Elizabeth has her head down, looking at the make shift ring something is clearly on her mind.
ELIZABETH
(Softly.)
Sometimes I wish I could runaway
from myself.
His eyes remain looking at the tree.
GRANT
You can’t runaway from yourself.
Because then you’d be running away
from me.
She seems to be talking to herself when she asks-

Why do you love me so much?
Grant continues to look straight ahead.
GRANT

Do you remember the day after our
first date when you called to ask
me what color your eyes were?
And without hesitation I said blue.
Your eyes are blue.

I could hear you smile through the
phone. When I asked you what that
was all about you said that you’d
know when someone was really in
love with you if they could
remember the color of your eyes
after only one date.
Elizabeth tilts her head, leaning it onto Grant’s chest.

lashes out but his tone is almost always calm.

to be everywhere. There is no escaping it.
TIM (O.C.)
He doesn’t want you. He pities you.
He hates you. He thinks you’re

She turns toward the bathroom sink, opens her eyes to revealTIM standing in the bathroom behind her. Her eyes go wide
with fear. She remains perfectly still as we reveal him for
the very first time.
Tim is handsome, well tailored, pale white skin with his hair
neatly parted. He appears mannequin like. His sweater vest
and perfectly knotted tie give him a dapper appearance.
Tim is Elizabeth’s most vicious hallucination. He torments
her. He tells her horrible things and often speaks to her
like a child. She fears him but Elizabeth has been unable to
escape him. She looks right at him through the mirror.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
You’re ...not ...real.
She opens her pill case - never taking her eyes off of Tim.
She shakes a pill into her hand.
TIM
Look at yourself. Do you really
think he wants to marry you? You’re

Elizabeth is trembling. She pops the pill into her mouth, dry
swallows it and closes her eyes so hard it looks painful. She
talks to herself.

outright hateful, to screaming, to sarcasm, to moments of
what sounds like a friend consoling a loved one. It’s
unpredictable but it’s all focused on making Elizabeth feel
horrible.
TIM
How could he possibly love you?
You’re pathetic. You can’t even
take care of yourself. What’s
keeping him here? Is it your
disability check? Or maybe it’s

has ever told you the truth.
They’re all against you. The
Doctors, your Mother and even your

She closes down - her eyes begin to glaze over. A piercing
RING begins to build.

Do it. Go to the kitchen, pull out
the biggest knife you can find and
just do it. End this hurt, end
Grant’s hurt. Don’t make him suffer
anymore because of your
selfishness! Do it!
At this point Tim’s voice has faded into the RINGING.

Elizabeth’s face is staring straight ahead - the pillow held
tightly to her chest.
We hold CLOSE on her. She is overwhelmed with panic covering her ears, trying to make it all stop.

INT. DR. BOWMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

27

We are TIGHT on Elizabeth’s face - so much so we do not know
where she is. She is staring up. Her complexion pale. Her
hair tied back in a loose sloppy ponytail. She looks
despondent - disconnected.
The song, “Green” by August Roads begins to play. The CAMERA
pulls back slowly until we reveal her sitting on the couch in
Dr. Bowman’s office. She remains perfectly still - like a
mannequin.
The CAMERA moves toward her landing tight on her face where
we began, then pulls out again. It continues to do this for
the entire length of the song. Back and forth. Back and
forth. A million thoughts race through her mind - tears begin
to fill her eyes. On the final WIDE frame the song ENDS.
Dr. Bowman enters. He is holding her file.
Elizabeth wipes her eyes. He notices.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16
DR. BOWMAN
I’m sorry for the delay Elizabeth.
He takes a seat across from her.
ELIZABETH
Thank you for seeing me on such
short notice.
DR. BOWMAN
Tell me what’s going on with you.
ELIZABETH
I’m falling apart.
(She let’s out an
uncomfortable laugh.)
Emotionally, physically, mentally.
I don’t know which way to turn
anymore.
Dr. Bowman opens her file and takes out a pen.
DR. BOWMAN
What’s happened that has you so
unsettled?
She is distraught - anxious.
I saw Tim.

ELIZABETH

It’s all she can muster up. The mere mention of his name
terrifies her.
Dr. Bowman looks in her file, flips a few pages. Makes a
note.
DR. BOWMAN
From what I see here it’s been some
time since you’ve seen or heard
from that particular hallucination,
is that correct?
She nods.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
How’s your depression and anxiety
level?
ELIZABETH
Becoming more present.

DR. BOWMAN
Is there anything you’re currently
dealing with in your life that may
have triggered this recent
incident?
ELIZABETH
Not really. My fiance moved in and
I’ve been trying to plan our
wedding. But, I’m working on
getting better first. So it’s all
perfect.
She looks up at him - her face one of pure desperation and
angst.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I want it to all be perfect.
DR. BOWMAN
We’re talking about Grant, correct?
She nods. Dr. Bowman makes a note in her file.
ELIZABETH
It hasn’t been easy Dr. Bowman.
We’re dealing with all of my
issues. We’re living in a one room
apartment. Grant’s between jobs. We
can’t even afford a real ring.
She holds up her hand, revealing the tinsel make shift ring.
He looks at the ring, then to her.
DR. BOWMAN
How much do you remember about last
night?
ELIZABETH
Bits and pieces. I know it was bad.
DR. BOWMAN
Were you alone?
ELIZABETH
Grant was there.
DR. BOWMAN
Are you hallucinating now?
No.

ELIZABETH

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

DR. BOWMAN
Are you having suicidal thoughts?
No.

ELIZABETH

DR. BOWMAN
Do you think you’re a danger to
yourself?
No.

ELIZABETH

DR. BOWMAN
How about to anyone else?
ELIZABETH
No, I mean, other than driving
Grant out of his mind, I wouldn’t
say he’s in any danger.
He looks up at her - placing down the file on the coffee.
DR. BOWMAN
Elizabeth, I need you to listen to
me very carefully and try to
understand what I’m about to say,
okay?
She nods.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
The best thing you can do is ignore
the voices and hallucinations at
all costs. Don’t make friends with
them, don't talk to them, don’t
even acknowledge them. Even if
they’re nice to you.
She turns away, drifting off into thought.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
We don't want you to engage with
any of the hallucinations. It could
potentially worsen your state of
mind.
She drifts off in the distance as she listens.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
I understand how real these
hallucinations might feel when
they’re happening, but they’re not.

DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
And you need to do your best to try
and tune them out. Turn the
television up extra loud. Listen to
music with headphones on. Call
someone. Anything at all to try and
distract yourself until the episode
passes.
Elizabeth stares out the window at nothing in particular.
ELIZABETH
Do you know how scary it is when
you don’t know when life is real?
Sometimes I feel like I’m cursed.
Like I’m living in a bad dream that
I can’t wake up from. My
relationship is suffering. He says
it’s not. Grant says everything is
okay and that we’ll get through
this together but I don’t know if I
believe him. I want to.

EXT. PARK - DAY

28

Grant is jogging through a local park. The sky is cloudy. He
is deep in thought.
The scene beings to INTERCUT between Grant and Dr. Bowman’s
Office. We continue to hear Elizabeth and Dr. Bowman talk
while we stay on Grant jogging.
ELIZABETH (O.C.)
Sometimes I think it would be
better if he left me. So he could
have a real life and family and not
have to deal with me - day in and
day out.
(Beat.)
I don’t want him to stop loving me
because of this. But I don’t want
to ruin his life either.
Grant’s face is filling with emotion. It’s like he can hear
what they’re saying.
DR. BOWMAN (O.C.)
Elizabeth ...love is a very strong
emotion. It’s not something that
can be forced or created out of
thin air. Some people believe we
can even teach others to love us.

DR. BOWMAN (O.C.)
Love isn’t a dream we should be

Real love, unconditional love is
possibly our greatest achievement
as human beings. But it’s also
often the most illusive.
Grant continues to run. His pace steady and fast. His face
filling with tears.
DR. BOWMAN (O.C.) (CONT’D)
Because of that, we can often find
ourselves clinging to our idea of
love. Our perception of it.
The faster Grant runs the harder his tears fall.
As Grant picks up his pace he begins to sob uncontrollably.

smile her sadness shines through.
ELIZABETH
Thank you Dr. Bowman. I understand.
She takes a moment, thenELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I do want to get better. And stay
better and not feel afraid anymore.
DR. BOWMAN
That’s a very good start Elizabeth.
The fact that you desire to get
well means you’re a fighter and
that you’re not going to let this
illness overcome you. Life is about
choices and you have to choose for
yourself.
Elizabeth nods and smiles at Dr. Bowman.

DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
Okay lets take a look at where we
can go from here in terms of
medication and dosage.
Dr. Bowman opens her file.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
Now, I need you to be honest with
me. Are you skipping doses?
ELIZABETH
None at all.
Good.

DR. BOWMAN

Dr. Bowman looks through his files comparing medications and
dosages for a few moments.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
I’m going to prescribe a drug
called Saphris. It’s a dissolvable
tab that comes in 5 and 10
milligram doses. It can be very
effective and is generally well
tolerated.
The CAMERA stays on Elizabeth as Dr. Bowman continues to
talk. She gazes off again.
DR. BOWMAN (CONT’D)
This particular medication will not
only help you get a full nights
sleep, which could combat some of
the depression and anxiety but if
you are having an episode, similar
to the one you experienced last
night, you can place a tab under
your tongue and it can work quickly
to diminish the voices,
hallucinations and intrusive
thoughts. The main down side is it
could make you very sleepy so it’s
best to take it at night just
before bed.
ELIZABETH
It sounds too good to be true.
The CAMERA pushes closer and closer to Elizabeth. Her face,
for the first time, appears to be filled with hope.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

DR. BOWMAN
I feel good about this current
regime of medications. I want to
see you back here in a week. Keep
your head up and call the office
with any concerns or if you feel
you need to see me sooner.
ELIZABETH
(She smiles.)
Thank you Dr. Bowman.

He stands when he sees Elizabeth and walks toward her.

I thought you said you couldn't

GRANT
I thought you said it was

Elizabeth gleams with joy. They walk toward the door.
In the corner of Elizabeth’s eye she notices a BRIDAL
MAGAZINE sitting on the coffee table. She walks over and
picks it up.

Elizabeth is standing in the kitchen in front of the counter.
On the counter in front of her is the Note Pad, house keys,
Bridal Magazine and her pill case.
Next to her PILL CASE we can also see a packet of SAPHRIS.
She picks up the square plastic case the pills are enclosed
in. She mindlessly twirls it between her fingers. She takes
out a glass and fills it in the sink.
She opens her pill case, empties the daily dose into her hand
and quickly knocks them back with the glass of water. She
turns, holding the glass. Her body leaning against the sink
as she takes another swig of water.
Grant calls out.
Babe?

GRANT

(O.C.)

Elizabeth is staring at the floor, lost in thought.
Yeah.

ELIZABETH

Grant walks into the kitchen. He stands in front of her,
placing his hands on the counter on either side of her.
You okay?

GRANT

She nods as she takes another swig of water.
ELIZABETH
I just want to try and decompress a
little - read my magazine.
GRANT
(Playful.)
You mean the one you stole?
ELIZABETH
(Sarcastic.)
Shut up. I didn't steal it.

I borrowed it.
Grant smiles. He leans in - kissing her neck several times.
GRANT
Is someone getting excited about
wedding stuff?

ELIZABETH
I don’t know, maybe?
He pulls back, looking at her.
GRANT
Well I like it. It gives me hope.
How so?

ELIZABETH

GRANT
I don’t know. The kind that makes
our future look full of
experiences, full of memories...
Grant looks deep into her eyes, using his finger to push her
hair to the side - tucking it behind her ear.
GRANT (CONT’D)
Full of life.
Grant touches her lips with his index finger. He runs his
finger across her bottom lip. Elizabeth closes her eyes and
bites her lip.
GRANT (CONT’D)
I’ll see you a little later.
She open her eyes. A slight panicked tone to her voiceELIZABETH
Where are you going?
GRANT
I’m going to go for a run.
ELIZABETH
Didn’t you go on a run earlier?
He walks backwards toward the door.
GRANT
What can I say? You read Bridal
Magazines to decompress and I go
for jogs.
ELIZABETH
(Under her breath.)
Okay.
We hear the apartment door close. Elizabeth continues to
stand in the kitchen. She turns to the stove, picks up her
tea pot and fills it.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

She places the pot on the stove and turns it on. She walks
through the kitchen and into the bathroom.
The CAMERA follows her like a shadow.
37

INT. ELIZABETH’S BATHROOM - DAY

37

Elizabeth enters her bathroom, turns on the light.
The HUM of the LIGHT BULB fills the room. She gets lost for a
moment, staring at herself in the mirror. Something isn’t
right. She looks down at the floor.
From her POV - sitting on the floor beside the toilet is a
RACCOON.
She immediately looks back at herself in the bathroom mirror.
A slight smile crosses her face. She is trying to hold back
her tears. She speaks to the Raccoon (and herself) in the
mirror. Her tone soft, as if she is telling the raccoon a
secret.
ELIZABETH
I know you’re not real. I do. And I
want you to know that this will
probably be the last time I pet
you.
(She looks down at the
floor.)
You see, the doctor gave me some
new pills and I am going to try
them real soon and when I do, I
won’t see you anymore.
Elizabeth kneels down. The CAMERA pans around her. She is
making the PETTING motion but it’s clear nothing is there.
She takes a deep breath and stands - leaning her hands on the
edge of the sink, her eyes closed tight.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
There’s nothing there.
Elizabeth takes another deep breath, turns the faucet on,
bends over and splashes water on her face several times. It’s
definitely an OCD moment. After about the 5th time she stands
straight up, looking into the mirror.
The water drips from her face - she stares at herself for a
long moment before looking down at the floor again. She
doesn’t see the raccoon anymore. She reaches for a towel dries her face, softly patting it. Her hair is wet from all
the splashing.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

55.

She holds her hair high above her head, seeing how she would
look with it short. She poses several ways as she looks at
herself in the mirror. She is having a childlike good time
with herself - almost forgetting where she is.
The TEA POT screams like a siren, snapping her back to
reality. Elizabeth leaves - turning off the bathroom light.

INT. - ELIZABETH’S KITCHEN - DAY

Elizabeth shuts off the burner and moves the tea pot to a
cool burner. She walks over to the cabinet and grabs herself
a mug. She places it on the counter next to the stove and
pours her tea.
She opens the refrigerator door - her gaze becomes sharp and
steady. A calmness appears on her face.
39

INT. ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

39

Elizabeth sits down at the table.
She reaches around her head with her right hand pulling her
hair over her right shoulder, twirling it between her fingers
as she flips through her magazine.
Her expression is full of life. Her eyes expressive and
responsive to the many different dresses she could wear. Her
fingers glide over the pictures as if she were actually
touching the material of the gowns.
The CAMERA is tight on Elizabeth’s face. Her eyes are full of
daydreams. She is deep in thought.
KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
Elizabeth is startled out of her daydream. She walks toward
the door cautiously.
KNOCK! KNOCK!
ELIZABETH
Grant? Did you forget your key?
We hear a familiar voice from the other side of the door.
CAROL (O.C.)
It’s your Mother, Elizabeth. Open
the door.
ELIZABETH
One, sec...

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

56.

Elizabeth hesitates for a moment. Anxiety riddles through her
body. A visible chill causes her to tremble slightly.
Elizabeth looks down at her hands - they are shaking. She
clenches them into fists then shakes her hands and arms loose
to release some of the tension. She takes a deep breath composing herself.
She opens the door.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Mom, what are you doing here?
Standing in the doorway is Elizabeth’s MotherCAROL, in her 50’s and well put together but there is a hint
of a “past” she can’t quite shake off no matter how expensive
her outfit is. Carol immediately strolls in.
Elizabeth closes the door behind her.
CAROL
I took a ride up for the day with
your Stepfather. He had some
business. I thought I would stop by
and surprise you.
ELIZABETH
Yes, well, I’m surprised.
Carol is holding a pair of thin, black leather gloves. Her
demeanor is cold, judgemental, like a women who has been
wronged time and time again.
Elizabeth’s eyes are locked onto her Mother. Her mere
presence makes Elizabeth uptight.
As Carol enters the apartment, her trench coat seems to glide
with grace and ease behind her.
Carol looks around - her face clearly expressing disapproval
of everything she sees, including Elizabeth’s appearance.
Carol’s salon-styled hair bounces with every move she makes.
She opens her handbag placing her gloves inside before
sitting down on Elizabeth’s sofa - all in one smooth
movement. She places her bag on the floor to the right of
her. Carol leans back and crosses her legs.
The entire time Elizabeth stands there, in silence, like a
child waiting for permission to speak. If there was ever a
trigger for Elizabeth’s mental breakdowns we are witnessing
it first hand.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

57.

On the outside, Carol appears put together, confident and
determined. On the inside she is a hot bed of depression,
anxiety and sorrow but keeping up appearances is always
Carol’s number one concern. She looks at Elizabeth with a
cold, tight smile but under it all is an underlying layer of
love - deep within her.
Elizabeth is becoming increasingly nervous, anxious and
fidgety.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
So ...can I get you anything?
CAROL
No, I’m fine.
(Looking around.)
Are you ...alone?
ELIZABETH
(Defensive.)
What does that mean?
CAROL
Nothing. I was simply wondering if
anyone was “here”?
Elizabeth’s tone becomes soft but not forgiving.
No.

ELIZABETH

CAROL
What about Grant?
ELIZABETH
No, he went for a jog.
CAROL
(Awkward beat.)
Your hair got long again.
Elizabeth pulls at her hair like a child.
ELIZABETH
I know. I was actually thinking
about cutting it.
Carol looks at Elizabeth with somewhat of a heartfelt smile.
She leans forward.
CAROL
No. Don’t do that. You look so
beautiful.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

58.

Carol stands and walks toward Elizabeth. She reaches for her
daughter’s face with her hand.
Elizabeth closes her eyes and reopens them, looking at her
Mother like a little girl. For a split second she lets her
guard down, becoming vulnerable.
Hi Mommy.
Hi Lizzy.

ELIZABETH
CAROL

Elizabeth makes a face.
ELIZABETH
Mom, you know I hate it when you
call me Lizzy.
Just when we think this will be a tender moment, Carol pulls
back from Elizabeth - her tone shifting to judgemental.
CAROL
What happened to you? You look like
a corpse! Put on some damn makeup.
When are you going to get out of
this slump, stop sucking up State
disability and get back into world
for Christ sake Elizabeth?
Carol references the small desk with the books and
manuscript.
Elizabeth quickly realizes that this is the same, nasty woman
she has always known. She tenses up.
ELIZABETH
Slump? I see you’re still in denial
Mom.
Carol ignores her - glancing at the Christmas tree in the
corner of the room. She looks at it with disgust.
CAROL
A Christmas tree? We’re Jewish
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth tries very hard to stay calm. Their conversation is
filled with a lifetime of resentment and unspoken feelings.
That is about to change.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

59.

ELIZABETH
No, you’re Jewish Mom. Daddy was
Catholic and so is Grant and we
happen to like Christmas.
Carol is furious but calm.
CAROL
Don’t you dare bring up your good
for nothing Father to me. Clearly
you forgot who raised you after he
walked out on us. I guess that’s to
be expected of someone who’s too
busy playing make believe her whole
life to really know what’s going on
in the world around her.
The CAMERA starts to move around the room as they argue. The
movements are unsettling. Elizabeth does not back down. She
stares at Carol.
ELIZABETH
No Mom, I didn't forget. How could
I? You always remind me of what a
terrific single parent you were.
Tell me again how you did the best
you could with what you were given?
The back and forth arguing becomes vicious. Every word is
meant to cut deep. It’s the kind of argument that made you
want to cover your ears and hide when you were a small child
while listening to your parents fight.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
And you think that's what this is?
Make believe?
(Beat.)
I would tear off my skin if I
thought I wouldn't have to play
make believe anymore.
CAROL
(Dismissive.)
Call it what you want. I say it’s
make believe. I do and I always
thought you were full of it
Elizabeth. You always wanted
attention and this was your way of
getting it.
(She paces back and forth
like a caged rat.)
And you know something? I did do my
best.

CAROL (CONT'D)
Do you think it was easy dealing
with day to day worries after your
Father left? No job, no car, no
money...
Elizabeth raises her voice, cutting Carol off.
ELIZABETH
No man! I hate to break it to you
Mom but your “best” is the only
thing that’s make believe here.
CAROL
What does that mean?
ELIZABETH
Nothing except for the fact that
maybe you forgot to ask some
questions.
CAROL
To who, Elizabeth? You? What are
you even talking about?
ELIZABETH
Yes Mom, someone who asks their
child about what’s maybe going on
inside their head. A parental
figure would have been nice. You
know someone who worried about
their kid but what the hell would
you know about that? You were so
wrapped up in own your needs you
couldn’t be bothered by my
suffering. But then again, how
could you when all you did was coat
your own issues with pills and a
cheap bottle of chardonnay.
Elizabeth moves closer to her Mother. We’ve never seen her so
confident.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Or is it something stronger these
days? By the smell on your breath
I’d say Jack and Coke?
Carol stares at Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
What? Am I right? Am I? It’s okay,
you can tell me.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

Carol’s expression is a combination of hurt and rage. She
walks to her purse, removes a GOLD CIGARETTE CASE. She opens
it, takes out a cigarette, closes the case and taps the
cigarette on it.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Don’t smoke in my apartment.
Carol throws the case back into her purse.
CAROL
Oh, okay. And who helps pay for
this apartment?
Elizabeth hates this.
CAROL (CONT’D)
You think your disability check
covers all of your expenses?
Between this place and the extra
health insurance you need to cover
those fancy Doctor appointments,
that what, it magically pays for
itself? Hmm? And how dare you?
You’re going to point your finger
at me?
(Seething.)
Are you?
Carol’s emotions get the best of her - her voice fills with
rage with every word she utters.
CAROL (CONT’D)
You’re the reason your Father
walked out on us to begin with.
This hits Elizabeth hard but she tries not to show it.
CAROL (CONT’D)
All your neuroses and fits. Not to
mention your consistent crying like
a rotten brat! Oh how I wanted to
slap you so many times but I
didn't. I should have. Lord knows.
I know your Father wanted too. I
bet he would of beaten you within
an inch of your life if he had
stayed one more day. It might of
done you some good. Now look at
yourself. Can you see now? That’s
why Elizabeth, that’s why he left
and never looked back. You!
Elizabeth is looking down at the floor.

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

ELIZABETH
(Thoughtful beat.)
You can’t keep blaming me. Do you
think because I was only six when
he left that I don’t remember? Oh I
remember Mom.
She looks up at Carol.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I remember your mood swings and
screaming fits. I remember you
sitting at the kitchen table
smashing his watch with a hammer.
Carol is surprised that Elizabeth recalls these memories.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
I remember you tearing apart our
living room furniture in a fit of
rage. Did you forget about all
that? You must of. It’s easy to see
what you want to see but that’s why
he walked out on us.
CAROL
(Defensive.)
Keep telling yourself that
Elizabeth. You’ll start to believe
it. You always lied to make me look
like the bad person. When it was
always you just looking for
attention.
ELIZABETH
That’s right Mom. You continue to
live in that fairy tale world where
your hair doesn't move but maybe
one day you’ll wake up and realize
that blaming me was always your
answer. That way you’d never have
to take responsibility for any of
your actions.
Carol looks away. Elizabeth notices a look of dismay and
maybe an under layer of sadness.
Carol tries her hardest not to let it show. She struggles but
maintains herself and her dignity. Her voice cracks slightly
as she responds to her daughter.
Actions?

CAROL

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16
ELIZABETH
(Calm but filled with
emotion.)
Yes ...your actions. Not only with
your psychotic behavior toward
Daddy but your neglect toward me.
You think I enjoyed coming home
from school and you not being there
because you were on another date?
Constant men in and out of the
house as you took applications for
a new husband? Specifically ones
that had a checkbook to balance
your unqualified needs as a wife
and Mother.
(Beat.)
All you had to do was love me after
Daddy left. But instead you sat
high and mighty on your pedestal
looking down at me with disgust for
all my problems and mental issues.
You think they came out of nowhere
or I made them up? The truth Mom...
(She looks right at her.)
They stem from you. Not only from
the dysfunctional childhood you
gave me after Daddy walked out, on
you ...not me, but from your own
issues that you continue to ignore
and instead chose to self medicate.
But you know what? You’re not going
to make me feel bad about myself
anymore. I know I’m a mess but at
least I’m trying to fix myself. I
have an amazing Doctor and I have
Grant who is by my side and loves
me unconditionally with every break
down I have. He holds me when I’m
in pain. He comforts me when I’m
suffering. He’s all I need.
(Beat.)
There comes a time when you have to
say enough. We might be Mother and
daughter but I don’t need you to
take care of me, or be my Mother

Carol looks like she has seen a ghost. She is pale and
speechless. Her entire tone changes.

ELIZABETH
Mom, things have always been this
way between us. I love you but we
both know it.
Elizabeth points back and forth with her finger.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
This? What we have ...it’s nothing
good. It never was.
Carol stands there, unable to move or speak.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
You should go. Your new husband
needs you. Your life needs you. I
don’t need you. Or your pity. Or
your judgment. Or your money.
Carol looks at her. She knows she is right. Without another
word, she walks toward the sofa, picks up her handbag and
walks to the door.
She stands there for a moment, waiting for Elizabeth to say
something. Without looking back Carol opens the door, exits
and closes it softly behind her - she is gone.
Elizabeth walks over to the sofa and sits down. She places
her elbows on her knees, her head down, her face covered with
her hands.
Elizabeth leans back on the sofa, grabs a throw pillow and
places it on her lap. She play’s with the zipper on the
pillow absentmindedly. She looks straight ahead at nothing in
particular. She closes her eyes. We hold on her face.
Times SPEEDS ups. The SUN goes down, the apartment grows
dark. We come back to normal time and speed. Elizabeth opens
her eyes.
Grant walks in. Elizabeth reaches over and turns on the lamp.
Hey.

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)

Grant sits on the couch beside her.
Hey.

ELIZABETH
We said what we had to say. Where

GRANT
I lost track of time, who cares.
Elizabeth, tell me what happened?
ELIZABETH
It’s over Grant. It’s been over for
a long time. I put the last nail in
the coffin and said everything I
needed to say. So did she.
(Beat.)
I feel like I got closure, real
closure. Going all the way back to
when I was a kid. Is that possible?
GRANT
(Thoughtful beat.)
Sometimes we hold onto things we
know aren’t good for us because
we’re afraid of what will happen if
we let go. But when we finally do
it’s like a weight off our chest
and then we’re truly free. It’s a
good thing. Trust me.

scene.

over the years but never fully
understood what she was doing. It
was always about her. Now it has to
be about me.

About us.
He leans into her - kissing her.
GRANT
You’re amazing.
ELIZABETH
(Playful yet honest.)
You smell.
He pulls away, smells his armpit.
GRANT
I’m gonna take a shower.
He gets up, starts walking backwards. He takes off his shirt throwing at her. His chest and arms are covered with several
TATTOOS.

Elizabeth smiles.
ELIZABETH

Why Mr. O’Neil, what kind of girl

GRANT
A naughty one, I hope. See you in

Grant walks out our frame leaving Elizabeth on the couch with
a huge grin on her face. It’s the first time we’ve seen her
smile like this.
A moment later she springs from the sofa toward the bathroom.

Elizabeth enters the shop. The store is small yet warm and

all in.
The shop is elegant with vintage touches, from a beautiful
old chandelier, hand painted walls and mahogany cabinets,
which bring warmth to the built in closet lined with wedding
dresses held perfectly in place by feminine, white padded
hangers.
Several glass counter tops encase antique wedding
accessories. Elizabeth feels like she has stepped into a
dream. Her face beaming. She lets her hand drift across a row
of dresses asHello.

Elizabeth turns, revealingJANE (35), slender, beautiful and classy wearing a little

No, just me. I sent my fiance away.
He’ll be back in an hour to pick me

JANE
Wonderful. That’s plenty of time.
And it’s always better when the man

Elizabeth smiles.

Jane gives her a warm smile.

Jane goes back into the store. Elizabeth turns toward Grant,
gives him a shrug.
Jane comes back to the door. She is holding a piece of paper
that appears to be torn from a notebook.

Now I don’t want to be presumptuous
but if you haven’t decided on who

PIERCING sound. Elizabeth reaches into her purse, takes out a
pill, pops it into her mouth and swallows.

That’s good news. That tells me the
Invega is working. How’s your
anxiety been?

Comes and goes. I had a pretty bad
argument with my Mother the other

things to each other.

Don’t be. I think it helped me get

So other than the raccoon and some

No. And things with Grant have been
much better. That feeling I was
having about him leaving me passed.
DR. BOWMAN
That’s good. And have you been
taking the Saphris?
ELIZABETH
No, not yet. I haven’t felt like I
needed too. Like you said, I guess
the Invega must be working.

I’m sure that it is but I’d like
you to take a Saphris tonight. 10
milligrams.

10? But I thought you said that was
for extreme circumstances.

That’s correct but it’s also
preventative. Considering the
occurrence with Tim was fairly
recent followed by the argument
with your Mother, I’d rather be
safe than sorry. These types of
situations can often cause a
relapse due to stress. Why not nip
it in the bud now?

She tears the tin silver covered pill from the pack and opens
it. The pill is white, flat and chalky in appearance.
And with that, she places the tab under her tongue. We hold
on her face. She makes a contorted face while the pill
dissolves. She shakes both her hands in a fast yet steady
pace as if that will somehow make the pill go down easier.
It’s finally dissolved. She rinses her mouth out under the
faucet and looks at the White Plastic sleeve the pills came

Sitting on a SINGLE BED on top of a WHITE BLANKET are the
Bridal Magazine and Notebook Elizabeth has been using but
unlike in the previous times we have seen them they now
appear worn - tattered even, as if they have been used over
and over again for a long period of time.
Her hands comes into frame, scooping them up.

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

65

We PAN around the room revealing the lay out for the first
time. We can’t help but notice an eerie familiarity about it.
-The couch to the left.
-A coffee table in front of it.
-Windows covered by wooden blinds.
-A round two-seater table with two chairs.
-In the corner - a Fake Christmas tree with nothing but
silver tinsel on it. The same kind of tinsel Elizabeth used
to make her ring.
-A built in TV cabinet on the other wall. Just like in the
opening scene - STATIC is the only thing playing on the TV.
We stay on the TV for a moment, thenElizabeth walks into room and sits on the couch. She is
wearing sweat pants, a baggy sweatshirt and those thick
hospital socks from the opening scene - her hair sloppily
tied back.
The Note book and Bridal Magazine rest on the couch beside
her. Elizabeth stares straight ahead. Her eyes glazed over.
An odd, distant look planted on her face.
We stay in a WIDE SHOT as we begin to hear the following
conversation between Dr. Bowman and Elizabeth’s Mother,
Carol.
CAROL (V.O.)
I thought you said she was making
progress?

DR. BOWMAN (V.O.)
She is. But the type of
Schizophrenia Elizabeth has is very
uncommon and can manifest symptoms
in many ways, including a change in
her perceptions that can influence
her sense of reality. In her
particular case this not only
includes hearing voices that are
not real or seeing something that
is not actually present, she also
has tactile hallucinations that
create a sensation of physical
contact. In addition she has the
type of anxiety symptoms which are
consistent with a diagnosis of OCD.
All of these symptoms at once can
lead to severe distress and be very
disabling. With all of these
medical conditions to manage, it’s
going to be very challenging and
extremely important to have an
effective treatment plan and to
stick with it.

INT. DR. BOWMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

66

Carol and Dr. Bowman are mid-conversation. The CAMERA cuts
back and forth between them - remaining TIGHT on their faces,
almost filling the entire screen.
You can tell by the look on Carol’s face that either she
didn’t understand a word he just said or doesn’t want to
accept it.
CAROL
What does that even mean?
DR. BOWMAN
Mrs. O’Neil, you...
CAROL
(She interrupts him.)
O’Neil was her Father’s name. I’m
remarried now. Please, call me
Carol.
DR. BOWMAN
Of course.
(Clearing his throat.)
Carol, your daughter’s mental
health is, well, severe in nature.

DR. BOWMAN (CONT'D)
Stress, let alone a traumatic event
can easily trigger a psychotic
episode.
CAROL
I’m sorry Dr. Bowman but I just
don’t understand any of this.
DR. BOWMAN
The first appearance of the
hallucination Elizabeth came to
identify as Grant seems to have
coincided with the death of her
Father last year. So although the
medication did in fact eliminate
her hallucinations, including the
one of Grant, it uncovered a deeper
emotional and psychological
detachment.
Carol appears to drift off in thought for a moment.
CAROL
(Deep sigh.)
Did Elizabeth mention that she and
her Father had started speaking
again just before he died?
DR. BOWMAN
No, she hadn’t mentioned that.
Carol let’s out a sad, reflective laugh.
CAROL
They were very close before we
split up. Every Sunday they would
order Chinese food and watch movies
all damn day. They’d laugh and he’d
tell her stories. It was their
special time together.
(Beat, soft.)
He’d even tell her that some day a
wonderful guy, like some knight in
shining armor would come along and
marry her and she would say...
Carol chokes up. She composes herself.
CAROL (CONT’D)
...She would say, I hope I meet a
great guy just like you Daddy.
(Beat.)
He called her his little “Lizzy
Blue”.

Dr. Bowman can see the pain in her face.
DR. BOWMAN
I’m sorry Carol.
Now what?

CAROL

DR. BOWMAN
Dr. Sanders and I have decided it
would be best to keep her here at
Statewood. Hopefully, after some
time and the proper treatment
Elizabeth will be able to break
free from the notion that she’s
lost the love of her life.
Carol takes a long, thoughtful beat before looking directly
at Dr. Bowman.
CAROL
Is this my fault?
We CUT TO a WIDE TWO SHOT of Carol and Dr. Bowman sitting
across from one another. They hold their gaze. No words are
spoken.

INT. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WARD COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

67

Elizabeth remains on the couch in a complete daze. A moment
later, a NURSE walks in. We can only see her from about the
waist down.
JANE (O.C.)
Hi Elizabeth, how are you feeling
today sweetie? Can I get you
anything? Maybe a cup of water?
No response. The Nurse turns toward the TV and notices the
static. For the first time we reveal her face and her name
tag. It’s Jane from the Bridal shop, only it’s actually Nurse
Jane.
A sad smile crosses Jane’s face as she looks at the static
then back to Elizabeth, who is completely checked out.
She walks toward the TV. Just as she does, the HEAD NURSE
walks in.
HEAD NURSE
What are you doing?

V12_THE SHOOTING SCRIPT_7/2/16

90.

JANE
Nothing, I was going to put
something on the TV for Elizabeth.
Jane turns to Elizabeth.
JANE (CONT’D)
Would you like to watch anything in
particular?
The Head Nurse turns to Jane. Soft but firmHEAD NURSE
You can put anything you want on
that TV or just turn it off all
together. It won’t make a
difference either way. All she ever
does is sit there, write in that
notebook and flip through that
bridal magazine.
(Beat. She takes a step
toward her.)
Listen, I know you’re new here but
you can’t give too much to the
patients. You won’t survive the
job. Now I need you to start
prepping the evening medications.
Rounds start in 30 minutes.
Jane understands. She nods. The Head Nurse leaves. Jane gives
one more, heartfelt look to Elizabeth, turns the channel and
leaves the room.
On the TV, the song,“SOMEBODY’S GETTING MARRIED” from The
Muppets Take Manhattan begins to play. We hold on the TV for
a few beats before turning to a WIDE SHOT of Elizabeth
sitting on the couch.
The CAMERA begins a slow PUSH IN toward Elizabeth. We are
getting closer and closer to Elizabeth’s face as the song
continues to play. Her eyes appear to be ever-so-slightly
tearing up but we can’t tell if it’s happiness or sadness.
The CAMERA continues to move toward her. The song builds to a
crescendo.
We are now TIGHT on Elizabeth’s face. We hear Elizabeth’s
voice from an earlier conversation with Dr. BowmanELIZABETH (V.O.)
Do you know how scary it is when
you don’t know when life is real?
Sometimes I feel like I’m cursed.

ELIZABETH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Like I’m living in a bad dream that
I can’t wake up from. My
relationship is suffering from
this. He says it’s not. Grant says
everything is okay and that we’ll
get through this together. I don’t
know if I believe him. I want to.
Elizabeth closes her eyes so tight it looks painful.

CLOSE ON GRANT’S FACE:

He is looking directly into the camera - into Elizabeth’s
eyes - as if he were standing right in front of her.
GRANT
I love you Elizabeth Blue.
69

CLOSE ON ELIZABETH’S FACE:

Elizabeth’s eyes open. We are so TIGHT that her blue eyes
fill the entire screen. We hold for a moment.
CUT TO: BLACK
The End!
