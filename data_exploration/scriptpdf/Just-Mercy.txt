JUNE 7, 1987

3 SHOTS -- LOOKING UP AT a grove of pine trees, leaves
and limbs swaying in the breeze, backdropped by the
Alabama sky.
A lead weight tied to the end of a cord FLOATS into the
air, wraps around a high limb.
REVEAL: WALTER “JOHNNY D” McMILLIAN (40s, black) as he
PULLS on the cord to lift the rope up to the top of the
tree.
CLOSEUP ON THE ROPE
as he expertly ties a bowline knot and PULLS it up to the
treetop.
He hands the excess rope to his EMPLOYEE (30s, black).
WALTER
Let’s lay it down right here.
He looks up at the tree once more, respectfully.

Then --

CLOSEUP - A CHAINSAW
cuts a notch into the side he wants the tree to fall.
Then he SAWS through from the other side.
The tree falls, CRASHING to the ground.
Walter CLICKS off his saw and looks up, taking a moment
to watch the trees dance in the wind. He takes a DEEP
BREATH -- at peace. Then looks over to his employee -WALTER
Alright, let’s chop and load!

ripples through him as -SHERIFF TATE (late 30s, white) approaches the truck,
unsettling ease in his step.
Walter shows both hands as Tate reaches the window.
WALTER

Oh, no, that won’t be necessary.

INT. GEORGIA STATE PRISON - VISITATION ROOM - DAY

Framed through the Plexiglas of a metal door, BRYAN
STEVENSON (early-20s), eyes that never stop thinking,
stands nervously in an old suit as a GUARD opens the
door.
He hesitates before entering the 20-foot room, stools
bolted to the floor, metal mesh for walls. It’s obvious
he’s not used to being in a place like this. As the door
SLAMS behind -7

INT. GEORGIA STATE PRISON - VISITATION ROOM - DAY (TWENTY
MINUTES LATER)
Bryan sits, staring at a used notebook, WHISPERING his
introduction to himself, preparing for what’s ahead.
Then -- chains CLANGING from outside the door, the
HAUNTING SOUND increases with his anxiety until -CLANK! The door opens and a GUARD walks in with the
prisoner, HENRY DAVIS. He looks about Bryan’s age,
black, and just as worried as he is. As Bryan looks at
him, he averts his gaze.
As the Guard UNLOCKS his chains, Bryan notices how
weighed down Henry is -- handcuffs on his wrists, chain
around his waist, shackles on his ankles.
Taking off the last shackle, the Guard looks up at Bryan.
GUARD
You got one hour.
The door CLANGS shut behind the Guard.

Something wrong with my case?

The Southern Prisoners Defense
Committee sent me to tell you that
they don’t have a lawyer for you
yet, but they hope to soon.
HENRY

You not a lawyer?
BRYAN
Uh, no... I’m still in school, I’m
just interning here for the
summer.
Henry doesn’t hide his disappointment.
HENRY
So, you can’t tell me nothin’
about my case?
BRYAN
Oh, um. I am supposed to tell you
that... you’re not at risk of
execution any time in the next
year.
Henry stares. Bryan can’t read his expression. Henry
puts his head down, lets out a long EXHALE, speaks
without looking up -HENRY
Can you say that again?
BRYAN
(hesitant)
You’re not at risk of execution
any time in the next year.
Henry takes a BREATH, slowly nods to himself. When he
finally looks up, he has tears in his eyes as he holds
his hand out.

Thank you.

that yet.

Honestly, this internship has been
my best experience so far.

somber.
HENRY

That’s the hardest part, knowin’
all the shit I put her through.
Before Bryan can respond -- CLANK. The Guard opens the
door, angry. He strides up to Henry, roughly CUFFS his
wrists behind his back.

anything!

You need to shut your mouth.

It’s okay, Bryan.

Don’t worry ‘bout me. Just come
back.
The officer tries to push him out, but Henry plants his
feet, leans back, strong and dignified. He closes his
eyes and begins to SING, his baritone voice strong and
clear.
HENRY
I’m pressing on, the upward way,/
New heights I’m gaining, every
day -The Guard stops pushing for a moment, thrown off by the
song.
HENRY
Still praying as, I’m onward
bound,/Lord, plant my feet on

FIND Bryan, one of FOUR STUDENTS OF COLOR in a class of

PROFESSOR BARTHOLET
In the 1972 Furman v. Georgia
decision, the Supreme Court
strikes down the death penalty
because of widespread racial bias.
Four years later, the Court
upholds a new death penalty scheme
in Gregg, unwilling to presume
racial discrimination without
evidence. This year, Warren
McCleskey’s lawyers presented
evidence that the new death
penalty is as racially biased as
the old one. But they lose. Why?
A LAW STUDENT (20s, white), entitled, doesn’t raise his
hand -LAW STUDENT
McCleskey didn’t get the death
penalty because he was black, he
got it because he killed a cop in
cold blood.
Bryan exchanges a look with another BLACK STUDENT,
they’re used to this clown. Professor Bartholet can see
Bryan’s wheels turning.

BRYAN
The Baldus study they presented
proved that in Georgia, you’re 11
times more likely to get the death
penalty if the victim is white
than if the victim is black, 22
times more likely if the defendant
is black and the victim is white.
Every way you look at it, race is
the greatest predictor of who gets
the death penalty.
LAW STUDENT
The reliability of that study is
debatable.
Bryan glances at the Law Student, used to this type of
classmate over the years. He doesn’t hold back -BRYAN
Over 2000 murder cases subjected
to 230 nonracial variables. It
was reliable enough for the
Supreme Court to accept.
LAW STUDENT
But they still rejected the
argument.
BRYAN
Because they were afraid of trying
to fix something they believed was
unfixable. And they were wrong.
(beat)
In his dissent, Justice Brennan
ridiculed the ruling as ‘a fear of
too much justice.’
LAW STUDENT
I think they’re just being
realistic. A certain amount of
bias in our judicial system is
inevitable. It’s just a hard
truth we have to learn to live
with.
This triggers a fire in Bryan unseen before.

BRYAN
I grew up in a racially segregated
community in Delaware, where black
kids weren’t allowed to go to
public school. But in Brown vs.
Board of Education, the court
didn’t say segregation was
inevitable, they said it was
unconstitutional. They forced the
country to open up the schools,
and that’s the only reason I’m in
this classroom. That’s what the
law can do when it’s used for
justice.
(beat)
As long as the death penalty is
administered on the basis of race
or class, it’s as big a stain on
our country as segregation or
slavery. And I don’t think it’s
naive to believe we can do
something to change it.
LAW STUDENT
Well, five Justices of the Supreme
Court would disagree with you
there.

odds.

Legal assistance is one thing,
tryin’ to put convicted murderers
back on the street is somethin’
else entirely.
A charged beat, sizing each other up until, Tommy
smiles -TOMMY
But I’m sure you didn’t come all
the way down here to talk about
that. What can I do for you
today, Bryan?
Bryan reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a file of
transcripts, with portions highlighted.
BRYAN
I’d like to talk about Johnny D
McMillian.
TOMMY
You know I wasn’t part of his
prosecution, right? That was
before my time.
BRYAN
That’s why I wanted to meet you...
I’ve read through the record a few
times now, and I have some serious
doubts about the reliability of
his conviction.

If you could take a look at the
sections I highlighted, you’ll see
some obvious problems with Ralph
Myers’ testimony.
A beat, as Tommy flips through the pages.
TOMMY
This was one of the most
outrageous crimes in Monroe County
history, and your client made a
lot of people here very angry.
BRYAN
I understand that, but there are
some serious problems with this

Tommy closes the transcripts and PLOPS them on the desk.
TOMMY
But I already know what happened.
Johnny D McMillian was convicted
by a jury of brutally murdering a
teenage girl in my community. And
it’s my job to defend the
integrity of that conviction.
Bryan sits back, was hoping for a different response.
BRYAN
Even if it was based on false
testimony?
TOMMY
You’re the only one I know who
thinks that.
BRYAN
Then I must be the only one who
read the record because it’s
pretty obvious.
Tommy stares at him, doesn’t like the implication.
TOMMY
That man caused a lot of pain for
folks ‘round here, and if you
start diggin’ in those wounds,
you’re gonna be makin’ a lot of
people very unhappy.
Bryan hesitates -- is that a threat?

He recovers --

BRYAN
My job isn’t to make people happy,
it’s to achieve justice for my
client.
Tommy smiles, reaches for a file and hands it to him.
TOMMY

Bryan knows how important this moment is. Takes a sip of
his sweet tea to calm himself, looks out at the now
silent sea of faces staring at him.

refills it to the brim. Bryan smiles, CLEARS his throat.

Johnny D was with us, mornin’ to

his dad’s injustice, standing beside a 40-year-old
mechanic, JIMMY, and DARNELL HOUSTON (20s), nervous, with
a Jheri curl.

People started talkin’, and the
stories kept growin’. He went
from a cheat to a drug dealer to
the head of the Dixie Mafia. So
when someone finally called him a
killer, nobody thought twice.
UNCLE LEO (70s), confined to a wheelchair but with the
voice of a leader, speaks up.

They can call it what they want,
but we all know this is just

worried, too. You really love
him. And I don’t take that

EVA
When you asked me to do this with

have people talkin’ shit behind my
back, or to my face. And I was
fine with that. Don’t need anyone
to like me long as I’m doin’ what
I’m supposed to. But threatenin’

The State’s case against Walter
McMillian turned entirely on the

was no other evidence to establish
Mr. McMillian’s guilt. No
physical evidence linking him to
the crime, no motive, no
witnesses. Only the word of one
man.

Foster, sitting at the bench, continues reading his

Ralph Myers took the stand before
this court, swore to tell the
truth, and proceeded to recant
most, if not all, of the relevant
portions of his testimony at
trial. Clearly, he has either
perjured himself at trial or in
front of this court.

After careful review, it is this
court’s opinion that conclusive
evidence has not been provided
that Ralph Myers perjured himself
at the original trial, and that

It’s easy to see this case as one
man trying to prove his innocence.
But when you put a black man on
death row for a year before his
trial, and exclude black people
from serving on his jury... When
you base your conviction on the
coerced testimony of a white felon
and ignore the testimonies of two
dozen law-abiding black
witnesses... When any evidence
proving his innocence is
suppressed, and anyone who tries
to tell the truth is threatened,
this case becomes more than the
trial of a single defendant, it
becomes a test of whether we’re
going to be governed by fear and
anger or by the rule of law.

This man has taught me a lot in

out of law school with grand ideas
in my mind about how to change the

with people who were wrongly
convicted; children who were sent
to adult prisons where they were
raped and abused; people with
mental and physical disabilities
who were thrown into cells when
they should be in hospitals;
vulnerable people calling me every
day, begging for help. Sometimes
the problem seemed so big, I felt
like a fool for thinking I could
do anything to fix it.

This man taught me how to stay

hopelessness is the enemy of

distorted by the people in power.
It allows us to stand up when they
tell us to sit down, and to speak
when they say be quiet.

Through this work, I’ve learned
that each of us is more than the
worst thing we’ve ever done; that
the opposite of poverty isn’t
wealth, the opposite of poverty is
justice; that the character of our
nation isn’t reflected in how we
treat the rich and privileged, but
how we treat the poor, the
disfavored and condemned.
(beat)
Our system has taken more from
this innocent man than it has the
power to give back. But I believe
if each of us can follow his lead,
we can begin to change this world
for the better. If we can look at
ourselves closely, and honestly, I
believe we will see that we all
need justice, we all need mercy
and perhaps, we all need some
measure of unmerited grace.
