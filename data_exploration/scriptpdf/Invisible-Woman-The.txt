A school hallOn a raised stage, a YOUNG SCHOOL BOY in fake
moustache dressed as a waiter, stands in waiting. Two
more SCHOOLBOYS, dressed in climbing costumes, sit at
a cafe table close by. A back cloth of the Swiss Alps
strung up behind. A young male teacher MR LAMBOURNE
[late 20’s] hovers distracted, clearly trying to
organise an errant backstage.
In the wings just visible, PROP MAKERS and STAGE MANAGERS
adjust collars on SCHOOLBOY ACTORS; An angelic LION [6 yrs]
waits with OTHERS, bored and tired in floormop wig and
painted nose, yawning as he peeks out to the auditorium
beyond to seeREVEREND WILLIAM BENHAM [mid 50’s] sits, silently waiting,
in the makeshift stalls, reading through a playscript
entitledNo Thoroughfare: A Drama in Five Acts by Charles Dickens
and Wilkie Collins.
Beyond a small orchestra of SCHOOLBOYS just visible in a
makeshift orchestra pit; a JOLLY SCHOOLBOY PERCUSSIONIST
tightens a nut on a wide drum. A TEENAGE VIOLINIST waxes
the strings on a viola, a SCHOOLBOY OBOIST and PIANIST
quietly tune up, looking to the clock overhead.

husband, just visible escorting a PORTLY PARENT along a
distant corridor.
GEORGE
Here is the theatre. The boys
always perform a short play at the
end of term, highly popular with
the parents. Theatre is an abiding
interest of my wife’s. Which of
course I delight in!
He smiles at BENHAM, a shared look of quizzical concern, a
clock ticking overhead.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Is she still not here?
BENHAM shrugs, smiles benignly.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Mr and Mrs Featherstone may I
introduce Mr Benham. Mr Benham is
invaluable to the school. He
assists my wife with penny readings
and other charitable events. You
will often find them in corners
plotting their next money raising
venture.

help themselves.

By ‘those’ he meant the many fallen
women that we see around us every
day and their offspring, many who
rely on this hospital today. I

The two grim nurses, poverty and
sickness bring these children
before you and preside over their
births, rock their wretched
cradles, nail down their little
coffins, pile up the earth above
their graves. Their unnatural
deaths form one third of the annual
deaths in this great town. “But
what of God?” He piously replied.

it too brutal. So instead Pip

NELLY laughs, the moment broken, hurriedly buries her tear

A row of SCHOOLBOYS, GEOFFREY at its heart bowing before a
delighted audience.
ALL
Bravo..Bravo.
NELLY flushed and happy, eyes stung with tears of pride,

Bravo.
NELLY turns to GEORGE, gripping his hand. GEORGE squeezes it,

smiling at GEOFFREY a mop of golden curls.
