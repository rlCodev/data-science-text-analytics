Sweeping aerial shot of London, establishing the city in all
its glory.

EXT. SOUTHWARK BRIDGE. DAY.

We swoop down the Thames to find a svelte figure on the
bridge hailing a taxi.

INT. CHURCH. DAY

2

SHAZZER, early forties, and her folk singer husband FERGUS,
scurry down the aisle.
The church is packed with people we might recognise. A few
literary and TV celebrities amongst them. Shazzer spots JUDE,
now a pillar of married respectability, her husband GILES and
their tiny baby. They take the seats beside them.

INT. CHURCH. DAY.

BRIDGET JONES enters the church. She’s older than when we
last saw her, forty three to be exact, slim and elegantly
dressed. She takes a deep breath and collects herself.
Bridget spots Jude and Shazzer and heads towards them.
Shazzer greets her with a big hug.
SHAZZER
How are you feeling, you OK?
BRIDGET
Yes, but I still can’t believe he’s
gone.
REVEAL - at the front a portrait of DANIEL CLEAVER.
ANOTHER REVEAL - The congregation consists mainly of
ludicrously attractive, glamorous women, all weeping.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
His death seems to have hit the
Eastern European teenage modelling
community particularly hard.
JUDE
They found the flight recorder but
still no bodies.
SHAZZER
Yep, in the Australian outback. And
strangely fitting that he died
going down in the bush.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

A random guy, JOHN, takes his place next to Bridget. A hush
descends and the service begins.
A dour looking Minister assumes the pulpit.
MINISTER
Dear friends, we are gathered here
to celebrate the life of Daniel
Vivian Cleaver. Daniel was a kind
and wonderful son, a loving Uncle
and brother, a fantastic friend...
SHAZZER
(aside to Bridget)
A selfish but gifted lover?
Bridget gives a little smile, but then stops in her tracks.
BRIDGET
Fuck. What the fuck is he doing
here?
We see MARK DARCY enter at the back of the church. A little
older, a little greyer, but still just as handsome.
As Bridget takes this surprise in, she sees an attractive
woman, CAMILLA take his arm.
JUDE
You know what he’s like, wanting to
do the decent thing.
SHAZZER
Is that his wife?
Bridget nods.
JUDE
She’s pretty.
BRIDGET
I mean, yes, conventionally, I
suppose.
SUDDENLY DARCY LOOKS OVER.
Bridget, aware of Darcy’s gaze, grabs onto random John’s arm.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
(whispers)
Sorry, I’m just very emotional.
Darcy looks over, she pretends not to see and affectionately
brushes the fluff from a bewildered John’s shoulder.
Darcy faintly but discernibly registers this.
John tries to shake himself free. Bridget struggles to cling
on to his arm but John uncouples himself, and Bridget is left
solo. Darcy glances over.

MINISTER
I would now like to invite his
loved ones up to share some of
their memories of Daniel.
Shazzer gives Bridget a nudge, as if to say go on. Bridget
contemplates the idea as a glamorous young woman gets up from
the front pew.
BRIDGET
(whispers to Jude)
You know he could be very
sensitive, he could make you feel
like you were the only woman in the
world. I remember when he took me
rowing on the Serpentine and quoted
Keats by heart. “Where be ye going,
you Devon Maid? And what have ye
there in the basket?”
Bridget drifts off in fond reverie. The glamorous young woman
stands in the pulpit.
GLAMOROUS YOUNG WOMAN
...“Ye tight little fairy just
fresh from the dairy, Will ye give
me some cream if I ask it?”
In the front pew several more young women look at each other
awkwardly, clearly sharing exactly the same memory.
Bridget, Shazzer and Jude all laugh, they can’t help
themselves. The rest of the congregation look at them
disapprovingly.
Mark and Bridget make fleeting, but definite eye contact, as
he catches her mid gorgeous, life-affirming laugh.
Bridget then looks sadly at the portrait of Daniel at the
front.
MINISTER
Would anybody else like to say a
few words?
No one else in the congregation stands up. After a nudge from
Shazzer, Bridget gets up.
BRIDGET
Daniel was a man who touched many
of us, here today, including me.
There is a small, slightly awkward pause, but she continues
unabated.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Right now, if Daniel were here, he
would have told me to ‘Shut up,
Jones’ and he would’ve been right.
All I really need to say is, I miss
you, dear Daniel. We all do. Thank
you.

INT. CHURCH. DAY. LATER.

4A

The congregation is leaving. At the back of the church
Bridget says goodbye to her friends. As she turns, she finds
herself face to face with Mark Darcy and his wife.
MARK
Bridget.
BRIDGET
Mark.
MARK
Camilla, my wife. Bridget Jones,
my.....an old friend.
BRIDGET
Less old....more childhood.
BRIDGET/CAMILLA
Hello. Hello.
Awkward pauses all round.
BRIDGET
Nice memorial.....as memorials go.
Almost makes one look forward to
one’s own.
Camilla just stares at Bridget strangely.
MARK
Right. Yes. Well. Goodbye.
BRIDGET
Yes. Goodbye.
They part in opposite ways. At the last moment, Mark looks
back.
CUT TO:
AMY WINEHOUSE’S ‘MY TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN’ kicks in.

EXT. SOUTHWARK BRIDGE AND SOUTH LONDON STREETS. DAY

6

Bridget walks across the familiar bridge.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
Here I am Bridget Jones, one day
short of 43. Of the two loves of my
life: one is dead and the other is
married.
She walks on...

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

5

BRIDGET (V.O.)
Still, not to dwell on the
negatives. Many positives to note.
Am down to ideal weight! Am 685
days without a single cigarette. Am
hitting government target for
recommended intake of alcohol. 2-3
units per day.
A good looking man clocks her and takes her in as she walks she smiles to herself once he has passed.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
Have top job as producer of award
winning intelligent persons news
programme.
Bridget walks through the now fashionable Borough Market. She
passes the smallest Italian restaurant in the world, and
waves at GIANNI, the owner.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
AND...have foot on London’s
property ladder in now-fashionable
Borough Market...
7

EXT./INT. BRIDGET’S FLAT. CONTINUOUS

7

She trips up over a brand new, unused bicycle in the hallway.
Looks at it guiltily. She enters her sitting room just as a
fast train bullets past the windows, shaking the walls.
BRIDGET(V.O.)
...cleverly acquired just before
the new-improved transport links.
And even though I am still single,
I have NOT acquired a cat.
Then she opens a ‘funny’ birthday card featuring an old lady
and a cat.
She enters her make-shift office and goes to the shelf where
her old diaries are. She rifles through them to find a
photograph of her and Daniel, which is placed between the
pages. She looks at it mournfully before her eyes settle on
the diary entry on the page behind the photo... “Reasons why
Mark Darcy and I could never work” followed by a list of
reasons.
8

INT. BEDROOM. BRIDGET’S FLAT. NIGHT

8

Bridget lies in her bed.
On one bedside table is a pile of serious political tomes and
on the other, some self-help books. “Spinsterhood is the new
Feminism”, “Jog yourself Happy”, A 5:2 diet book with an
empty Kit-Kat wrapper on top, and on the floor in a pile of
dirty clothes “The Life Changing Powers of Tidying” She opts
for none of these, and picks up her iPad with a red cover and
types.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

6

BRIDGET (V.O.)
If today has taught me anything,
it’s that life is short, you’ve got
to seize the day, stop making the
same mistakes, stop looking back
and... and not be dissuaded by the
very simple fact that the future,
seems to be somethingSuddenly the screen goes black. Bridget drags a charger and a
stray bra tangled in the wires across the floor. Plugs it in.
She then tries to get back in bed with the iPad, but realizes
the lead is just too short to reach.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
...that happens to everyone else
whilst I am still scrabbling around
for an iPad charger.
She attempts to lean out of her bed and continue to type, but
realizes it’s too awkward and uncomfortable.
BRIDGET
(randomly)
I mean, it’s not like we even had
that much in common when it came
down to it.
She gives up and switches off her light.

INT. BRIDGET’S FLAT. EARLY NEXT MORNING.

In the near darkness. Bridget’s phone rings loudly. She bolts
up out of bed.
MUM (O.S.)
Hello darling, it’s Mummy. Just
wanted to wish you a happy
birthday.
Bridget fishes around for the TV remote control and flicks on
breakfast TV - a clock on the corner of the TV screen.
BRIDGET
Mum, it’s 6.00am!
Bridget studies her phone curiously.
MUM (V.O)
I’m doing The Facetime, Una taught
me, it’s really marvellous.
CLOSE-UP - Bridget’s phone - there is an extreme close-up of
MUM’S EAR.
BRIDGET
The point of Facetime is that you
don’t have to hold it to your ear.
Mum removes it from her ear, the camera swings round to
reveal Dad sitting on the loo, oblivious.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

MUM (O.S.)
This time forty three years ago I
was having a lamb Biryani in an
attempt to coax you out.
Twenty-three hours of labour. I was
never the same again down there,
but I’ve hardly ever regretted it.
Bridget half listening. An Ad for an internet dating site
called Qwantify just audible: happy cartoon couples meet and
kiss, voiced by real couples who’ve found love on the net.
MUM (CONT’D)
It’s a miracle, the gift of
childbirth. Penny HusbandsBosworth’s son sells his sperm on
the internet. You don’t even need a
man, Bridget.
10

INT. MUM’S BEDROOM. SAME TIME.
We see there are flyers with Mum’s face on them lying on a
bedroom table.
MUM (CONT’D)
And some people have marvellous
lives without them. I mean, look at
you! You’ve got a nice flat, a
great career, a nice flat...
BRIDGET (O.S)
I’m putting the phone down now Mum.
DAD emerges from the bathroom.
MUM
(holding up phone to Dad)
Say Happy Birthday to Bridget.
Dad hurriedly covers his naked torso.
DAD
Happy Birthday to Bridget.
MUM
I love you darling. Don’t forget
I’m counting on you to head up my
media campaign.
BRIDGET
Mum, it’s the Parish Council
election, not the U.S. Primaries.
Bridget hangs up.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
At least no one at work knows it’s
my birthday.

EXT/INT. HARD NEWS TV STUDIOS. DAY.

11

Bridget strides into the studio, ready for the day.
EVERYONE
SURPRISE!!
Bridget’s face falls as she sees her office is filled with
people. A PA holds up a card which says ‘43 TODAY’ in huge
letters. Someone else holds out a toy tombstone that says
‘Bridget Jones 1973-2016’.
BRIDGET
Oh God, oh God. Who told you?
MIRANDA, a gorgeous, thirty-something friend of Bridget’s and
presenter of the show, steps forward and takes a selfie with
her.
MIRANDA
Guilty. Thought it would cheer you
up. Hashtag ‘Bridge’s bday’.
Bridget looks horrified as SUSAN the pregnant Floor Manager
brings up a cake emblazoned with forty three candles for her
to blow out.
SUSAN
So hot... so many candles.
They start to sing ‘Happy 43rd Birthday to you’ as the Floor
Manager continues to hold the cake up.
Then mid-song the fire alarm starts to go off and then the
sprinklers start.
RICHARD FINCH, Bridget’s fifty-something-but-trying-to-lookyounger boss, pops his head through the studio backdrop.
RICHARD FINCH
Who the fuck set the sprinklers
off?
12

INT. HARD NEWS. CORRIDOR. DAY.

12

Bridget is striding down the corridor - a woman at the top of
her game - West Wing style - with two young, deferential
assistants JOSH and LAURA striding alongside, hanging on to
her every word, taking notes.
BRIDGET
Josh, I want you to see what
Reuters are saying about the
attacks in Ramallah. I might need a
live link. And Laura, tell Adam
I’ll be in to check the human
trafficking VT.
JOSH and LAURA peel off and MIRANDA joins her.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

MIRANDA
So, how will I be changing the
world today?
BRIDGET.
Well our main feature will be the
exclusive interview with the
Foreign Secretary about NGochi.
As she says “NGochi”- she does it with the authentic African
click.
MIRANDA
OMG, how do you do that? N-Gochi, NGochi.
She tries but fails to do the click.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
You are so good at that.
BRIDGET
I know, I’ve really been
practising, “NGochi”
They go backwards and forwards “NGochi-ing” at each other.
13

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIOS. HAIR & MAKE UP DEPT. DAY.
Bridget and Miranda continue to talk as Miranda is primped
and preened by a hair and make-up woman, CATHY.
Cathy tries to N’Gochi too. They are all at it.
CATHY
Oooh, it’s harder than you think.
BRIDGET
It’s all in the throat.
MIRANDA
And after “NGochi”...
She gets it right and high fives with Bridget and Cathy.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
... how do we plan to celebrate
tonight?
BRIDGET
Night out with the gang.
MIRANDA
Please say that involves group sex.
CATHY
I know a smashing little club for
that, just round the back of
Berwick Street.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

10

BRIDGET
Chance would be a fine thing. I’m
beginning to think I’ve passed my
sell-by-date. I’m like an old
packet of custard creams, all
mouldy and crushed.
MIRANDA
Nonsense. There are names for
people like you now Bridge, you’re
a cougar, a MILF.
BRIDGET
I’m not a MILF, I’m not even a Mum.
I’m a spinster, I’m a SPILF.
SUSAN comes in.
SUSAN
Three minutes until we’re on air.
Cathy has jotted down details. Hands them to Bridget.
CATHY
It’s called Voyeurz, with a z. Tell
them Cathy sent you. If you go on a
Thursday, there’s a Chinese buffet.
All you can eat...as it were.
14

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIO GALLERY. DAY.

14

Bridget takes prime position at the desk in the gallery in
front of all the monitors. She slips on her microphone.
15

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIO. FLOOR. DAY

15

Miranda takes her place on set, slips in her ear-piece.
FLOOR MANAGER
Twenty seconds to air.
HARD NEWS TITLES RUN.
Miranda continues to talk to Bridget through her microphone.
MIRANDA
Anyway, far too many women are
wasting their lives having babies
in their thirties and forties when
they should be getting on with
their careers.
FLOOR MANAGER
TEN, nine, EIGHT, seven, SIX,
five...
Miranda suddenly changes character - into impressive Emily
Matlis-type anchorwoman.

MIRANDA
Hello, and welcome to Hard News.
BONG MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Tonight, more attacks in Ramallah,
we go live as the world asks is it
time for the UN to intervene?
FOOTAGE RUNS so they can go on talking.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
You didn’t by any chance freeze
your eggs?
BRIDGET
God no, I imagine they’re hard
boiled by now.
MIRANDA
You know what Bridge, this weekend
we need to go out and engage in
some serious BONG - back on air.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Binge drinking; A dangerous scourge
on society. Is new legislation
needed?
FOOTAGE RUNS.
16

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIO. GALLERY. NIGHT
RICHARD FINCH enters.
RICHARD FINCH
Bridget, Miranda, I’ve told you not
to talk between the bongs.
Without looking up, they both give him the finger. Richard
exits the gallery.
BONGS AGAIN.
MIRANDA
The Foreign Secretary will be live
in the studio to talk about the
looming crisis in Muribundi.
FOOTAGE RUNS.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Or you could always try online
dating again.
BRIDGET.
Those dating sites are just full of
married men wanting affairs.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

12

MIRANDA
No, I’ve met all sorts of men. The
other night I was on Tinder and
half an hour later I’m in a three
way with...
BONG - BACK ON AIR
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Prince Andrew; The Royal Special
Representative for Trade and
Investment has written his first
children’s book.
FOOTAGE RUNS.
Two young, hip and serious-looking professionals glide into
the back of the studio; power-dressed ALICE PEABODY and her
assistant. She watches proceedings sternly.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
But first, live in the studio I’m
joined by Foreign Secretary, George
Wilkins, who has just returned from
war ravaged Muribundi, where the
assassination of bloody dictator,
Charles Ngochi...
She can’t help but look pleased with herself.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
... has resulted in civil war.
Minister, was this a military coup?
GEORGE WILKINS
The signs are that Ngochi’s own
generals did take him out in a
bloody way, yes...
INTERCUT TO:
17

INT. GALLERY. DAY.
Bridget’s mobile rings. It reads TOM. Bridget picks up.
BRIDGET.
(hurriedly, whispering)
Hey Tom. Can’t really...
TOM
How was the service?
Bridget checks Miranda. She seems to be doing fine.
BRIDGET.
(to Tom)
Well, It’s just sad. I can’t
believe he’s gone actually.
Miranda hears Bridget in her earpiece.

17

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

13

MIRANDA
(to Minister)
Well, it’s just sad. I can’t
believe he’s gone actually.
GEORGE WILKINS
(somewhat bemused)
I don’t think there was a great
deal of sadness at his passing,
even by his most loyal followers.
His persecution of the Unbutu
people amounted to genocide. That’s
well documented.
18

INT. GALLERY. SAME TIME. DAY

18

BRIDGET
(to Tom)
I know he had his faults, he
could be a massive arsehole.
But I miss him. We all do.

MIRANDA
(to Minister)
I know he had his faults. He
could be a massive arsehole,
but I miss him. We all do.

The minister, clearly confused, but trying to play along.
At the back of the set, Alice takes notes.
GEORGE WILKINS
Well, he was a colourful character
on the world’s stage, I give you
that. But I think the genocide
along with his eugenics programme
resulting in the deaths of over
10,000 of his own people, men,
women and children, put him on the
wrong side of....
BRIDGET
At least he was never boring.

MIRANDA
At least he was never boring.

Wilkins looks at Miranda, now totally perplexed and
speechless.
19

INT. GALLERY. SAME TIME.

19

Bridget signs off to Tom and puts down the phone.
Thinking everything is going well, she now starts paying
attention to the interview.
BRIDGET
(to Miranda)
Do you think a spirit of
democracy can carry over into
West Africa now Ngochi’s
dead?
Back on course! Phew.

MIRANDA
(to Minister)
Do you think a spirit of
democracy can carry over into
West Africa now Ngochi’s
dead?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

14

GEORGE WILKINS
Now that IS an interesting
question. Finally.
Bridget looks very pleased.
20

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIO. GALLERY. LATER.
Richard and Miranda stand in the gallery.
RICHARD
Thank you Miranda and Bridget, you
couldn’t just behave yourself when
the new management team were here?
BRIDGET
They’re the management team? I
thought they were the interns.
Richard points to the floor and Peabody.
RICHARD
No, that’s Alice Peabody. New Brand
Manager. Apparently Hard News is
too old fashioned, too serious, and
she’s the smiling assassin sent in
to sack anyone older than her.
BRIDGET
Everybody’s older than her. I’ve
got cans of soup in my cupboard
older than her.
RICHARD
(to Bridget)
You should watch your back.
MIRANDA
They won’t sack Bridget. She
rescued this show, she made it
relevant. She made us award
winning! And as a result she has no
life. Because everyone has
mercilessly abused the fact that
she is a lonely, single, childless
SPILF who works all hours.
BRIDGET
Thank you Miranda.
RICHARD
Look at them all with their apps
and their ironic beards.
MIRANDA
Maybe one of them will give Bridget
some sex.
RICHARD
Does Bridget need sex?

20

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

15

BRIDGET
No!
MIRANDA
Yes. Which is why I’m taking her on
the girls’ weekend to beat all
girls’ weekends.
A rap on the glass door makes them all whirl round. It’s
Alice Peabody. Richard looks at the studio floor confused.
ALICE
Bridget, isn’t it?
Alice looks her up and down, slightly witheringly.
BRIDGET
Yes. Pleased to...
ALICE
Team meeting tomorrow morning. We
can do introductions then.
Alice sashays out, Bridget does a pantomime ‘scared face’
behind her back as she walks away, Alice turns on her heels
and catches Bridget at it. Bridget disguises it as something
else, but fails.
ALICE (CONT’D)
9 a.m. We should all start an hour
earlier from now on.
21

EXT. OFFICE. NIGHT.

21

Bridget leaves with Miranda.
MIRANDA
And you’re sure you don’t want to
come out with me and my crew?
BRIDGET
Thanks, but I can’t let the old
gang down. They’d be disappointed.
Bridget switches her phone on after work and a flurry of
texts come through. Miranda heads towards the bike racks.
She reads a text from SHAZZER: ‘Happy Birthday. Sorry Bridge,
but can’t get a ‘sitter tonight.’
Bridget’s phone pings again. She reads a text from JUDE. A
vomiting emoji, four BABY FACE emojis and a SAD FACE emoji.
A third ping. TOM: “Where are you? Get your freak on, bitch?”
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Thank God for the gays!

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

INT. GYM. STROBE CYCLE. NIGHT.

22

Bridget enters a strobe-lit gym, almost tripping over. A
large sign reads STROBE CYCLE. Loud, gay club anthems bang
out.
TOM O.S.
Okay ladies, click in.
TOM, at the front of the class, on a spinning cycle. He’s
manning the record decks while simultaneously cycling and
speaking into a head-mic.
TOM
Whatever fears, whatever
insecurities you’re bringing in
with you today, I want you to take
those fears and tell them to FUCK
THE FUCK OFF!
An adoring, pumped up crowd of lithe young female bodies
furiously pedalling. They whoop. “Alright!”. Bridget
struggles to click her shoes into the pedals.
TOM (CONT’D)
THIS moment is about YOU, your
body, your dreams, your POTENTIAL.
The music’s pumping up to a crescendo.
TOM (CONT’D)
Are you ready for this? Are you
ready for this?
The women yell orgasmically. The music swells.
TOM (CONT’D)
Now. Ride, sexy bitches, ride!
And the women rise from their saddles and pedal like fuck.
Tom sprays water at them. Bridget looks like she might have a
seizure.
23

INT. GYM. NIGHT.

23

Tom waving off the last Strobe Cyclist. Bridget, exhausted,
barely able to breathe.
BRIDGET
(wheezing)
It will take me three martinis to
recover and you are buying.
TOM
About that. I’m so sorry Bridget.
I’m going to have to blow you out
too.
Bridget masks her disappointment.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

17

TOM (CONT’D)
The thing is... I didn’t want to
have to tell you this today.
Eduardo and I are adopting.
BRIDGET.
Adopting what... a baby?
TOM
No, a new stance on illegal
immigration! Yes, a baby, or a
gayby, in fact.
BRIDGET
Oh Tom, this is fantastic news!
She gives him the biggest hug.
TOM
I didn’t want to say anything
because we always do our “we’re
pointless-empty-husks- stickingtogether” thing. And I love that.
But truth is...if I’m being honest,
I feel it’s important for me, in
myself, to start caring for someone
other than me. And well, it looks
like we’ve been successful.
BRIDGET
Brilliant.
TOM
We’re going to Bogota to start the
official paperwork and I’ve got to
pack.
BRIDGET
It’s alright. Go! Go!
Bridget is left alone on a bicycle.
24

INT. BRIDGET’S FLAT. NIGHT. DARKNESS.

24

Bridget, alone, lights a candle on a single cupcake. She
pours herself a glass of wine and reaches for a cigarette in
an old packet on top of the cupboard. Then thinks better of
it. The radio plays, “All By Myself”.
BRIDGET.
Oh fuck off!
She flicks it off.
25

INT. ST. PANCRAS STATION. DAY.
The station concourse is thronging with commuters.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

18

BRIDGET (V.O.)
Must not dwell on why the
biological clock, though clearly
ticking, has not compelled me yet
to Colombia, or Olly Husbands
Bosworth’s sperm, or even into the
arms of inappropriate men met on
Internet. Always thought I’d find
love of my life and then baby would
follow. I may be old of womb, but
will remain young at heart. Will
start to embrace life in manner of
thirty-something friends like
Miranda, who don’t seem to care
about settling, or babies, or
ticking clocks.
We tilt up from a pair of Hunter wellies, cut-off denim
shorts, a backpack. Miranda makes her way across the
concourse to meet Bridget.
We tilt up from a pair of elegant high-heels, a smart dress
and a giant wheelie suitcase. Bridget spots Miranda.
BRIDGET
What the fuck!

27

EXT. MUSIC FESTIVAL. DAY

27

Miranda and Bridget enter the festival. Bridget is wheeling
her smart suitcase through the mud with little success. There
are posters everywhere advertising bands or specific tents
and wherever there is a sign it features a ‘SPONSORED BY
QWANTIFY’ logo.
MIRANDA
I didn’t tell you because I knew
you wouldn’t come. Anyway, it’s not
camping, it’s ‘glamping’.
BRIDGET
Putting a ‘Gl’ before it doesn’t
make it any better. Calling him
Gladolf Hitler wouldn’t suddenly
make you forget all the
unpleasantness.
MIRANDA
Come on Bridge, it’ll be fun. What
you need is a good shafting, some
good old fashioned, lie-back-andthink-of-England bonking. Festivals
are sexual free-for-alls, it’s like
Sodom and Gomorrah, with tofu.
Bridget looks at her.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

19

MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Seriously. It’s been five years.
You need to get out of this selfimposed purdah you’ve been in since
you split up from “he whose name
shall not be mentioned.”
BRIDGET
Rubbish, I barely think about him.
MIRANDA
Prove it. The first man you meet,
you have to sleep with.
BRIDGET
The first man?!
MIRANDA
I’m not taking no for an answer.
We’ve got backstage passes, we’ll
be rubbing shoulders with
rockstars. And we’ve got yurts.
I got you this... in case of an
emergency.
Miranda holds out a loo roll and 2 plastic bags, One Lidl,
one Marks and Spencer’s - Bridget grabs the M&S bag.
A DREAD-LOCKED GUY approaches Bridget with a suspicious wrap.
DREAD-LOCKED GUY
Meow meow?
BRIDGET
Woof woof.
(to Miranda)
I’m not sleeping with him.
Behind him is a poster advertising the literary tent, with a
picture of JACK QUANT - the caption reads ‘Algorithms Change
The World’.
MIRANDA
(to Bridget)
I’ll get the backstage passes. You
find a map.
She strides off. Bridget heads in the opposite direction. As
she walks her heels gets stuck in the mud and as she steps
forward, she leaves it behind. She tries to go back to grab
it, but the other heel gets stuck, and she is caught in what
is effectively the splits, unable to extricate herself from
her shoes.
After a struggle she pulls one of the heels out.
JACK (O.C.)
That’s exactly why I didn’t wear my
heels.
Reveal JACK QUANT, an insanely handsome 45 year old American.

JACK (CONT’D)
May I?
He lifts the floundering Bridget out of the mud, rescues her
heel and places her safely at the top of the little hill. He
places her shoe back on her foot.
JACK (CONT’D)
It fits!
Bridget laughs, faintly embarrassed.
BRIDGET
Thank you... I....
Miranda appears waving wellies and shorts. She shouts.
MIRANDA
Bridget!
JACK
Is that your wicked stepmother?
BRIDGET
I should go, or she’ll have me
sweeping fireplaces all afternoon.
Nice to meet you...
She’s already heading off.
JACK
It’s Jack...

Miranda are downing every cocktail, real ale and vodka shot,
and as they ‘cheers’ each other, they shout.

INT. EDM DANCE TENT. DAY.

31

Bridget and Miranda are dancing away like dervishes amongst
the ridiculously young crowd to a thumping dance track,
having the time of their lives. There are people in Zorb
balls on the dancefloor. Bridget shouts across to Miranda.
BRIDGET
(Gleeful)
It’s 2.30 in the afternoon! I
should be hoovering!
32

INT. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

32

A tipsy Miranda and Bridget are backstage having fun by the
bar.
BRIDGET
This is incredible, we have to get
a photo.
Bridget turns round to find somebody to take a photo of them.
She taps the person next to them at the bar on the shoulder.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Excuse me, would you mind if we
asked you to...
He turns round - REVEAL

- it’s ED SHEERAN.

ED SHEERAN
Of course not, total pleasure.
Bridget hands Ed the camera and he then places himself in the
middle of Bridget and Miranda - who just stare at him like
he’s insane. There is a long pause.
MIRANDA
What on earth are you doing?
ED SHEERAN
I thought you wanted a picture.
MIRANDA
We did! Of us!
BRIDGET
Yes, terribly sorry, we thought it
would be fun to have a picture of
us backstage among all these
glamorous people. I think that’s
the man from ‘Cash In The Attic’ ,
it would be great if you could get
him in shot.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

22

ED SHEERAN
Right, and you don’t want me in the
picture at all?
BRIDGET
We just wanted you to take a selfie
of us.
He attempts to make a joke to lighten the situation.
ED SHEERAN
Well then it wouldn’t be a selfie,
would it? It would be a ‘youfie’.
Miranda just stares at him witheringly, then grabs back the
phone.
MIRANDA
And an attitude to boot! Is it
really so difficult?
They walk away leaving a shocked Ed Sheeran hanging.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Honestly, they let any riff-raff
backstage nowadays.
As they walk away Bridget turns around and exchanges a smile
with him.
BRIDGET
I thought he was kind of cute. He
looked very familiar. I think he
works in the Starbucks in Balham.

INT. EDM TENT. DAY.

A tipsy Miranda and Bridget are looking lost. They spot a
tent.
MIRANDA
Let’s go to the Mantra tent next,
that’s where FKA Twigs is playing.
BRIDGET
Great! I love him... her... them?
34

INT. LITERARY TENT. DAY
An INTERVIEWER sits on stage opposite Jack Quant. Behind
them a bank of screens bearing the ‘Qwantify’ logo.
INTERVIEWER
Since floating his empire which
includes the online dating site

INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
And he’s also sponsoring this
festival.

A round of polite applause.
INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
But it all began with the strum of
Cupid’s arrow, right?
The audience laughs.
JACK
Well, it began with a broken heart.
Dating seemed irrational, so I
wanted to see if the mysteries of
human attraction could be broken
down into something mathematical.
Suddenly a rowdy Bridget and Miranda bound into the tent
assuming it’s FKA Twigs.
MIRANDA
Wooo, fuck yeah!
All heads turn as Bridget and Miranda stop in their tracks.
JACK
(looking directly at
Bridget)
I believe there is someone out
there for everyone... if we just
ask the right questions and apply
the laws of mathematics.
The audience listen intently.
MIRANDA
Come on let’s go. Who wants to do
maths at a festival? Let’s get shitfaced.
BRIDGET
(whispering to Miranda)
Let’s stay...he’s interesting.
Bridget forces Miranda to sit down in two empty seats. Back
on stage Jack has the crowd rapt.
INTERVIEWER
And now you’ve moved from matchmaking to global business
partnerships.
JACK
Yes, that same algorithm has helped
bring together the world’s most
needy with the world’s most
wealthy.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

24

As if to illustrate this point, behind him photos of cocoa
farmers in Columbia switch around the screen to match with
chocolate factories in Switzerland; Yak farmers in Tibet with
coffee houses in San Francisco.
MIRANDA
(shouting out to the
crowd)
BORING!
JACK
Okay. I get it, you don’t want to
talk about algorithms at a
festival. So let me show you how
they can be...sexy. Take out your
phones.
Murmured curiosity as the audience take out their phones.
Jack reaches into his pocket and takes out his own.
JACK (CONT’D)
Take a photo.
Jack takes a photo of himself, taps on the screen and uploads
it. At once his ludicrously handsome photo appears with some
of his answers underneath.
It reads - Jack Quant ‘interests - Environmentalism,
Trekking, Lady Mary’.
JACK (CONT’D)
Now quickly answer a couple of
questions.
Miranda takes out her phone and hurriedly fills out the
questionnaire. She takes a photo of a resistant Bridget.
MIRANDA
I’ve put down that you like French
cinema - it’s sophisticated and
slutty at the same time.
Miranda takes a snap of herself.
JACK
Then upload it to the Qwantify
website and the results should
start coming up on the screen
behind me.
More and more photos upload from the audience. Suddenly a
photo of Miranda appears - she looks amazing. Then one of
Bridget - she is slightly out of focus, mouth open.
JACK (CONT’D)
French cinema, huh? Slutty and
sophisticated.
As more pictures appear he comments.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

JACK (CONT’D)
It’s science, you’d be foolish to
resist it.

This could be the start of
something special, or at least a
quick fumble in a sleeping bag.
To guy with white hair & beard.
JACK (CONT’D)
Ooo, there you go Gandalf, seems
you’re not the only one looking for
a ring.
The good looking couple are matched.
JACK (CONT’D)
Now you guys would have good
looking babies.
A pair come up who both have as one of their interests ‘nights in on my own’
The girl does the ‘call me’ motion.
JACK (CONT’D)
He doesn’t have to call you, he’s
literally here.
Various other photos appear with captions. INTERVIEWER’s
picture comes up with - ‘Social Anthropology, Sunsets’.
A quiet marvelling as more and more photos upload from the
audience, coming together, aligned in ‘couplings’.
The INTERVIEWER’S photo attaches to a particularly attractive
woman, his eyes light up.
Miranda flushes, now matched with a rather odd looking man
sitting to her left.
JACK (CONT’D)
Remember what happens at the
festival, stays at the festival,
unless it goes on Instagram then
300 million people can see it.
Miranda grabs Bridget’s arm. A rather earnest looking man
with a very old plastic bag in his hand smiles at Bridget.
She looks back at the screen. They’ve been matched.
JACK (CONT’D)
Never question the algorithm, see
there really is someone for
everyone...
Bridget and Miranda get up and edge out of the tent.
Suddenly on screen, Jack’s photo is matched with Bridget’s
and the earnest man is knocked down to a photo below.

Bridget, now loving festival life, jiggles on top of
Miranda’s straining shoulders.
MIRANDA
Oh my god.
BRIDGET
I know... It’s the guy from
Starbucks!
LATER: Miranda bucks Bridget off her shoulders. As she is
crowd-surfed over the heads of the fans, Bridget’s image
appears on a multitude of screens flanking the stage.
LATER: Miranda is in her bra inside a giant inflated zorb
ball rolling around.

INT. YURT. NIGHT. LATER.

Bridget crashes into the pitch black yurt, laughing. She rips
off her dress, flops into bed, exhausted.
BRIDGET
I’ve got to admit, that was fun.
No response.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
You know what, you’re right, what I
need is a good shafting, some good
old fashioned, lie-back-and-thinkof-England bonking.
JACK
Sign me up.
Bridget sits bolt upright, startled. Jack puts on the light,
smiles gently at her.
BRIDGET
Oh my god... how? (genuine
surprise) What are you doing in my
yurt...?
She looks around and sees all his things scattered.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
With all your possessions, and
clothes, and luggage...

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

27

They laugh.
JACK
Yup, it’s almost as if I’ve come in
and made it my own, right?
Bridget takes another look at Jack.
BRIDGET
Oh my god, you’re the algorithm

JACK
And wait, it’s you, the creature

French cinema, right?
Bridget smiles at him.

Ed Sheeran performs an unplugged version of ‘Thinking Out

INT. JACK’S YURT. NIGHT.

38

Bridget is lying on her front on the bed, facing Jack as he
fills in the Qwantify questionnaire online. Their faces
illuminated by the screen.
BRIDGET
I thought you said a few questions.
JACK
Nearly there. Do you believe in
God?
BRIDGET
Only when absolutely necessary.
When facing major illness and/or
when stuck in a lift.
JACK
Have you ever eaten anything off
the floor?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

28

BRIDGET
Usually after applying the fivesecond rule, but not if it’s butterside down.
JACK
Have you ever done anything you’re
ashamed of?
BRIDGET
Well, I pretended to be disabled to
get to the front of a Duran Duran
concert; I watched ‘Dirty Dancing’
eight times in one day, and had sex
with Olly Husbands-Bosworth in my
Dad’s old Renault.
Jack laughs.
JACK
I’m running out of space... Would
you sleep with someone on the first
date?
There is a long pause.
BRIDGET
Tricky....but on reflection...quite
possibly...yes. (Beat) Does it
count if you’ve got money on it?
JACK
Depends how much?
BRIDGET
Terms were not officially agreed
but it went along the lines of my
friend betting me that I had to
sleep with the first man I met.
And was I?

JACK
The first man?
BRIDGET

Second.
JACK
You might have just lost your bet.
He leans forwards and kisses her.
BRIDGET
Are we finished with the questions?
JACK
A couple more.
Things are heating up.

Jack kisses her again.

JACK (CONT’D)
I need to know what things you

absolutely sure I don’t offend.
He starts to kiss her neck.

Is this off the agenda?
BRIDGET
A hundred percent.

Right.

I’m not that

JACK
So I presume this is a no-

He reaches round to undo her bra.
BRIDGET
Without question.
JACK
Excellent. I’m really beginning to
paint a picture of the kind of girl
you aren’t.
BRIDGET
Do you think you may have found me
a match?
JACK
I’ll have to run the numbers but
I’m pretty hopeful we can find
someone within your criteria. It’s
looking like a 97 percent match.
Although would you mind an
American?
BRIDGET
An American? Sounds terrible...
They kiss.

Miranda is now in the giant zorb ball with Ed Sheeran. They
roll down a hill and straight into the portaloos, two of
which they knock over.

INT. YURT. SUNDAY MORNING. DAWN.

Bridget wakes with a start. Turns. The other side of the bed
is empty. She looks around blearily, she sees her phone to
check the time and there is a text from Miranda.
“Where are you?”
With a panic Bridget jumps out of bed and grabs her clothes.

EXT. YURT. LATER.

41

Nobody is awake. It’s been raining and the field is a swampy,
muddy bog.
Bridget, in a flap, jumps out of Jack’s yurt, lands in a
boggy patch and can’t extricate her Wellington boot.
Panicked, she simply takes her foot out and runs off with one
bare foot.

Shazzer and her twins, RUBY and SPIKE (5) wait by Shazzer’s
car. Shazzer oblivious as Bridget slips two blue fizzy Haribo
bombs into their mouths. They smile at her in delight.
SHAZZER
So it lasted six hours?
BRIDGET
At least.
Ruby shouts over.
RUBY
What lasted six hours Mum?
SHAZZER
Erm, a puppet show Auntie Bridge
went to...

SHAZZER
And did he...(struggling) put the
puppets in your mouth?
The children look very confused. Bridget nods.
SHAZZER (CONT’D)
God I feel like my days of puppet
shows are behind me. I’ve never
even had 2 puppets at a time, had a
mile high puppet show... And has he
called? It’s been a week.
BRIDGET
That’s not how it works now. You
just hook up with rugged
troubadours at music festivals and
there are no strings. Puppets with
no strings.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE HOTEL. BEDROOM. DAY.

48

A chic, expensive room. JUDE dresses her 6 year old, POPPY,
whilst talking on speaker into her iPhone. They both have
frightful colds. Giles is in the background getting ready.
JUDE

The child watches her mother carefully and expressionlessly
before sneezing wetly all over her.

after Tom dropped out, Giles asked
Mark to be the godfather, the
prick.
BRIDGET
(Horrified)
He did what?
JUDE (O.S.)
I know he really is a useless cock,
did it without asking me.
Bridget tenses.
52

INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. DAY.

52

The service is already underway. Bridget, Shazzer and the
kids come in at the back of the church.
BRIDGET (V.O)
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck.
A roiling sea of smug-marrieds and their offspring fill the
pews. Shazzer and the kids duck into a pew, leaving Bridget
to run the gauntlet, tottering down the aisle to the font
where the christening party is waiting for her. The baby is
crying.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
(muttering left and right)
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
POPPY stands beside a cross-looking Jude as Bridget
approaches.
POPPY
(repeating her mother’s words)
Where the FUCK were you?
Bridget gets a frosty reception from Jude, Giles and the
VICAR. She acknowledges Mark Darcy. He gives what looks like
a disapproving nod in return.
Irritably, Jude hands Bridget the baby. It immediately stops
crying. The baby loves her.
53

EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH. DAY.

Bridget and Darcy still haven’t had a chance to speak. Jude,
Giles, Bridget and Darcy are lining up for photos.

Bridget is still holding the baby who is sleeping peacefully.
MAGDA and JEREMY, friends of Bridget’s, are there with three
ill-behaved boys in tow.
MAGDA
Look at Bridget - she’s a natural.
JEREMY
Need to get a move on though. Mind
you, that woman in Italy had a baby
at 65.
Magda nudges him, smiles apologetically at Bridget.
BRIDGET
Number one on my to-do list!
JEREMY
Want a hand?
Magda hits him. Mark looks awkwardly at the floor.
PHOTOGRAPHER
OK, can I just have the godparents
now?
The rest of the congregation peel away, leaving just Mark,
Bridget and the baby. In an alternate universe...
MARK
(stiffly)
So, how are you?
BRIDGET
Very well thank you? And you?
MARK
Well. Yes. Thanks.
Mark is incredibly uncomfortable and awkward around the baby.
BRIDGET
Are you here with your wife? I’m
sorry I can’t remember her name.
MARK
Camilla. No. She er... no. Couldn’t
make it. Are you with anyo....?
BRIDGET
No. Not...today... No.
She trails off, busies herself with the baby.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Come on it’s not a funeral. What
about a couple of smiles from you
two? Maybe give her a little kiss
on the forehead?
Darcy leans over to give Bridget the most awkward of pecks on
the forehead.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

34

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
That’s lovely, but I was talking
about the baby.
BRIDGET
(tries to break the ice)
We should probably just acknowledge
that this is unbelievably awkward,
no?
MARK
Sorry?
BRIDGET
This? You and me holding a baby,
you know, since well... you know.
MARK
Right, yes, put like that...
He doesn’t get a chance to elaborate because Jude interrupts.
JUDE
Bridget, they want to get a photo
with you and me and the baby.
BRIDGET
Yes. Good.
MARK
Well. I’ll see you later I
shouldn’t wonder.
BRIDGET
Yes... unless I try and make a
break for it with this thing.
Healthy babies can fetch a fortune
on the black market and I
desperately need a new boiler.
(talking to the baby)
Shall we sell you? Shall we?
The baby chortles back at her. The photographer looks
horrified, Mark smiles.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. HOTEL. DAY.

The party is well underway. Darcy stands with a group of
fathers including Giles & Fergus. Bridget is wandering around
followed by a crocodile-line of kids. Darcy and Bridget
pretend not to notice each other.
On a band of mothers, all talking to a HEAVILY-PREGNANT
WOMAN, GINNY. Bridget tries to sneak past.
WONEY
Here she is. Everyone’s favourite
godmother. How many godchildren

BRIDGET
Running into six figures, Woney.

Woney’s arm. Woney screams.

mind?
BACK TO REALITY.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Good advice. Thanks.
GINNY
You know there was a woman in Italy
who had a baby when she was 65.
BRIDGET
Wow, I did not know that.
GINNY
Ooh! There she goes! She’s kicking
me!
BRIDGET
And who can blame her?
The women stare at her.
BRIDGET.
With all this noise and excitement.
GINNY
Do you want to feel?
BRIDGET
No, I’m okay GINNY
I really don’t mind. Feel. The.
Bump.

Oh. Right. Okay.

Hello.
MARK
How are you?
BRIDGET
I’m very well thank you. How are

killing each other in order to get a turn on the iPad.
BRIDGET
Zak, your Mum said thirty minutes.
Off! Now!
BOY ONE
Wait! I’m about to shoot the pimp!
Bridget looks at the screen horrified as the boys kick and
thump each other. The youngest winds Bridget’s hair around a
Thomas the Tank Engine. Suddenly the child is hoisted away as
if by magic. Bridget sags with relief.
MARK
That’s no way to treat a lady,
boys. Here, look -

Mark picks up the iPad and sits on the floor. The boys
cluster around it.
MARK (CONT’D)
Right, vigilantism is no solution,
let the police deal with the pimp,
he’ll face a minimum of eight years
in custody, assuming no previous,
and how about you all sit round and
watch this thing with cows in
space...
Bridget rises to her feet, watching. The boys, absorbed in
this new film, have forgotten she exists. Mark speaks without
looking up.
MARK (CONT’D)
I’d go while the going’s good.
BRIDGET
Thanks.
Bridget walks away. She stops behind a flower display and
looks back at Mark patiently watching a film with five
irritating children.
MARK
See that’s the first issue right
there, cows with opposable thumbs,
ludicrous...

We find Jude fast asleep in her hotel room, with the baby

INT. DANCE FLOOR. HOTEL. NIGHT.

57

Dancing has started - a kind of kid/adult disco affair as
children run around drunk adults. Giles & Fergus are DJing
badly.
The music playing is GANGNAM STYLE.
Bridget - by now quite merry and wearing Poppy’s fairy wings still has the toy train wound into her hair. She’s dancing
with all the children, and doing all the horsey-ridey moves.
Despite the silliness of the dance Bridget is in her element,
she knows the dance really well and is mesmerizing, a strange
combination of graceful, sexy and fun.
Mark Darcy stands aloof, a bit tortured, observing,
inadvertently rapt by her. Bridget, mid dance, spots him
looking alone and after a moment’s pause ‘Gangnam Styles’
over.
BRIDGET
I’d ask you to join me, but I’m
pretty sure you’re not a real
Gangnam Style kind of guy.

I was only there very briefly.
BRIDGET
Where?
MARK
Gangnam.
Bridget looks puzzled.
MARK (CONT’D)
What are we talking about?
BRIDGET
Gangnam? Dancing.
MARK
Ah, I see. Not the suburb of Seoul.
BRIDGET
No.
MARK
Right.
BRIDGET
I’m not familiar with Gangnam the
suburb.
MARK
It literally means ‘south of the
Han river’. It was inhabited as
early as the Paleolithic period.
Bridget stops dancing.
BRIDGET
Right, it suddenly seems so much
less catchy.
Fergus, on ‘the decks’ spots them together and immediately
changes the tune. Something lovely starts to play.
FERGUS (O.C.)
Now a little something for all you
lovers out there. We’re entering
the ‘erection section’.
A shout rings out over the crowd.
SHAZZER(O.C.)
Don’t say fucking ‘erection’ at a
christening.

Shall we get some air?
They walk outside.

No. I gave up. 691 days ago.
MARK
Not that you’re counting...
BRIDGET
Since when did you smoke?
MARK
I don’t. It’s been a tense time.
And maybe I’m nervous.
BRIDGET
Why?
They stop and stare at each other.
MARK
You have a train in your hair.
BRIDGET
I am aware of that.
MARK
Seems to be stuck. And is this...

Mark starts getting the train out.
Suddenly he pulls her to him. They kiss. She pulls away.
BRIDGET
What are you doing? You’re married.
MARK
No I’m not. Well I am. We’re
getting a divorce. That’s why she’s
not here.
BRIDGET
But you were there together at

No, she was just there to be

Bridget stands alone on the steps of the imposing building.
She is holding her award. She is looking up and down the
road, as if waiting for someone to arrive. The last of the
event’s attendees trickle down the steps, one or two of them
congratulating her as they pass.
Finally, she walks down the steps, alone and sad, and stands
waiting on the pavement.
At the sound of a car, she looks up and smiles with relief

Alice Peabody is addressing the assembled staff of Hard News.
Richard Finch sidles in looking every inch the hipster with
full beard and moustache. He smiles smugly at Alice’s hipster
assistants.
ALICE
It’s called ‘news’ because it
should feel new, otherwise it would
be called ‘olds’. Last night our
top three stories were twenty-three
dead in the Middle East, boring,
Earthquake in Asia, seen it before,
car crash on the M5, blah blah
blah. We are making ‘olds’. We need
to flip the switch, mix it up. I
want to nutri bullet the shit out
of the news.
Richard leans across to Bridget and Miranda.
RICHARD
She’s on the warpath. Susan the
Floor Manager has gone. She was 37
for God’s sake.
BRIDGET
She was 6 months pregnant!
Alice Peabody confers with an assistant about the powerpoint
presentation.
ALICE
We need to grab the attention, get

like, is your sofa bed giving you
cancer? Is your freezer giving you
Alzheimer’s?

Alice is annoyed at this challenge.
ALICE
Literally no evidence, but you’re
missing the point. You’re intrigued
aren’t you? I want to launch Hard
News’s rebranding with a clear new,
objective. We have a presentation
in twelve weeks at the London Media
Show and I need someone dynamic,
innovative and focused to lead the
charge. Any volunteers?
In a fit of enthusiasm Bridget thrusts up her hand, she is
the only person to do so. Everybody looks stunned, including
Alice, who chooses not to acknowledge her.
ALICE (CONT’D)
Anybody at all?...
Still, only Bridget’s hand remains aloft. Miranda leans over
to her and whispers.
MIRANDA
You do realise this is extra work

No, I want to volunteer.

SHAZZER
So you’re what?
BRIDGET
Peri Menopausal. The symptoms are
‘Memory lapses, mood swings, weight
gain.
For some women this can begin as
early as thirty five.’ We’re a
biologically oppressed race!
SHAZZER (O.S.)
Before you become too oppressed,
let’s rule out some other options.
You’re not pregnant, are you?
BRIDGET
Of course not! I always carry
condoms in my handbag and I made
them use mine!
She pulls out the condom-box from her bag and examines it.
It’s crumpled and decrepit.
SHAZZER
Oh god, you didn’t use those weird
Vegan thingies?
BRIDGET
Bio-degradable and dolphinfriendly. If I’m going to be slutty

Bridget is sitting with DR. RAWLINGS who is holding up a

BRIDGET
So which of the times with me and
my wonderful man do you think we
might have got pregnant on?
DR. RAWLINGS
Does it matter?
BRIDGET
Well, yes! It’s such a special
moment! We want to know which one
it is so we can treasure it.
DR. RAWLINGS
Can’t you treasure both of them?
BRIDGET
We will and do, of course, but
surely one of those dates is more
likely than the other?
DR. RAWLINGS
Actually Day 10, his birthday, is a
bit early and Day 16, which was BRIDGET
- after our anniversary dinner DR. RAWLINGS
- yes. Is a bit late. Are you sure
there wasn’t another treasurable
occasion in between?
BRIDGET
Quite sure because - he was away
for a few days - he’s such a busy
bee! Always on business trips. So
which of the two would you go for?
DR. RAWLINGS
No idea. Both equally likely.
Could’ve been after the events
because as you know, sperm can live
for several days after ejaculation.
Bridget’s eyes bulge.

Certainly not.
BRIDGET
What about the first scan then?
Will that show when conception took
place?
DR. RAWLINGS
No. Call this number to fix a date
for it. And do bring the father. If
you can work out which one he is...
Bridget is caught.
BRIDGET
Right. Just out of interest...
DR. RAWLINGS
Yes?
BRIDGET
If someone did have an element of
confusion about who the father was DR. RAWLINGS
- you can get DNA from the baby at
the amniocentesis. And I do
recommend that you have the
amniocentesis. There are always
more risks with a geriatric mother.
BRIDGET
Geriatric? That’s outrageous.

Indeed.

your ‘fathers’ yet?
BRIDGET
Yes of course. Do I? What if I’m
too much of a coward? No, you’re
right.
TOM
Or at least one of them. Get their
DNA and you can eliminate one of
them from your enquiries.
BRIDGET
This isn’t CSI St. Pancras... Which
one do I tell? What would I even
say to Mark? ‘Hello Mark, I was
just passing by, I know I left you
asleep etc etc. But I don’t suppose
you’ve got any blood, sperm or old
fingernails lying around?’. And
Jack’s a bloody billionaire. It’s
not like I can just ring him up or
give him a friend request on
Facebook.
Shazzer is busy googling him on her phone.
TOM
I can’t believe you slept with a
gorgeous billionaire. If you need
his DNA, I’m totally prepared to
extract it for you.
BRIDGET
Why couldn’t I have just shagged a
bloody plumber? He’ll just think
I’m another awful gold digger,
he’ll never answer my calls. I have
no clue how I’ll ever even see him
again.
Bridget takes another desperate sniff of the wine.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Can you order a scotch, I need a
sniff of something stronger.
The puppet show ends, the children come running over.

Jack smiles. The surrounding crew laugh as Cathy subtly looks
up to Bridget in the gallery who gives her a nod.
CATHY (CONT’D)
Ooh, you’ve got a little grey patch
here, shall I...
Before he has a chance to reply she whips out a pair of
scissors and snips off a lock of hair. She secretly puts it
in a plastic zip-loc bag.
CATHY (CONT’D)
And this silver fox’s nails could
do with a little bit of a trim too.
Ooh, these hands have not seen a

DR.RAWLINGS
Sound as a bell.
A great, beatific smile breaks out on Bridget’s face. Pure
joy...
The baby’s image comes up on the screen, Dr. Rawlings melts
into the background as Bridget becomes mesmerized by what’s
on the monitor.
BRIDGET
Oh my god, is that it?
Bridget starts to laugh and then to cry.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Is it alright?
DR. RAWLINGS
Perfect. You’re approximately 12
weeks along. Listen.
Dr Rawlings turns up the sound and there it is - the
heartbeat. Bridget looks smitten.
Dr. Rawlings goes out to organise the amniocentesis needle.
DR. RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
I’m glad you’ve decided on the
amniocentesis.
Bridget doesn’t hear this. She is staring at the image.
Suddenly a tiny hand is raised, this little bean of life.
Bridget smiles, tears pricking her eyes. Tiny feet are just
visible.
BRIDGET
Hello you. Wow. Is that your foot
or your ear? You have big feet.
Ooh, look at you waving already.
Hi! You’re obviously very advanced.
Quite the genius. This is it, this
is - you’re the best thing I’ve
ever seen. This wasn’t quite how I
planned to bring you into the world
but I’ll certainly try my best. So
you just keep snug and safe in
there while I try and sort the mess
out here and hopefully...
A pause.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
What the FUCK is that?
Dr. Rawlings has come back in and is bearing down on her with
the amnio needle. It’s ENORMOUS.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

DR. RAWLINGS
The amniocentesis needle. We pop it
in and get a tiny bit of fluid
which we can use to check for any
abnormalities and, of course, for
the DNA sample you need.
Bridget’s eyes widen.
DR. RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
Now there is a very slight risk of
miscarriage so you’ll have to keep
extremely still to make sure the
needle doesn’t come into contact
with the BRIDGET
- oh, no, no. That’s INSANE!
She gets up, clutching her midriff and backing away.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
What kind of a maniac would stick a
needle in a baby? Put it away, you
monster, put it away - Come on
little one. I’m taking you home.
She exits the cubicle, leaving the bewildered Dr. Rawlings
holding the needle.
99

INT. BRIDGET’S FLAT. SITTING ROOM. DAY.

99

Bridget comes into the flat, she flops on the sofa and
unwraps a baby outfit.
BRIDGET
I know they say it’s bad luck to
buy things for a baby before it’s
born, but I beg to differ. I think
it’s good planning. After all, who
doesn’t want to plan the outfit for
their big entrance? And you are
going to make such an entrance!
Bridget gets a piece of paper and a pen. She starts to draw.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
You know what, we’re going to be
fine. I’m sure of it. In Africa
they say it takes a whole village
to raise a child - Look, I’ll show
you our village... Look, there’s
you and me.
She draws a big smiley face in the middle of the paper with a
body and another, much smaller smiley face inside it. She
draws ‘spokes’ out from the faces.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
There’s Miranda, Tom and Shaz, in
reality they all have hands, but
hands are very tricky to draw.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

61

She draws a cartoon of the friends, they all have stumpy
hands. She draws a cartoon of Jude at the end of the second
spoke. She’s surrounded with lots of babies.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
There’s Jude and she’s got four
babies already and you’re all going
to be great friends!
She draws two more smiley faces at the end of the third.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
There’s Mum and Dad. They’ll spoil
you rotten, once I actually tell
them you exist.
Then, at the end of the fourth spoke, she draws Jack.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
There’s Jack, who we probably need
to - get to know a little bit
better before we decide about him,
but according to Google he does
have his own helicopter.
She adds a helicopter.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
I know that looks like a cat, but
it is in fact a helicopter.
And finally, at the end of the fifth spoke, she draws Mark.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
- and there’s Mark who will find
this a bit messy and modern, but
we’ll cross that bridge when we
come to it.
She looks at her drawing - it seems to comfort her, the
smiley faces surrounded by lots of other little smiley
figures. She pats her tummy.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
What?
There is a small pause. Bridget listens.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
What’s that? I ought to tell Mark
too? That’s very mature of you. No,
you’re right. Absolutely. I
absolutely must. I’ve been avoiding
it. You’re right. Would you like a
Aero or crisps? ... What’s that?
Both, you say?

INT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY

Bridget walks into the imposing lobby, looking apprehensive.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

62

BRIDGET (V.O.)
Mark, I have some exciting news.
Mark, I have the funniest story to
tell you. Mark, I’m up the duff.
She takes a deep breath and heads towards the courtrooms.
101

INT. MAIN COURTROOM. DAY.

101

Bridget enters the public gallery. She can see Mark Darcy, in
wig and gown, getting to his feet. Nine supreme court judges
are seated, smart in their suits. Mark is dashing,
authoritative and incredibly impressive.
MARK
My Lords, there is only one fraud
that has been committed here and it
is this. To use the laws of one
country to try to destroy the
freedom of speech of another. A
Trojan Horse to take away the right
of these brave young women to speak
the truth about the reality of
their beloved country.
In the dock are four ‘Poonani’ singers, wearing anti
government T-shirts.
MARK (CONT’D)
You may not like their music and
for that I cannot blame you. They
may not have mastered the
fundamentals of melody, or even the
most basic tenets of musicianship,
However, this is the land of
Shakespeare, Orwell, Lawrence. A
land built on the defence of free
speech. This is your opportunity,
my Lords, to send a very clear
message back to any country, any
ruler, any despot, that here in the
United Kingdom we will always
defend and protect women such as
P... P... Women such as these, who
have courageously and selflessly
chosen to risk their liberty and
quite possibly their lives to tell
the truth. Accordingly we
respectfully ask that the request
for extradition be denied and
quashed forthwith.
He is masterful, compelling. He takes his seat. The court
erupts.
JUDGE
Thank you, Mr. Darcy. The Court
will now adjourn and judgement will
be given in due course.
The Judge rises and everyone gets ready to leave. Poonani
explode in the dock.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

63

POONANI MEMBER
Poonani! Power to the Poonani!
In unison they form their hands into a triangle and point
them towards their crotches. Mark turns to his assistant,
PIERCE.
MARK
Oh Christ, I’m looking forward to
going back to some good, oldfashioned genocide.
As Mark collects his things to leave, he spots Bridget in the
public gallery.
102

EXT. ALLEY. NEAR TEMPLE. DAY.

102

Mark walks Bridget towards his office.
MARK
I wasn’t expecting to see you
again, after the ‘events’ at the
Christening.
BRIDGET
No, right... I understand. You were
very impressive in there today.
MARK
Thank you, although dealing with
them for the last month has made me
feel a certain amount of sympathy
for the totalitarian dictator who
wants to silence them. There’s only
so many times I can listen to the
resolutely un-catchy ‘Menstruation,
Castration, Liberation’.
BRIDGET
Makes you pine for a bit of Ed
Sheeran.
MARK
Who?

MARK
Err... Yes.
BRIDGET

MARK
Bridget?
BRIDGET
(blurting)
I’m pregnant.
MARK
Right... Congratulations.
Bridget nods.
MARK (CONT’D)
And how can I help?
BRIDGET
I’m three months pregnant.
Absorbing that this is something to do with HIM.
MARK
Oh! The Christening? You mean....
Bridget nods, she looks anxious as it sinks in.
MARK (CONT’D)
Well. This is... Right. If you’ll
excuse me for just one moment.
He leaves the room. She stands there, not knowing how this
will play out.

MARK
So. I think... this is possibly the
single, most wonderful piece of
information I have ever been given
in my entire life.
BRIDGET
Is it? OK. Obviously I have no
expectations of how all this will
turn out. But I just thought you
should know.
MARK
Of course. And I mean, how do you
feel? are you... happy?
BRIDGET
Yes, I think so, but my being
pregnant doesn’t mean the last ten
years haven’t happened. So much has
changed, you’ve been married,
I’ve... been on a number of long
haul holidays... Sri Lanka was a
real highlight. A baby isn’t some
sort of panacea.
MARK
I know that, but, right now, I just
can’t feel gloomy about it.
On Bridget’s face.
GAAAAAAH!
106

BRIDGET (V.O)
How can I tell him now?

INT. JUDE’S KITCHEN. DAY.

106

Bridget visiting Jude. The place is mayhem. JUDE, still in a
dressing gown with a huge cold-sore, is holding the new baby.
GILES is in a business suit, on the phone and trying to leave
for work. He is cleaning sick off himself and feeding the
toddler. Everyone is thick with colds. A Polish builder
wanders through, on the phone having a loud argument in
Polish. Through the kitchen window, another child is bouncing
on the trampoline in the garden.
BRIDGET
Thing is, they are both so happy
that it just feels cruel to tell
them the truth about the other and
frankly, I’m terrified.
Giles makes his way out of the room.
GILES
(on the phone)
Sorry Margaret, I am covered in
porridge. What time is my flight?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

66

JUDE
That’s the least of your
problems....POPPY! NO!... You’ve no
idea.
She just turns and shouts maniacally at Poppy mid sentence
without missing a beat. Bridget looks horrified.
BRIDGET
What do you mean?
Jude waits for Giles to leave the room. The Polish builder
shouts again.
JUDE
I know I’ve gone on and on about
how wonderful motherhood is in
public, Bridge, but I’ve been
lying.
BRIDGET
What? Why?
JUDE
Because everyone does. No-one tells
the truth. Babies are GHASTLY. They
ruin your life. Ruin it... PUT IT
DOWN!...
(she shouts at an unseen child)...
You’re always ill, you can’t go
out, you’re covered in a constant
layer of sick, wee, old food and
poo, there’s no time to wash, and
anyway there’s no point because you
don’t see anybody and you will
never have sex again - Giles tried
the other night and apart from the
fact that when he pulled off the
duvet I looked like I still had it
on, I couldn’t feel anything - not
a thing because it’s a wind-tunnel
down there, he said it was like the
Hadron fucking Collider and as for
my nipples Jude whips out a boob. We only see Bridget’s horrified
reaction. Jude spoons the boob back in.
JUDE (CONT’D)
Don’t do it, Bridge, or have it,
sell it, and buy a nice new car...
one of those lovely new Minis. Get
out, escape while you can.
BRIDGET
Thanks Jude. You’ve been - a great
help.
JUDE
No, thank you. That was good to get
off my chest.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

67

She gets up to leave and as she turns the corner she sees
MILO, her nine year old boy, throwing darts at Poppy. Bridget
looks horrified, and gives both of them a Haribo.
JUDE (CONT’D)
Let them get on with it, natural
selection.
107

INT. BRIDGET’S FLAT. LATER.

The door slams behind a panicked Bridget.
She passes her drawing pinned to the fridge door. She takes a
pen and crosses out Jude’s little cartoon figure.
BRIDGET (V.O)
Best avoided...

EXT. PARK BENCH. DAY
Dad and Bridget sit on a bench eating a sandwich.
DAD
Your Mum is going to be over the
moon.
BRIDGET
You promise not to tell her? I
can’t handle that right now.
DAD
I promise. It’s probably for the
best in any event. She’s pretty
wrapped up about whether to hold a
referendum over making the A418 a
dual carriageway. She thinks it
will bring in a flood of
undesirables from Kettering.
BRIDGET
Dad, I’m sorry. Not to know about
the father.
DAD
Don’t be daft, love. I know dozens
of people who could have been
anybody’s.
BRIDGET
So you’re not - disappointed? You
don’t think I belong on Jeremy
Kyle?
DAD
Not a bit of it. I’m thrilled.
He hugs her.

I’ve always had very dainty feet.
Just tell the truth, Bridget. You
can never go too far wrong telling
the truth.

INT. GIANNI'S CAFE. NIGHT.

109

Bridget and Mark staring at each other. GIANNI and his
brother, SERGIO, smile from the bar area, uncomfortably close
to their table.
BRIDGET (V.O)
So there I was. In the split of an
eco-condom I had gone from carefreegirl-slash-slightly-too-old-singlewoman-about-town to Mum-to-be with
two rather fantastic men in my
life, and with no clue about how I
was going to tell them the truth.
MARK
You sounded pre-occupied on the
phone, not your usual self. Is
everything OK...
Before Bridget can answer an enthusiastic Gianni comes to the
table and interrupts.
GIANNI
Mister Mark. Miss Bridget. I so
glad to see you back together.
Mister Mark she was so miserable
when you two parted.
Bridget trying to brush him off.
GIANNI (CONT’D)
I mean soooooo miserable. She eat
so much pasta.
BRIDGET.
Yes. Yes. Thanks Gianni.
GIANNI
And Pizza, and Chianti, but look
Miss Bridget now is so good you are
fat in a good way, fat with a
bambino, not with gnocchi and
Tiramisu and calamari. Now you are
eating for two.

Bridget smiles.
BRIDGET.
Ah, can’t let young Balthazar go
hungry, or Bartholomew.

Very, Notting Hill school gates. I

my grandfather. Jack’s a good
strong name, you can rely on a

Bridget blanches.
BRIDGET.
Yes, it’s one for the list

Bridget is sitting preparing her presentation on her Laptop.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
Hard to concentrate on impending
big presentation when all I can
think of is how to tell at least
one father the truth. Mark was
trickier than expected, he just
seemed so happy...
The buzzer goes. A voice comes slightly distorted through the
intercom, Bridget gets up to answer.
JACK (O.S.)
Hi surprise! It’s the father of
your child...
BRIDGET
Jack?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

JACK
Ha! Who else?
He is buzzed up. Bridget opens the door. Jack enters,
excited, carrying two huge bags and the Wellington boot she
left at the festival.
BRIDGET
You kept it?
JACK
Should we make sure it fits?
Bridget smiles.
BRIDGET
I wasn’t expecting to see you.
JACK
I wasn’t expecting to come. I’m not
used to being rejected...twice. But
I’ve been doing some thinking.
BRIDGET
I hope you have cake in that bag.
An excited Jack composes himself.
JACK
Bridget, this baby situation threw
me initially. We squashed an entire
relationship into one night and
skipped straight to the starting a
family phase. We never even had a
real second date, but just so you
know I would have taken you to
Ottolenghi’s, an amazing place in
Notting Hill. You would have had
the grilled salmon and pine nut
salsa. It’s unbelievable AND
healthy.
He produces takeaway boxes from inside his bag.
JACK (CONT’D)
We would have come back here, had
incredible sex and spent the next
couple of days sending each other
filthy texts.
He gets out his phone and presses send. Bridget’s phone
beeps, she picks it up and reads it - clearly a filthy text.
BRIDGET
I would not have let you do that to
me on a second date!
JACK
Why not? You let me do it on our
first...

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

71
JACK (CONT'D)
We would then have gone on a dirty
weekend away to the seaside, I
would have been manly and won you a
cuddly toy on the pier.

He produces a cuddly toy.
BRIDGET
But I really wanted the giant
Scooby Doo.
JACK
Nobody ever wins those, the
coconuts are glued on.
Bridget’s phone beeps again - another filthy text.
BRIDGET
(Flirtatiously)
OK... as long as you clean up
afterwards.
Unprovoked Jack starts shouting.
JACK
You are wilfully misunderstanding
me, I don’t even know her!
He storms out and slams the door. Bridget looks confused.
After a beat he returns with some amazing flowers that he has
hidden in the hallway.
BRIDGET
What are these for?
JACK
To say ‘sorry’. We had our first
fight, I wasn’t flirting with that
waitress, she means nothing to me.
Bridget smiles. He goes out to the hallway again and produces
a flat pack Ikea cabinet.
JACK (CONT’D)
And I’ve brought us some Swedish
furniture to make, because if we
can get through that, we can get
through anything.
Bridget is being swept off her feet.
JACK (CONT’D)
I’d find it adorable how your neck
goes blotchy when you’re nervous,
and I’d know you’d be the greatest
possible mother to my child. Why
does your neck go all blotchy by
the way?
Jack takes her in his arms, it feels incredibly safe and
reassuring.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

72

BRIDGET (V.O.)
I could have told him then, of
course, but suddenly the
possibility of a life of
spontaneous takeaway and flat pack
furniture seemed sort of
inviting...Bit of a pity to ruin it
and we wouldn’t want my neck going
all blotchy again... I’m going to
tell them both tomorrow.
Definitely. Without a shadow of a
doubt.

that, you can think again, sir.
Nobody has any desire to see your
bottom.
A caption appears on the screen.
DAVID CARTWRIGHT - CEO - London Media Show
We see his face register fury, before a reeling Bridget gets
rid of him, hurriedly switching screens.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Of course emailing or tweeting the
show could not be easier, simply
type in hardnews.co.uk...
At once Jack reaches for his cellphone.
A tweet pops up JACKQ1971- “Excellent new site, Hard News as
ever at the cutting edge”. Bridget looks to Jack who gives
her an elaborate and morale boosting thumbs up.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Ah, there we go, a bit more
representative.
Another tweet pops up, MARKDARCE ’Can’t wait to interact with
the number one news show on TV’.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
..or search ‘Hard News’ or simply
H.
Bridget types ‘H’ into the browser, but gets distracted when
she sees MARK DARCY, THERE at the back of the audience. Oh
shit...she wobbles....
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Because at Hard News we
believe...We believe...Hard News
is...ready and on the front line.
Bridget collects herself, but she’s left the H on the screen
and all her previous searches starting with ‘H’ displayed on
the massive screen behind her.

BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Asking the questions that the world

ON THE SCREEN:
HOW CAN I MAKE MY THIGHS LOOK THINNER?
HARRY STYLES NAKED.
HOW CAN I MAKE MY BOSS LIKE ME?
HOW CAN I GET MY BOSS FIRED?
HOW CAN I FIND OUT WHO IS THE FATHER OF MY CHILD?
The crowd are mesmerized by the searches. Bridget blissfully
unaware. She then looks behind, sees the searches. Is
horrified.

INT. SAME. FIVE MINUTES LATER.

Mark makes his way over to her. Her happiness at seeing him
is significantly tempered by the fact that she can see Jack
approaching behind.
MARK
I hope it’s okay me turning up,
surprising you. I mean, well done.
It was very...technically adroit?
As he says this Bridget sees Jack approaching and panics.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
GAAAAAH!
She grabs the nearest person to her.
BRIDGET
Mark Darcy I’d really love you to
meet....
She squints at this stranger’s name badge...
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Ariyaratna Sithamparanathan,
Ariyaratna is Area manager for DTC
technological solutions aren’t you
Ariyaratna?
Both men look perplexed as Bridget rushes to cut off Jack.
She is intercepted by Alice Peabody......
ALICE
What the hell was that? What were
you thinking? I have 4 voicemails
from David Cartwright on my phone
that I dare not listen to.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

BRIDGET
Well they say there’s only one
thing worse than being talked
about...
Bridget is trying to extricate herself, but Alice is
steadfastly blocking her way.
ALICE
Is it that presentation?
BRIDGET
Alice, I’m so sorry.
ALICE
Sorry doesn’t cut it, I seriously
have to question whether there is a
place for you at Hard News...
To her horror, she now sees Ariyaratna intercepting his hero,
Jack Quant and introducing him to Mark Darcy.
BRIDGET
So sorry I really have to...
And she leaves a furious Alice hanging, mid sentence.
MARK
Bridget! This is Jack Quant. He’s
really rather brilliant. I read
this tremendous profile of him in
the New YorkerBRIDGET
Right, yes. We actually know each
other.
Jack puts his arm round Bridget.
JACK
We sure do!
Mark slightly balks, looking confused. Ariyaratna
Sithamparanathan is still there.
JACK (CONT’D)
Why didn’t you introduce me to this
guy earlier? He’s great, you know
he’s representing that punk protest
band who are being extradicted?
BRIDGET
Yes. Yes I knew that too.
ARIYARATNA
Hi, we met fleetingly before, I’m
in charge of the data management
for most of Daventry.
A shell shocked Bridget ignores Ariyaratna.

BRIDGET
Well, I have to say it’s fantastic
that you are getting on so well...
because you actually have a lot in
common. I feel we should go and
discuss somewhere a bit quieter...
JACK
Fantastic.
MARK
Why not? I booked GIANNI'S.
ARIYARATNA
Great idea.
BRIDGET
I think you might have to sit this

INT. GIANNI'S RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Mark, Jack and a shell-shocked, silent Bridget are sitting at
a table. Mark and Jack are getting on like a house on fire.
GIANNI, laying the table, is enjoying the conversation too.
MARK
...so you really believe that
mathematics can help us - how did
you put it in your book - ‘analyze
human behavior previously invisible
to science.’
JACK
Well, it’s a theory.
GIANNI
(Butting in)
Is incredible idea.
MARK
Really? In my experience emotions
have a lot to do with it.
A pause. Bridget looks uncomfortable.
JACK
My dating algorithm is to help
people find love, not necessarily
replace it. Have you ever tried it
out?
Bridget laughs nervously.
JACK (CONT’D)
You’re single right?
MARK
Well-

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

81

Mark looks to Bridget - she smiles, even more uncomfortable.
GIANNI, frankly, confused.
MARK (CONT’D)
I suppose in a way...Yes...So, how
do you two know each other?
Bridget takes a deep breath.
BRIDGET
Well... it’s sort of a funny story,
sort of. You see, the thing is, a
few months ago on June 4th I met
Jack at a music festival.
MARK
Right.
BRIDGET
(Interrupting)
We got on very well and sort of
had... relations.
GIANNI backs off, pretends not to be listening.
GIANNI
Dio Mio!
MARK
Oh...Right..I see...that’s...
All of a sudden it’s a bit awkward.
BRIDGET
- and then the following week, that
is to say... on the 11th June at
Jude’s baby christening to be
precise, and following the
consumption of quite a lot of
alcohol, Mark and I..um..well..we
had similar ‘relations’.
It’s now very awkward.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
And this is the ‘funny’ part, I
suppose, and why in many ways it’s
good that we all met and are
getting on so well. The thing is
that owing to these ‘relations’ the
resulting - um - life-form
currently residing in my - um tummy - could in fact be either of
yours. I know I should have told
you both before, but I just
didn’t...you both seemed so happy.
JACK
Correct me if I’m wrong but did you
just say that the baby could be
either of ours?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

82

Bridget nods.
MARK
So you have no idea which of us is
actually the father?
GIANNI, wishing he was invisible.
BRIDGET
I know this is all very confusing.
I’ve made a mess of it and I’m
sorry, but one thing I’m certain
of, is, however we choose to do
this, the most important thing now
is this.
She points to her bump.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
OK?
A long pause.
JACK
Bridget, I’m not going to pretend
this isn’t a shock, but I just want
you to know whatever the
circumstances, you’re right, the
most important thing is the baby,
and I’m here to support you both.
Who knows this could be a great
adventure?
He puts his arm around her.
MARK
(Less convincingly)
I’m sorry, you’ll have to excuse
me, I have a meeting.
He gets up and leaves.

where Mum’s campaign launch is in full swing.
All of Grafton Underwood is present and the room is bedecked
with campaign slogans. There is a photographer in the
background. Mum sees Bridget and rushes over to greet her.
MUM

I don’t disagree in principle Pam,

MUM
Don’t be sarcastic Colin. Add it to

Dad rushes off to talk to speak to an official. Mum sees
Bridget at the back and rushes over to greet her.
MUM (CONT’D)
... Honestly, we started half an
hour ago where have you...
BRIDGET
What’s the emergency?
MUM
The Argus wants a family portrait.
What are you wearing?
Then she notices Bridget’s bump and stops dead.
MUM (CONT’D)
Oh my god, Bridget, are you...
Bridget nods, half nervous, half excited. Mum’s face lights
up.
MUM (CONT’D)
Why didn’t you say anything?
BRIDGET
I was worried you might be angry...
MUM
Why would I be?...(the penny drops)
Oh no Bridget. Who’s the father? Is
it Mark’s Bridget, do say it is?
BRIDGET
Well, yes in a manner of speaking,
sort of. What I mean is, there is
at least a fifty per cent chance.
MUM
A fifty percent chance?
BRIDGET
Mark and Jack Quant, he’s an
American.
MUM
Oh no Bridget...An American? Did
you have a three way?
Mum’s face drops. She sees the photographer heading over and
her face fills with fear. She sees the coat rack, grabs a few
coats and thrusts them at Bridget.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

MUM (CONT’D)
Oh no. Here, carry these, act as if

As they walk the photographer spots her and wants a picture.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Mrs. Jones can we...
Before Bridget can answer, Mum barks.
MUM
Here, this is a lovely place for
you to stand.
She places Bridget behind a counter where her bump is hidden.
Mum frantically starts to arrange sandwiches and cakes in
front of the bump to obscure it.
BRIDGET
What are you doing? Are you ashamed
of me? Are you hiding your first
born grandchild behind a pile of
mini quiches?
Somebody comes over to take a mini quiche - Mum slaps their
hand away.
MUM
Look, darling it’s just the
circumstances, I’m running for high
office and I’m presenting myself as
a paragon of family values, see?
She points to a poster that reads ‘PAMELA JONES, IF YOU LOVE
FAMILY AND YOU LOVE VALUE VOTE PAMELA JONES FOR FAMILY
VALUES’.
BRIDGET
Wait.... Still reading... It’s so
long...
(she finishes reading)
... Look, you might not be proud of
the circumstances, but at least you
can be proud of me. This isn’t the

She storms off, pauses, turns back, grabs a handful of mini
quiches and storms off again. As she marches out she passes
Una who spots her bump.

sophisticated adults who wanted the
best for the baby. People might
look back and see this as the dawn
of a new vanguard of parenting.

removes his helmet. Bridget looks relieved to see him.

BRIDGET
Thank you... both. Shall we go in.
JACK
Here, let me carry that for you.
He takes Bridget’s big handbag from her, she’s genuinely
appreciative of the gesture. Mark looks put out.
MARK
Right, do you want me to carry your
phone for you?
She is also carrying a tiny mobile phone. She hands it to
him.

INT. HALL. COMMUNITY CENTRE. LATER.

All the couples sit together in a semi-circle around DAISY, a
very pretty young woman, who listens with earth-shattering
brightness to one particularly lovely couple who are
addressing the group. Bridget, Mark and Jack are the oldest
people in the class, and obviously stand out as the only trio
in the room. Bridget looks anxious and self conscious as the
couples all introduce themselves.
DAISY
And who do we have here then?
BRIDGET
I’m Bridget. This is Mark and this
is Jack.
DAISY
(reading her list)
Oh lovely! You’re our second same
sex couple tonight.
Everyone claps. A lesbian couple look over and wave.
MARK
No, actually....
JACK
(looks at Mark
mischieviously)
Absolutely, and we just need the
gift of a baby to make us complete.

DAISY
(Looking at Bridget)
And you must be ...the surrogate?
Bridget plays along, looking at Mark and Jack.
BRIDGET
Exactly, just trying to make this
wonderful couple’s dream come true.
DAISY
Well the plan is to take you
through some of the basic things to
expect during the birth. To start
off, perhaps someone can tell me
what signs to look out for that
might indicate labour is starting?
Jack’s hand shoots up. Daisy points to Jack who leaps in.
JACK
Early labour will be characterized
by mild to moderate contractions,
up to thirty to forty-five minutes
apart, and often, but not always, a
rupture of the amniotic membrane.
Jack looks pleased with himself. Daisy looks surprised. Mark
speaks quietly.
MARK
Right yes, absolutely. Of course. I
mean, isn’t this something one
would normally leave to the
midwife?
JACK
Mark gets nervous about all of
this, it’s very new to you isn’t
it, lamb chop?
Mark could not look more uncomfortable.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
Like all visionaries I would
encounter bumps along the road, but
still had faith in my grand plan.

How would you like to give birth to
your placenta?

Water sloshes over Bridget.
Suddenly she begins to choke, then sink.
At once, Jack strips off his clothes, revealing a rippling
six pack, and leaps in to save her.
On Mark, catching his reflection in the window. He looks old,
tired and grey.
122

INT. MARK’S OFFICE. CHAMBERS. NIGHT

122

Mark sits in his office, late at night, reading studiously
with a glass of wine and takeaway on his desk. His assistant
Pierce pops his head in.
MARK
You should leave, I’m just going
over some of the details on the Al
Bashir case.
PIERCE
Absolutely. I think knowledge of
‘problems of breech delivery’ may
be crucial in proving the Sudanese
are using aid money to fund the
SPLM insurgents.
REVEAL: Mark is not looking at his briefs but instead is
studying ‘The Expectant Dad’s Handbook’ and has other
Pregnancy/baby books strewn on his desk. He has been busted.
MARK
When you had Charlie did it all
come naturally? Did you know you
were going to be a good Dad?
Mark, troubled.
PIERCE
All the books in the world won’t
prepare you for what’s about to
happen, but for what it’s worth, I
think you’ll make an amazing
father.
Pierce leaves.

INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. DAY.

Back at the ante-natal class, all the same people, new week.
Today the partners are standing behind their wives as Daisy
demonstrates massage techniques. Every woman has one man
behind her apart from Bridget, who has Mark and Jack, vying
for pole position.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

89

DAISY
And of course massage can have many
benefits throughout pregnancy, can
we name some of them?
Jack’s hand shoots up.
JACK
It can lower stress and promotes
feel-good hormones.
Mark shoots his hand up.
MARK
And to be safe, it should also be
avoided in instances of high-risk
pregnancy for example where there
is a geriatric mother.
Bridget looks slightly put out. Everybody laughs, Mark looks
embarrassed.
DAISY
Right, excellent, someone’s been
reading up. Let’s put some theory
into practice.
A super enthusiastic Jack grabs Bridget, manoeuvres her into
position and takes control.
DAISY (CONT’D)
Take an unclenched fist and begin
at the nape of your partner’s neck.
Jack sets about this and Bridget can’t help but swoon with
pleasure, he’s great at it.
Mark stands awkwardly, pathetically, by the side - the only
person in the place not either massaging or being massaged.
Daisy spots him.
DAISY (CONT’D)
Oh, erm... do you want a go...?
MARK
It’s Mark, I think I’ll probably
leave it to Jack, he seems to have
it covered.
JACK
(Mischievously)
You’re so sweet, that’s why I love
you, pumpkin.
A huge, lumbering, tattooed Neanderthal man looks over to
them and turns to his wife.

Mark is addressing the court.
MARK
My lady, may I please make an
application for leave to appeal in
the case of H.M. Government and
Saddiq Al Bashir. As your Ladyship
is no doubt aware, Mr Al Bashir
lost his case in the court of
appeal and he now seeks this courts
leave to appeal on a point of law
of public importance, namely, the
question of whether permission for
the electronic intercepts of his
phone was lawfully granted by the
Foreign Secretary. As it stands,
the law on intercept warrants lacks
clarity and on our proposed appeal
we shall be inviting your

JACK
Hey buddy why are you so angry?
MARK
You know what? I’m really not your
buddy, I don’t know about vibes or
negative energy or prenatal wind
and even less about algorithms and
automated reasoning, so I’ll admit
that I struggle to understand the
laws of attraction especially when
I apply them to myself. Bridget
just defies comprehension
generally. But despite, or perhaps
owing to, the bewildering litany of
catastrophes I’ve witnessed over
the last forty years, I feel I know
her rather well and have spent
every one of those years caring for
her very deeply. In doing so I may
be going expressly against my own
better judgment but there’s nothing
I can do about it.

(CONT’D)
JACK
Do about it? You could try being
around a little instead of saving
the world by cell phone. I make her
feel happy, Mark.
MARK
And I suppose your algorithm tells
you that you and Bridget are
destined to be together, does it?
JACK
Actually it does, and the fact that
you have been trying and failing to
make it work with each other for
the last ten years should tell you
that maybe you are not.
This hits Mark hard. Jack relents.

You know those disastrous dolphin

Bridget back reading the letter. She looks at an enclosed
cheque, indignant.
MARK(V.O.)
A financial contribution would seem
to me appropriate. Should you have
any practical needs, you need only
alert my office. I wish you every
happiness for the future. Mark.
The cheque falls to the floor.
She walks up to the African chart, zones in on Darcy’s name,
with tears rolling down her cheeks. She strokes her bump.

NEANDERTHAL GUY
Ahhh, shame. They seemed so

EXT. GREENWICH PARK. DAY.

138

Shazzer sits with Bridget on a bench. In the background Jack
is holding Shazzer’s children’s attention with his animated
retelling of a fairy-tale.
SHAZZER
How do you orchestrate such cliffhangers in your life?
BRIDGET
Well thanks for that. I hadn’t
thought of it like that.
SHAZZER
I can’t believe Mark ducked out
again.
BRIDGET
Well the last time wasn’t really
his fault.
SHAZZER
(looking at Jack)
I suppose we better just hope it’s
Jack’s, right?... let’s face it,
things could be worse, he is pretty
fucking amazing.
Jack holds out an apple, overacting as a Wicked Queen. The
children and Tom are enthralled. Shazzer’s nose slightly
turns up.
BRIDGET
He definitely seems to be, I don’t
really know anything about him.
SHAZZER
How much do you need to know? He’s
gorgeous, he’s richer than god and
has a very nice sized puppet.
BRIDGET
He does, and we match up very well
on paper. In some countries they
just make you marry a boy in the
next village because his Dad has a
nice horse, and those marriages
seem to work.
SHAZZER
Exactly... And he’s certainly
enthusiastic.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

98

Shazzer says this like it’s a negative.
Jack is now juggling the apples, the children are rapt.
BRIDGET
(Pensive)
Right. I suppose he is.
SHAZZER
I mean, it’s difficult, but you
just have to ask ‘can I see myself
growing old with him’? Sending the
kids off to school, teaching them
how to swim, how to drive their
first yacht?
Bridget laughs.
BRIDGET
How do I know? I don’t know
anything about him, he may wear
socks with sandals when he goes on
holiday. What happens then?
SHAZZER
For that? Divorce. But you have to
have faith. Nobody knows what life
has in store. You know, look at me
and Fergus. When we met he had a
record deal and exciting plans, I
had the great career in journalism.
Now me and the kids are off next
week accompanying him on a tour of
pub back rooms in the Shetland
Islands, living in a fucking camper
van. I’m just saying when it comes
down to it, when you are stuck
holding the baby and it’s pissing
with rain, is that the man you want
to be in a camper van with?
BRIDGET
I suppose he is a billionaire, so
it will be a fucking nice camper
van.
Jack rushes over and takes a cupcake out of Bridget’s hand
and replaces it with the apple.
JACK
Watch that blood pressure Bridge.
Let’s go with nature’s candy. Right
little fella?
He talks into Bridget’s belly. Shazzer slightly raises her
eyebrows. She turns to Bridget.
SHAZZER
I’m sorry I’m not going to be here,
Bridge.

A pensive Bridget, looking a bit breezier is walking along a
street, shopping for the baby.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
Shazzer was right, I had landed on
my feet, with an amazing man who
was happy to be with me. He ticked
every box. The only thing that was
going to get in the way of this was
me...

INT. BRIDGET’S FLAT. SPARE ROOM. DAY.

140

Jack’s been decorating Bridget’s spare room for the nursery a half-finished, black and white pattern on one wall.
Bridget, shopping bags in hand, enters the room to find Jack
painting.
She stops for a while, silently watching him.
JACK
Oh, hey! For the first few months
they can only see black and white.
This will stimulate his spatial
awareness.
BRIDGET
Right. It’s actually making me feel
a bit sick.
JACK
So much better than the floating
pizzas.
REVEAL - Bridget has been painting on the other wall.
BRIDGET
They were teddy bears. But thank
you.
JACK
Well my Mom put Captain Caveman
wallpaper on my wall when I was a
baby. You can imagine how much that
traumatized me.
He starts to do the voice... He stops, no recognition. There
is a moment of silence.
BRIDGET
I bought him one of those bouncy
chairs, I’m not even sure where
we’re going to put it.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

JACK
Yeah, about that. It’s kind of
cramped in here, don’t you think?
BRIDGET
Cosy.
Jack pauses, readies himself for something big.
JACK
I was thinking, maybe it might be
nice if we moved in together?
This hits Bridget hard.
BRIDGET
Do you think we’re ready for that?
JACK
Of course. I’m tired of living in
hotel rooms, and airport lounges.
We could be a family, you, me, him.
What do you say?
There is a long beat - Bridget trying to makes sense of
things.
BRIDGET
What if it isn’t yours?
JACK
What?
BRIDGET
What if the baby turns out to be
Mark’s? What will you do then?
He pauses a moment too long.
JACK
I mean, obviously that would change
things...
BRIDGET
I see.
There is a very long beat.

JACK
And is that what you want? For it
to be Mark’s?
This time Bridget pauses a moment too long.
BRIDGET
I don’t know what I want.
Jack takes a deep breath.
JACK
Are you in love with him?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

101

BRIDGET
I have been.
JACK
And me?
BRIDGET
I don’t know...I could be, one day.
JACK
Bridget, I’ve not been entirely
honest.
Bridget looks at him.
JACK (CONT’D)
Mark thinks the baby isn’t his. I
let him believe it was
mine...that’s why he disappeared.
BRIDGET
Why would he think that?
JACK
Because I let him. You blind-sided
me Bridget, with the chance to have
a family. I didn’t want to lose
you. We can be good for each other.
Ninety seven per cent, remember.
She drops her bags.
BRIDGET
Yes, on paper, and we might even be
having a baby together, but falling
in love doesn’t happen on paper.
Sometimes it doesn’t make any sense
at all. Sometimes you love a person
for all the ways they are not like
you. Sometimes you just love a
person because they feel like home.
She looks at him, in shock and confusion. She picks up her
phone.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
I need to find Mark.
(into phone)
Pierce? It’s Bridget. I’m trying to
get hold of Mark.

She listens, then looks hopeful.

CHASING PAVEMENTS by Adele plays.
Bridget marches back towards her house, still reeling from
what she’s seen. She steps off the curb, not looking when a
car screeches to a halt. BEEEEEEEEEEP. Bridget steps back and
looks down to her bump. It’s a wake up moment.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
And that was the moment I decided
to stop. Stop trying...
....to force everything to be like
everyone thought it should be. Like
I thought it should be.

Bridget walks over to the African Village drawing, and
crosses out Jack, then Darcy.

Taking the place of Christmas decorations is a ‘Pamela Jones

Ah, you’re here. Are you OK?
He gives her a huge hug - just what she needed.

INT. MUM AND DAD’S HOUSE. DAY

She enters - takes stock of the party, is clearly surprised.
DAD
Mum’s throwing a combined Christmas
party stroke political rally. It’s
like the G8 summit in there, but
with pigs in blankets.
Mum spots Bridget and rushes across eyes wide with
excitement.
BRIDGET
I’m sorry, I didn’t realise
everybody would be here, I don’t
want to derail your campaign, I can
just sneak upstairs.
MUM
Nonsense. Look Una had all the
leaflets and posters re-printed,
you’ve inspired me.
The slogans on the wall now read...
‘TOLERANCE is not a four letter word, but PREJUDICE is a four
letter word.’
‘Pamela Jones - Supports Single Mothers, minorities, the
majority of homosexuals, Italians.’
BRIDGET
Wait, still reading, still so long.
MUM
You were right darling as it turns
out, this place is teeming with
single mothers, single fathers,
bisexuals, surrogates and they are
all lovely and so normal.
Bridget smiles.
MUM (CONT’D)
Family values aren’t just about two
married parents anymore, Bridget.
I’ve even got two homosexuals on
the team.
Jeffrey and Graham wave.

MUM
I am very proud of you darling, you

work it’s you. That child is the
luckiest boy on earth to have you
as his Mum. He’ll have all the
support, protection and love of a
million fathers as long as you are
by his side.
Bridget melts. Just what she needed. Dad looks across and
smiles warmly at her.
MUM (CONT’D)
Now come on, we’ve got some
campaigning to do.
Mum grabs Bridget and starts escorting her through the crowd.
MUM (CONT’D)
Make way! Make Way! Pregnant single

Bridget, minus the two men, at a scan. Dr Rawlings gives her

Bridget musters a half hearted smile. Dr Rawlings detects the
sadness.
DR RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
You don’t need them, you know. All
they’re really useful for is
fitting car seats and blaming
things on. They just get in the
way. You can do this on your own
you know. I did. Next time I see
you, we will be in the delivery
room.
Bridget smiles. The baby’s image appears on screen. Bridget,
spellbound, by the fully-formed little being.
She looks to her belly. The camera follows her gaze and
continues INSIDE as the baby moves around, growing. A life
forming all on its own.

Bridget sits in the gallery. The new-look, crowd-sourced news

press conference on the street.
POONANI MEMBER
This is a great victory for free
speech. We must thank one person
who was prepared to fight for us

ON SCREEN: The Poonani girls lifting up their t-shirts in
unison revealing WE LOVE YOU MARK DARCY, QC scrawled across
their bare breasts. The crowd roars.
The camera swings to Mark Darcy smiling awkwardly.
The screen, now bearing Mark Darcy’s image, freezes.
Bridget distracted. Her assistant nudges her.

On balance I would suggest ‘can’t’

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIOS. BOARDROOM. NEXT DAY.
Alice sits at her desk opposite Richard and Bridget. The
front pages of the newspaper reads “So long Lu Tong!”.
RICHARD
It’s actually illegal to fire
somebody for being pregnant.
ALICE
I’m not firing her for being
pregnant. I’m firing her for gross
incompetency.
RICHARD FINCH
Bridget’s the beating heart of this
show, why would you fire her?
ALICE
How about for interviewing a
chauffeur instead of a General,
publicly insulting the CEO of the
London Media Show, using a TV
interview to determine if a guest
might be the father of her child
and being responsible for broadcast
of 36 bare arses.
BRIDGET
It’s okay Richard. I was going to
quit anyway.
(to Alice)
Believe it or not, I was it like
you when I started here, a bit
chunkier maybe, and with less make
up. I was going to make my mark
too. But I can’t be part of your
“re-branding”. I haven’t got the
right haircut, and I don’t drink my
cocktails out of jam jars or put
photos of my lunch on instagram. It
might be old fashioned to want to
make something worthwhile but I’d
rather be old fashioned and
unemployed than be part of a show
that celebrates the inane.
Alice and her acolytes look at each other, shocked.

Maybe when my son is old enough to
understand, integrity will be
fashionable again. Good luck and

She fumbles in her purse, and manages to rustle up £29.60.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)

She starts to hand back some of the items, one by one,
reluctantly. The unhealthy ones first. The cashier de-scans
them until the total is down to £27.60.

This is really happening, I’m going
to be a mother, Mark. Have I left
it too late...?
Before Mark can answer Gianni pipes up.
GIANNI
Do not worry about the age, there
was a woman in my country, she was
65 when she...
BRIDGET
YES! I KNOW!
They hit traffic again and come to a stand still.
GIANNI
Is unbelievable, is a bloody
women’s rights march. You know I’m
a big fan of women’s rights.. And
their lefts. Yes Mr Mark? You get
it, their lefts? I talk about their
boobies.

MARK
Oh Christ, it’s those infernal
women.
CUT TO: Hundreds of incensed chanting women on bicycles with
placards block the streets.
BACK IN THE CAB:
MARK (CONT'D)
Hold my hand - squeeze my
hand, hard as you like - not
long now - stay calm actually, not too hard.

BRIDGET
17, 18, 19, 20, 21 -

BRIDGET
22, 23, 24, 25 - they’re coming
quicker - oh my god we need to get
there.
Gianni honks repeatedly on the horn.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Right. We’re getting out. You
ready?
And they step out into the street.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
I don’t think I can walk.
MARK
There’s no need. I’ll carry you.
GIANNI
I come behind with bag Mr Mark.
And there’s a great rush of romantic music as, in true
Officer and Gentleman-style, Mark lifts her into his arms.
BRIDGET
I must be very heavy.
MARK
Nonsense, I don’t feel a thing!
JUMP CUT to ten yards later. Gasping, red-faced, doubled
over, Mark can’t go one step further.
MARK (CONT’D)
Good God, Bridget, you’re immense!
BRIDGET
I can’t help it!
MARK
I think my lung’s collapsed, but
this is not about me.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

117

BRIDGET
Contraction’s starting again! I’m
going to have the baby in the
street!
MARK
Okay, we’ll walk for ten, rest for
ten.
And he hauls Bridget on towards the hospital.
169

EXT. STREETS NEAR HOSPITAL. NIGHT.

169

Mark is still carrying her. Almost on his knees...when Jack,
on his motorcycle, screeches to a halt. He gets off.
JACK
I’ll take it from here!
Darcy hands Bridget over to Jack. He tries to carry her.
JACK (CONT’D)
Holy shit - I think this is a two
man job.
170

EXT/INT. HOSPITAL. LABOUR UNIT. NIGHT.

170

Mark and Jack carry Bridget in through the doors. A MIDWIFE
runs up with a wheelchair.
MIDWIFE
Which of you is the father?
Mark and Jack step forward.
MARK/JACK
(in unison)
I am.
The mid-wife looks confused, but ushers them into the
delivery room.
171

INT. HOSPITAL. BIRTHING ROOM. NIGHT.

171

Bridget is on her hands and knees on the birthing bed. Mark
and Jack simultaneously rub her back. Two midwives busy
themselves preparing the equipment.
DR RAWLINGS enters the room and looks from JACK to MARK, and
smiles knowingly.
DR RAWLINGS
Ah, I was wondering how many
fathers we might get today - full
house! Bingo!
(calm)
OK Bridget, how are we going to do
this? Epidural?

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

118

JACK
You can do this, a positive mental
attitude is stronger than any drug,
think away the pain.
BRIDGET
Bollocks to that. I want everything
- gas, air, injections, morphine JACK
Bridget... Remember your yoga.
BRIDGET
Fuck yoga!
DR RAWLINGS
Couldn’t agree more. It’s supposed
to be relaxing but I spend my
entire time worried that I’m going
to let out a fart. Now, let me have
a look at that cervix of yours.
She lifts up Bridget’s gown and Jack can’t help but get a
look at the ‘action area’. He looks queasy. A blood curdling
scream comes from the woman giving birth in the room next
door.
DR RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
Oh, good!
CLOSE on Bridget’s relief.
DR RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
You’re already at six centimetres
so you can’t have any drugs at all.
BRIDGET
WHAT?
DR RAWLINGS
You’re too far on. Oooh another
contraction.
Bridget winces in excruciating pain. Jack and Mark wince as
Bridget winces.
DR RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
(to Jack and Mark)
I’m not sure there is much to gain
from you being at the coal face, if
I’m honest. My ex-husband said it
was like watching his favourite pub
burn down.
Another huge scream.
MIDWIFE
Maybe dad should go and fetch mum a
cool flannel.
Mark and Jack look confused, unsure which of them should go,
there is a bit of awkwardness then Mark goes to get it.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

119

Mark returns with a cool flannel in his hand, Jack grabs it
from him and places it on Bridget’s forehead, leaving Mark
floundering and annoyed.
MARK
Bu...
JACK
You can do this, just think the
pain away.
As Jack gets closer, gently imploring her to manage the pain,
she lifts her fist and punches him hard in the face, knocking
him down.
JACK (CONT’D)
Motherfuckers!
MARK
Just think the pain away...
Jack nurses his bleeding nose.
BRIDGET
GET OUT! BOTH OF YOU!
Unwilling to infuriate her more, the men share a look and
both go to leave.
BRIDGET CONTINUED
Make it stop, make the pain stop.
(to the departing men)
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
Both men are at the door, look at each other and turn round,
sheepishly making their way back towards the bed.
BRIDGET
It’s too painful! I can’t do this I
just can’t.
CUT TO:
LATER
Bridget lets out a blood curdling scream, she is clearly in
huge pain. Both men simultaneously put out their hands for
support, but as she screams, just as the pain appears that it
might be too much and faced with the choice of the two men in
her life, impulsively, instinctively, she reaches for...
MARK.
Jack sees this and realizes that Bridget has made her choice.
As Bridget clings to Mark, the two men share a look. Jack
gives a conciliatory and defeated nod then quietly,
graciously, withdraws from the room.
Oblivious to this, Bridget continues to squeeze Mark’s hand
with superhuman might. He swallows his anguish and puts his
face in front of Bridget so she can see him.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

120

MARK
You can! You can do it, Bridget!
And we can do it together.
BRIDGET
Really?
Mark nods.
MARK
Look at what life’s thrown at you
already.
As he talks, Bridget grabs his arm and starts to bite into it
- it’s clearly extraordinarily painful, but Mark just grits
his teeth and talks through the agony, barely letting it
register.
MARK (CONT’D)
Christmas jumpers, massive pants,
cheating boyfriends and repressed
men who don’t deserve you. You’ve
turned disasters into triumphs with
your sheer joyful, infectious,
indefatigable lust for life, time
after time in succession. You’ve
managed your pregnancy almost
entirely alone whilst having to
deal with two juvenile men, a
lunatic mother
and...P...P...Poonani!
He finally said it! She bites down harder. Mark conceals the
pain.
MARK (CONT’D)
This is just the last few moments
and at the end of them, you’ll see
your beautiful baby!
BRIDGET
And what if the baby isn’t yours?
What if he’s Jack’s?
MARK
(no hesitation)
Then I will love him anyway. Just
like I love you, just the way you
were; the way you are; and - no
doubt - the way you always will
be...
Bridget looks at Mark through the red haze. He’s making
sense. Then the next pain is upon her and she bows her head
to it.
She takes her teeth out of his now bloody arm, teethmarks
apparent. He turns his back to her and lets out a massive
silent scream.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

121

DR RAWLINGS
You should probably go and get
those seen to. I’ll handle it from
here.
She ushers him out.
DR RAWLINGS (CONT’D)
Honestly... ‘think the pain
away’... absolute nonsense, you’re
squeezing out another human, I’d
love to see them ‘think it away’.
You’re doing brilliantly, Bridget
and you’re nearly there BRIDGET
I can’t DR RAWLINGS
(firm)
Yes, you can actually, and I think
you know it.

INT. GRAFTON UNDERWOOD VILLAGE HALL. NIGHT.

It’s the night of the election, and the recount has gone on
late into the night. Mum is on stage, next to all the other
candidates, awaiting the results. Una stands next to her.
UNA

A formal looking official clutching a piece of paper
approaches the microphone. Mum - tenses then braces herself.

DAD
It’s about the baby.
OFFICIAL
Ladies and Gentleman, I hereby

Mum leans over to whisper in his ear. The mic picks it up.
MUM
I’m so sorry, you will have to
excuse me. We’re about to become a
grandmother!
There are cheers from her supporters and she scurries off the
stage, pushing Una forward as she goes.
MUM (CONT’D)
I’ll leave you in the capable hands
of my deputy, Una.
Mum and Dad rush out of the hall, leaving the official and
other candidates totally confused.
173

INT. HARD NEWS STUDIOS. NIGHT.

173

Miranda is finishing up presenting the programme.
MIRANDA
And that’s all for this late night
special edition of Hard News...
She looks up at the control room and Richard Finch is fist
pumping the air. He shouts into his headset.
MIRANDA (CONT’D)
Except to say, Bridget Jones is in
labour.
Alice Peabody lets out a small, but discernible, smile.
174

INT. HOSPITAL. LABOUR UNIT. EARLY MORNING.

174

The injured men sit next to each other, heads between hands,
slumped, exhausted, both bandaged from their Bridget-induced
wounds.
JACK
She’s pretty amazing, isn’t she?
MARK
Formidable, always has been.
JACK
Listen, I owe you an apology. I
know I haven’t behaved very well in
all this.

MARK
It’s okay.
CUT TO:

LATER

174A

It’s early morning after what has clearly been a long night.
Jack and Mark are fast asleep in the waiting room chairs.
Jack’s head resting on Mark’s shoulder. Suddenly there is a
huge cry like a great lion’s roar. They wake up with a start,
and whirl round to look at the door. Seconds later, the mewl
of a new-born babe.
175

INT. HOSPITAL. BIRTHING ROOM. EARLY MORNING.

175

Bridget is on the bed. The midwife is standing beside her and
Dr Rawlings watches on, happy.
The sudden cessation of pain has flooded her body with
endorphins and she is in a blissful state. In her arms, a
naked baby, still attached to the umbilical cord, yells
lustily. Bridget looks up at the haggard faces before her.
BRIDGET
We did it! Say hello to our
beautiful boy!
Jack embraces Mark and kisses him. Mark almost kisses him
back, then stops himself.
Mark rushes to Bridget’s side and for a moment they both look
down at the mite in her arms, the perfect, everyday miracle.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Let’s tell everyone.
MARK
Why don’t you tell them yourself,
they’re all here.
He opens the door and Jude, Shazzer and Tom pop their heads
in blowing kisses and congratulating her. Bridget smiles at
them, so happy.
176

INT. HOSPITAL. LABOUR UNIT. BRIDGET’S ROOM. DAY.

176

Bridget cradles the baby, who is now washed and swaddled and
quite simply the most beautiful thing ever. One by one, the
friends rush in.

CLOSE on Jude.

124

JUDE
So sorry, I’m late Bridge, some
Lesbians are having a stupid all
night march.
MARK
Actually they’re marching in aid of
freedom of speech, it’s a rather
important...
Shazzer rushes in.
SHAZZER
Bridge - I can’t believe I wasn’t
here - there’s some unbelievably
annoying march...
BRIDGET
Don’t worry. I would only’ve
punched you as well.
MARK
Actually, the march is rather...
Tom rushes in.
TOM
Can I be Godfather?
BRIDGET
I’m depending on you.
They all clasp hands tightly. The vignette is interrupted by
a loud speech.

MUM (O.S.)
Bridget Jones! My daughter! She’s
my daughter! Where is she?
The thundering of blue heels as Mum approaches. She is
ushered in. Everyone else draws back.
MUM (CONT’D)
So sorry we didn’t get here on
time, there is some march for
women’s rights. Honestly, do we
really need any more rights?
Mum, tearful and overjoyed all at once, kisses Bridget
wherever she can get at her.
BRIDGET
Meet your grandson, Mum.
MUM
Grandson! My grandson! Say hello to
new Parish Councillor Jones.
Bridget beams at them both.

SHOOTING SCRIPT.

125

MUM (CONT’D)
Oh - the darling! He looks so like oh. Not that it matters, but do we
know who Daddy is yet?
Everyone turns to look at the men - Mark with a bloodboltered bandage on his forearm and Jack, not looking rich at
all with a wodge of loo-paper up his nostril. Dr. Rawlings
bends a finger at the two of them.
DR. RAWLINGS
Come along, you two. Time for a
little test, so exciting, it’s like
the final of X Factor. Phone in
adding an 01 for Mark or an 02 if
you want it to be Jack.
Mark and Jack look at each other. They shake hands.
MARK
Good luck.
JACK
(gravely)
And to you, my friend.
CLOSE on Bridget - still high on her endorphins, regarding
Mark with love and Jack with affection.
Back on the men as they turn to her - FREEZE on their faces.
Over this, the sound of a baby’s laugh. The best sound in the
world, in fact. It laughs and laughs.
A caption comes up: ONE YEAR LATER.

INT. CHURCH. DAY.

178

Bridget Jones, finally a bride, enters at the back of the
church on dad’s arm, smiling, nervous.
She walks down the aisle passing Miranda, Richard, the
friends, Una, Mum, Dad and other friends and relatives.
Bridget arrives at the altar. Jack steps forward.
JACK
(to Bridget)
You look beautiful.
She smiles. Jack steps aside - to REVEAL - Mark Darcy.
MARK
We’re really doing this.
On the congregation smiling, happy.

And he throws the laughing boy even higher.
X (O.S.)
Y, what are you doing with my son?
X and Bridget approach hand in hand Y
Don’t leave me alone with him
again. I’ve no idea what I’m doing.
BRIDGET
Come on. We’ll be late for lunch.
The two men lift the baby up and join Bridget. She takes the
baby and gives him a big smacker.
BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Alright then, William X X.
Hashtagletsdothis!
Bridget takes a moment to survey the scene. It is a motley
crew and no mistake.
She watches as X walks ahead, chatting animatedly with Y.
BRIDGET (V.O.)
Dear Diary, and so I Bridget Jones
am a singleton no more... married?
Yes. Finally. Smug? Maybe just a
little.

Bridget swipes a glass of champagne, knocks it back.
On a nearby park bench, a newspaper flaps in the breeze. The
newspaper headline reads: “AIRPLANE FOUND IN BUSH ONE YEAR
LATER. PUBLISHING PLAYBOY MIRACULOUSLY ALIVE”. A photograph
shows a bearded Daniel Cleaver standing surrounded by several
gorgeous Aboriginal women.
THE END.
