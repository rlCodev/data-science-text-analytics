MEREDITH
It's not us. It's them ... THEM and
their stupid boy penises. They didn't
tell me they had a wife. They didn't
give any warning before they broke

CRISTINA
It isn't that Burke broke up with

MEREDITH
Because when you waited two months
to tell me about her, when I had to
find out by her showing up
physically, all leggy and fabulous
and wearing six inch heels, and
telling me herself -- you pulled the
plug. I'm a sink with an open drain,
okay? Anything you say runs out.
There is no enough. This sink can't

PARAMEDIC
Male, 55, victim of head-on collision.
GCS 3 with a depressed skull fracture
and multiple internal injuries.
ACLS protocol started but his veins
blew - so we've been pushing meds
down the tube. PEA in the field.
BAILEY
How long•s he been down?
PARAMEDIC
We've been doing CPR for twenty
minutes, but it took Fire twenty to
get him out of the car. He's pretty
much gone.
BAILEY
He's not gone until we say he's gone.
Keep coding.

You want something more, O'Malley?
Get him into a bay and save him.
GEORGE

But he's dead.
And not only that - nurse Olivia is on the code team that's
helping the paramedics get him into a bay.
BAILEY
Did you not hear me? He's not dead
until we say he's dead. What are
the reversible causes of PEA?

Uh ... myocardial infarction, acidosis,
tension pneumothorax, cardiac
tamponade ...

You know what to do, so do it.

Cristina and Alex presenting.

ALEX
Scott Seibert, 18. No fractures or
internal bleeding ... Got pretty lucky.
BAILEY
Recommendation?
ALEX
Keep overnight for observation.
She nods and moves on to Cristina and Lea Seibert's films several different angles. Doesn't like what she sees.

BAILEY
Damn.
CRISTINA
Lea Seibert, 43. Multiple healed
fractures. Here on her clavicle .. .
humerus .. Third and fourth ribs .. .

*

BAILEY
She's either a bull rider or she's
abused.

*

ALEX
Kid said the old man has a temper.
Accident was road rage. He and the
mom had been fighting ... then they
got cut off in traffic and he went
ballistic. Chased the guy - lost
control ...
BAILEY
And killed a man in the process.
CRISTINA
Not the story I got. She made it

BAILEY
Why am I not surprised?
CRISTINA
She has a bad yellowing bruise over
her right kidney, tender to
palpation ... told me she got it from
a fall last week. She's bleeding ....
Cristina points to a dark spot on the film that appears to
be growing out of one kidney.
BAILEY
Perinephric hematoma - should take
care of itself - but we'll keep an
eye on it. She needs bed rest.

CRISTINA
And a shrink.

ALEX
Why don't we just take a baseball
bat to her husband and see if he
likes how it feels?

Meredith enters with Hubble's films and announces:

MEREDITH
It's drugs.
She puts up the films, and we get a better look, now - Bailey,
Cristina and Alex gathering to see:
TEN WHITE ROUNDISH OBJECTS spread through the man's bowel.
BAILEY
Stupid, stupid, stupid. One bursts,
he's dead in five minutes.
(to Meredith)
What do we do?

*

MEREDITH
Umm ... Run his bowel.

*

BAILEY
And that means? Yang?

*

CRISTINA
Running the bowel entails removing
all thirty six feet of intestine
from the body cavity, hand searching
it to find the balloons and then
cutting them out.

Well .... this one's got a face.

Holds the film over it ...
MEREDITH
So does this one.
They all do.

CRISTINA

And, sure enough ... if you look closely, all the white objects
have tiny little porcelain like features.

It's pale and hard. Cirrhotic. They

DOMNER

INT. LEA SEIBERT'S ROOM - NIGHT

A54*

BURKE pauses at the doorway as ... Lea Seibert sits in her
bed. A COUPLE OF UNIFORMED POLICEMEN stand waiting.

*

Lea's looking away, not wanting to do this. And then finally,
she begins talking to them. Giving her statement. Haltingly.
Facing a world that has shifted. A world of necessary
compromise.
MEREDITH {V. 0. )
We define our own limits.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

B54*

Burke heads down the hall, passing Bailey. She's holding
up ... is that a plastic bag full of the Judy heads she got
out of Hubble? She eyes them, regretful. Mourning the waste.

*

MEREDITH {V. 0. )
Sometimes, all we want is a taste.

And tosses them in the trash.

INT. O.R. 1 / GALLERY - NIGHT

Burke enters the gallery.

*

Derek and George work on removing the tumor from the former
donor girl ... a huge victory.
MEREDITH {V. 0. )
Other times, there's no such thing
as enough. The glass is bottomless.
Burke sits down, exhausted. Patricia plops down next to
him, whips out her clipboard and starts talking...

*
*

We move away from them to see...

*

... MEREDITH watching Derek from the far corner of the room.

MEREDITH {V.O.) {CONT'D)
And all we want ... is more.
