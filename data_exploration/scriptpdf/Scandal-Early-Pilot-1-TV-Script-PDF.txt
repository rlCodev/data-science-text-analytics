UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

Posh. Money lives here. A uniformed doorman is signing for
packages while a delivery guy waits. OLIVIA TAYLOR (mid
30s) enters the lobby. Stylish, intense, the kind of woman
who likes being smart more than she does being pretty. If
women swaggered, she'd swagger cause she's badass. But her
face is hidden by sunglasses, her legs aren't on display and
her tits are minding their own business so she's of no
interest to the doorman. He ignores her. He's busy holding
the impatient delivery guy hostage with his stupid story...
DOORMAN
(to the delivery guy)
So I say to the guy, you can complain
all you want, I'm not walking your
damn dogExcuse me?

OLIVIA
I'm supposed to go to-

DOORMAN
Gimme a minute. I'm busy.
(to the delivery guy)
And he says to me, it's your job.
It ain't my job and I tell him so, I
tell him he can go screw himself or
I can go tell his wife he's screwing
the nanny on the 3rd floor. He says
he's sorry. And I look him right in
the eye and say, I can't hear you -you don't talk to me, your money
talks to me. And he pulls out five
hundred bucks andOlivia slams her hand down on the counter.
OLIVIA
HEY. Your dick is really big. This
guy gets it, I get it. So unless
you want to whip it out and show it
to us, do your job and unlock the
elevator for me. I have a busy day.

you want to do dirty things with him. Right now, though,
he's on edge. They head down the hall towards an apartment

HARRISON
I want to be clear. This is not my

...Where two men in expensive suits stand. They look like
polished businessmen. Or stockbrokers. Except for the fact
that they are currently holding guns on one another. Let's
call them OSCAR (40s) and LARRY (50s). They're sweaty,
nervous and there's an ENORMOUS pile of money in neat wrapped
stacks on the table. When Oscar sees Olivia he starts
shouting.
OSCAR

Okay? Now the only person who gets

INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

We're on OLIVIA (late 20s), running.
Olivia, a whipsmart intense girl next door whose inner geek
is often on the outside. We love her immediately because
she reminds us of, well...us. And like I said, Olivia is
running. Olivia is running through the airport. Running
like crazy. Running like her life depends on it.
She's huffing. Puffing. Wearing heels. Sweating like a
pig. Cause she's not a runner. She doesn't even go to the
gym. She's DYING but she's GOTTA run. She's holding a
boarding pass. She's dragging a rolling suitcase, she's
dodging vacationers and babies and flight attendants, she is
doing her best to keep up with...
HARRISON (late 20s), so delicious and athletic and rough and
tumble that it hurts us not to have him in our own beds,
running ahead of her. The easy fast strides of a sprinter.
Not breaking a sweat. He's a gazelle.
He pauses, circles
back around, grabs her suitcase for her. But Olivia stops
running. Bends over, hands on knees. Wheezing. A turtle.
Or an antelope. Something that isn't made to run.
OLIVIA
...should...work...out...
Olivia looks like she's going to die. Literally die.
Harrison reaches out an arm, grabs Olivia around the waist
and plucks her off the ground. Keeps running towards their
gate. Olivia's arms flop around. He keeps running. Ignoring
her humiliation.

We're in Chicago now but it doesn't matter. We could be in

her laptop. The door opens; Harrison gets in beside her.
He's got two coffees, gestures to the driver to go. Holds a
hand out in front of Olivia's mouth. Waiting until...she
spits her gum into his hand. He makes a face cause even

decisions. Right now, he's staring at them, assessing.
Looking like he smells something bad.

You understand that you're only here

Marty, you don't even get in the

a crisis manager is meeting with
guys in suits like you. Guys who
need me, only they don't know they

because you are screwed. And your
client, he's really screwed because
he's got a guy in a suit working for
him who doesn't know how to find his
ass with two hands and a flashlight.
That would be you. Me? I know what
to do. And I'm happy to start doing
it. Right now. All you gotta do is
hire me. I know you don't like us,
I can tell you don't like us and
also I just made the two hands and a
flashlight comment so...clearly.
But I don't like you either. That
doesn't matter. If I'm good at what
I do, you'll never have to see me
again. And I am. Very good at what
I do. And by the way, Marty didn't
