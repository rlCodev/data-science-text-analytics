EXT. PICK-UP, MOVING THROUGH A BOSTON SUBURB - DAY

1

A car stereo plays a song from the 1980s...
‘IT’S RAINING AGAIN’ BY
SUPERTRAMP (FOLLOWED BY
COMMENTARY FROM THE D.J., WHO
SAYS THAT HE’LL SOON BE
SPEAKING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FROM
THE FOURTH DISTRICT OF
MASSACHUSETTS)
A perfectly-restored Ford pick-up with some vintage objects
in the bed drives slowly along a street lined with modest but
gracious two-storey houses. The only people passing by at
this time of day are a group of elderly power-walkers,
swinging tiny weights.
The pick-up stops in front of a lawn that is badly in need of
a trim. The radio cuts off and WILL emerges. He’s forty-five;
average-looking. He pulls a shoulder bag and then two stuffed
Whole Foods shopping bags from the passenger seat. When he
kicks the truck’s door shut we see a sign: “SECOND HAND VINTAGE SHOPPING ONLINE www.secondhand.com”

INT./EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY

2

Will enters through the kitchen door without knocking. He
puts down the bags and announces his presence with forced
good cheer:
WILL
Mom? It’s me! You ready? Jane’ll be
here any minute. I made a cake for
Dad, hazelnut and carrot. No butter
or sugar, so you can have a slice!
No answer. Will starts to explore various rooms.
WILL (CONT’D)
Where are you guys?
It’s a cozy, slightly messy house. There’s a living room with
a fireplace, a big library. Will collects an open book and
shelves it, then folds a shirt that’s been tossed on a chair.
He opens the door to the master bedroom. The bed is unmade.
His father John’s study. The roller desk is piled high with
books and papers. There’s a big old desktop computer right in
the middle of it all.

Scene 2

Page 2.

On the shelves of a large bookcase that is cluttered with
essays and books, there’s an old Remington typewriter John
used to work with, its beautiful keyboard like a sculpture.
Will emerges from the front door onto the porch, turning off
the phone in frustration. He scratches his head. An elderly
lady in gardening attire stands in the yard next door. It’s
LILLIAN, the neighbor. She’s gray-haired, friendly:
LILLIAN
Will! How are you?
WILL
(approaches her)
Hey, Lillian.
LILLIAN
(whispers)
I’m glad I caught you alone. I
wanted to tell you that if you guys
get busy with Ella in the hospital,
I’d be more than happy look in on
John.
WILL
But they’re not here! Mom and Dad the house is empty!
He redials. Lillian gives him a curious look.
WILL (CONT’D)
(grumbles)
Why’d we even buy her that damned
phone? She always turns it off.
LILLIAN
Come to think of it, I heard
someone turning on an engine this
morning. Very early.
WILL
What motor? Dad’s car’s right here.
He points to a perfectly-maintained old Chevy in the open
garage. And then he realizes the large covered carport is
open.
Oh my god!

WILL (CONT’D)

He’s white as a ghost. He runs toward the carport. Lillian’s
also shocked. She murmurs:

Scene 2

Page 3.
LILLIAN
I can’t believe this.

Will frantically dials and impatiently awaits an answer:
WILL
Jane! Mom and Dad are gone! And can you believe it? - so is the
Leisure Seeker!

EXT. THE ROAD, SUBURBS - DAY

A 1970s Leisure Seeker camper moves through morning traffic.

EXT/INT. CAMPER, MOVING, SUBURBS - DAY

And here they are: ELLA and JOHN. He’s got a white beard and
wears glasses with progressive lenses. He looks like he’s
totally absorbed in his driving. Every so often he shoots a
look at Ella, who uses her gaze to encourage and direct him
which way to go, while also keeping an eye on a map spread on
her lap. She has a small, golden purse on her knee, from
which she occasionally pulls a tiny mirror to check her
appearance.
THE RADIO IS TURNED ON LOW:
TRAFFIC INFORMATION, WEATHER,
POPULAR SONGS
ELLA
Take a right. Here. Exactly. Very
good.
John follows orders with a mysterious calm. Ella watches him
closely.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Couldn’t you have worn something
more comfortable to travel in?
He’s wearing a checkered shirt under a tweed jacket. A linen
handkerchief protrudes from his breast pocket. She leans
closer and sniffs.
ELLA (CONT’D)
And I think you’ve exaggerated a
bit with the eau de cologne. Though
you do smell nice.

Scene 4

Page 4.

John smiles agreeably, but something tells us that he’s not
really grasping what he’s being told. He sniffs the air as
the camper’s interior fills now with the sound of:
THE RONETTES SINGING ‘BE MY
BABY’
He finally speaks:
Darling?

JOHN

Eyes on the road, he waits until he has her attention.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Did you fart?
Excuse me?

ELLA

JOHN
(with pleasure)
You did!
ELLA
(scandalized laugh)
What are you talking about? You
can’t say that!
But she also sniffs the air, then cranes her neck to look
between the seats - there’s a wisp of smoke coming from the
engine’s trap door.
She leans forward to pull a rug from beneath her feet. She
places it over the leak.
He glances at her, but soon loses interest and looks back at
the road ahead.
They’re passing through a leafy suburb filled with banners
and signs from the 2016 campaign. A bus full of school kids
passes; some of them point and make faces.
Ella waves to them through the window.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Hello! Hi! Such beautiful
children... you can go now, hon.
The street’s clear. John? Go! Put
that old engine to work!
Yessir.

JOHN

Scene 4

Page 5.

John accelerates, turning right onto an on-ramp for the
interstate. A red gasoline light goes on, accompanied by a:
BEEP
ELLA
Do we need gas, hon?
JOHN
We need gas?
Ella checks the gauge and then glances at the map on her lap.
ELLA
Let’s stop at Stuckey’s, okay? Like
we used to. We could get a Pecan
Log.
Where?

JOHN

ELLA
Our Stuckey’s, hon. Come on, try to
remember.
JOHN
Okay, boss. We’ll do just as you
say. Like always.
Is he looking for a fight? She blows him a raspberry. Then
she laughs.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Why are you laughing?
ELLA
Nothing. Just drive.

EXT. STUCKEY’S - DAY

5

The Leisure Seeker cuts across oncoming traffic, causing cars
to swerve and horns to sound. It pulls up to a gas pump.
Two attendants approach. They are both Middle Eastern in
appearance; around thirty years old. They act like a married
couple. The FEMALE ATTENDANT washes windows while the MALE
ATTENDANT starts to pump gas. Meanwhile, Ella stares at the
station’s boarded-up windows.

Scene 5

Page 6.
ELLA
Is the store closed? We really
wanted one of your delicious Pecan
Logs.
MALE ATTENDANT
(accent)
Opening soon. Just gas now.
ELLA
No, I can’t believe it. You hearing
this, hon?

John nods, imperceptibly, although he doesn’t seem much
interested. So Ella makes friends with the attendant.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Every summer we’d head south, and
we always stopped at Stuckey’s.
Jane and Will - the kids - they’d
make us stock up on Pecan Logs.
MALE ATTENDANT
Yes, I see.
ELLA
We were visiting my family in South
Carolina. That’s where I’m from.
John, on the other hand, he’s a
real Yankee. Born and bred.
Ah, okay.

MALE ATTENDANT

He exchanges a puzzled look with the Female Attendant, who,
after finishing the windshield, walks away grinning.
ELLA
They were lovely trips. Right,
John? I guess I’m just a natural
born tourist. I love to travel.
Smoky Mountains, Six Flags,
Williamsburg... you ever been to
any of those places?
MALE ATTENDANT
We are from Syria.

Scene 5

Page 7.
ELLA
Well, they’re amazing. You should
take the family. Do you have
children?

The man’s face darkens momentarily with sadness. But he
overcomes it.
MALE ATTENDANT
That’ll be ninety-one dollars,
ma’am.
Certainly.

ELLA

She pulls money from her purse and leans out the window to
hand it to him. As she does, she quietly confides:
ELLA (CONT’D)
John is a much more sophisticated
tourist than me. Oh, he likes to
travel, but he thinks travel should
broaden the intellectual horizons,
whatever that’s supposed to mean...
The attendant pockets the money and gives her a curt nod.
MALE ATTENDANT
Have a very nice journey.
ELLA
Thank you, and I’m sorry if I spoke
too much. I do love to chitchat.
(to John) Let’s roll, hon!
John does as he’s told, putting the camper in gear, but as
soon as they start to move the Female Attendant waves them to
a stop. There’s something in her hand.
6

INT. CAMPER, MOVING - DAY
As the camper rolls down the highway, a satisfied Ella
unwraps the Pecan Log.
ELLA
What a nice woman! She found one in
the storeroom. (She puts on her
reading glasses) Its expiry date
was last April, but it’ll still be
all right, don’t you think? You
want half, hon?

6

Scene 6

Page 8.
(shakes his head)
I want a burger.
ELLA
It’s not lunch time yet. There was
something sweet about that woman.
She had such pretty eyes. Pretty,
but sad. They both did. Don’t you
think, John?

John seems to consider her question, but then, as if saying
it for the first time:
JOHN
I want a burger.
Is his persistence obsessive? Spiteful? Ella sighs, her
cheerfulness vanishing momentarily.
7

EXT. METRO CAFÉ - DAY

7

The Leisure Seeker pulls over next to other vehicles in front
of the Metro Café, a restaurant topped by a big plastic
hamburger sculpture.
8

INT. METRO CAFÉ - DAY

8

CHANTAL
Hi, my name is Chantal and I’ll be
your server!
This is said with great enthusiasm. CHANTAL is a very young
woman, dressed in a company uniform. She hovers over John and
Ella, who are seated in a booth by the window.
ELLA
Hello, Chantal. I’m Ella and this
is John. Looks like you’re stuck
with us!
JOHN
I want a burger.
CHANTAL
Might I recommend the Chow Attack?
Only $9.99. That comes with a
burger, large fries, a slice of
apple pie and a Happy Swirl...

Scene 8

Page 9.

Ella raises her arms to the sky.
ELLA
Happy Swirl! I have absolutely no
idea what that could be, but it
sure sounds promising.
JOHN
I want a burger.
ELLA
Chow Attack for Mr. Grumpy here.
CHANTAL
Okay. And you madam?
ELLA
Just water.
CHANTAL
Nothing to eat?
ELLA
I’ll just have a sip of his Happy
Swirl.
CHANTAL
(puzzled)
Ah, okay. (to John) Would you like
anything else to drink? Pepsi?
Beer?
Burger.

JOHN

ELLA
That will be all.
JOHN
Burger, please.
ELLA
Thank you, Chantal.
Chantal takes their order on a pad, thanks them, and hurries
off. The place is pretty crowded; there are multiple big
screens nearby, one with sports highlights, one where
candidates debate as part of the ongoing campaign, both with
no sound. On another, a music video loudly plays...
...A TECHNO DANCE TRACK

Scene 8

Page 10.

Ella notices a payphone by the counter. She turns to John,
looks in his eyes and speaks forcefully.
ELLA (CONT’D)
I’m gonna stretch my legs. You stay
put.

EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY

9

A dejected Will emerges from his pick-up. Lillian, working in
her garden, gives him a questioning look, but he shakes his
head. He walks briskly toward his parents’ front door.
A woman stands on the front porch, talking on the phone.
Will’s older sister JANE.
JANE
I know, Dr. Tomachewski... I’m
fully aware... well, we just have
to be patient... I don’t know what
else to say... we’re just hoping
they haven’t gone too far... okay,
my brother just pulled up. We’ll
let you know if we hear anything.
She hangs up and looks at Will, who:
WILL
I checked all the supermarkets.
Nothing.
JANE
I seem to remember it was your
brilliant idea that they keep that
monstrosity. Not so smart, kiddo.
WILL
There has to be some sort of
explanation...
JANE
They ran away.
WILL
But from who?
And then the phone vibrates and rings in Will’s pocket. He
looks at the number in confusion before answering.
WILL (CONT’D)
Hello? Mom! Where the fuck are you?

Scene 10

INTERCUT - INT. METRO CAFÉ/EXT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - DAY
10
(The screen splits in two?)
ELLA
Will, darling, please don’t use
that language with me.
While speaking on the phone, she does not lose sight of her
husband, still at the table, absorbed by the big screen TV.
ELLA (CONT’D)
You need to calm down. If you raise
your voice again I’ll hang up
immediately.
Jane, who’s come close to hear what’s being said, snatches
the phone from her little brother’s hands.
JANE
Mom, what is this craziness? You
knew I was coming to get you. Why’d
you run away?
ELLA
We’re just taking a little trip,
Jane. We won’t be gone long.
JANE
A little trip? Where?
ELLA
This is something I really needed
to do with your father.
Will, who has put his ear close to the phone, buries his face
in his hands when he hears the word ‘trip.’ He begins to pace
nervously.
JANE
I can’t believe this! We’d decided
everything. Will was going to stay
with Dad...
ELLA
Your father and I didn’t decide a
thing. You and Will and those quack
doctors did that for us.
Will cannot resist. He grabs the phone back from Jane.

Scene 10

Page 12.
WILL
Mother - you are sick!
ELLA
Sick doesn’t quite describe it,
Will. I’m something else
altogether.
WILL
You cannot be doing this. You tell
Dad to turn that jalopy around and
get right back home.

Jane leans toward the phone to say:
JANE
You need your treatments, mother.
ELLA
I’ve had it up to here with their
treatment. I’ve been there, I’ve
done that, it wasn’t pretty.
WILL
They just want to make you better.
ELLA
Kids, try to understand. Let me
have this vacation with your
father.
Vacation!
vacation?

WILL
What do you mean,

JANE
Mom, you know full well that Dad
can’t drive in his condition.
ELLA
Your father’s perfectly capable of
driving. He’s doing very well.
Ella sees that Chantal has delivered their food, and John is
energetically telling her something.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Kids, we’ll manage. We love you.
She hangs up and moves back to the table, where John now
harangues an intimidated Chantal.

...

JOHN
(talking on all cylinders)
(MORE)

Scene 10

Page 13.
JOHN (CONT'D)
and that’s all because his prose is
so seductive you just race across
the surface having a good time
never feeling compelled to look
beneath it at the profoundly
intricate construction Hemingway
created to support it. Joyce knew
the beauty of it(He looks at Chantal-)
James Joyce? Great, great writer!
You should read him. Irish. He
acclaimed Hemingway. Called him a
giant. But not here, not in
America. Here we praise the hell
out of our brilliant darlings and
then we kill them. Did you read
‘The Indian Camp’? Nick’s dad does
a cesarian with a pocket knife and
sews it up with fishing line and
you see it all. You put the story
down and you suffer an existential
crisis. The realization that who we
are ends, that that's it! So
beautifully crafted. A work of
poetry and it’s prose - it’s prose
that’s poetry!

The waitress nods with a polite smile.
CHANTAL
No, yeah, I can see that.
Definitely.
ELLA
You can just ignore him, you know.
CHANTAL
Oh no, it’s super interesting.
He’s being very nice...
She would like to leave, but John grabs her wrist.
JOHN
Prose that is poetry. That’s
Hemingway’s secret. Do you have
any idea how difficult that is to
do?
For sure.

CHANTAL

Scene 10

Page 14.
ELLA
John, sweetheart, leave the poor
girl alone.

She gently pries John’s hand from Chantal’s wrist.
JOHN
Just don’t confuse his simplicity
with banality. Did you read...
CHANTAL
(moving away)
You want any special sauces with
that burger?
ELLA
Thanks, Chantal, we’re fine.
Enjoy!

CHANTAL

John turns to Ella, who is removing vials with prescription
labels from her purse.
JOHN
I was wondering if she’d read...
ELLA
Eat, John. You want me to cut it up
for you?
John lowers his eyes toward the plate.
JOHN
Not necessary.
He takes a bite.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Don’t forget to take your pills.
Ella remembers; she starts to remove her multicolored pills
from a tiny compartmented container.
ELLA
So how is it?
John nods, raises a thumb.
ELLA (CONT’D)
And now yours.

Scene 10

Page 15.

She hands the box to John, who swallows his pills. She pushes
the glass of water toward him.
ELLA (CONT’D)
I’ll chase mine with this famous
Happy Swirl.
She swallows her daily dose. Blue pills, white pills. She
chases them down with a shot of the frothy drink.
Not bad.

ELLA (CONT’D)

JOHN
(in exquisite reverie)
Or maybe the ‘Hills Like White
Elephants.’ Gosh...
ELLA
I remember that one. The guy’s
telling her to have an abortion,
but your Hemingway never actually
writes the word.
JOHN
Doesn’t need to. Prose that is
poetry. No explanations required.
ELLA
It was always so nice when you read
to me in bed.
11

INT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S KITCHEN - DAY

11

Jane sits in the kitchen with a steaming cup of coffee and a
slice of Will’s cake. He’s still very upset.
WILL
I don’t see how you can just sit
there eating. We should call the
police. And get Andy to track their
credit card spending.
JANE
Hopefully Mom hasn’t lost her
marbles now as well. Maybe they’re
just out for a short spin. I mean,
where’re they going to go?
WILL
The camper needs to be serviced,
Jane. What if there’s an accident?
(MORE)

Scene 11

Page 16.
WILL (CONT'D)
What if someone sues Dad? We need
to figure out where they’re going
and intercept them. (pause) And yet
she continues to eat as if it’s
nothing!

Jane tries to calm her brother.
JANE
Sit down, Will. Let’s think this
through.
At this moment, Lillian opens the door and walks right in.
LILLIAN
Yoo hoo? Any news? Have you heard
anything?
Not yet.

WILL

JANE
Hey, Lillian. Have a piece of
cake. Will really outdid himself
this time. It’s delicious.
WILL
(dejected)
Made without animal fat.
12

INT. CAMPER, MOVING - DAY
The Leisure Seeker rolls down a wide and busy road.
Ella speaks while John drives:
ELLA
... but everybody came to my cousin
Jane’s wedding. Remember? They sat
us at a table by that huge picture
window.
John nods up and down. He cannot find the memory...
ELLA (CONT’D)
Do you remember who was there?

Me.

JOHN
(hesitates, then:)

Ella laughs loudly.

12

Scene 12

Page 16A.
ELLA
Yes, John. You were there and I was
there and the kids were there. I’m
saying who else beside us. You
don’t remember. At our table, there
were Michael’s relatives from
Charlotte, and... LOOK OUT!

Scene 12

Page 17.

She shouts because an SUV has cut into their lane. Ella
braces her feet and closes her eyes, waiting for the impact.
But John brakes in time as he instinctively reaches out an
arm to protect his wife. The camper swerves. Sunglasses, maps
and guidebooks fly off the dashboard. A door slams at the
back of the camper as other objects crash to the floor.
Meanwhile, the SUV accelerates away. The camper steadies.
Jesus!

ELLA (CONT’D)

JOHN
We’re fine.
ELLA
That was amazing, John.
JOHN
I still have it, don’t I?
Showing off, he drives for a moment using just his knees to
steer. She smiles lovingly at him, unconcerned by any
potential danger.
ELLA
Yes you do.
John puts his hands back on the wheel, his eyes on an array
of road signs. One points to Philadelphia and Baltimore.
ELLA (CONT’D)
That way, okay? Old Route 1. You
remember the road? We took it a
thousand times.
JOHN
We’re heading south?
ELLA
That’s the plan.
JOHN
To your people.
ELLA
What people? My parents? They’re
dead, John.
JOHN
They’re all dead. (muttering) Like
the descent of their last end...

Scene 12

Page 18.
ELLA
I wonder if they’re having fun up
there, if it’s a joyous place,
where you sing and dance while
drinking Happy Swirls all day. What
do you think happens, you know,
after? John?

John, incongruously, begins to sing:
JOHN
(whispering)
Freedom's just another word for
nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if
it ain't free, no no...
Ella smiles and joins in the old Janis Joplin song.
ELLA AND JOHN
...And, feelin' good was easy,
Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good
enough for me......
Meanwhile, Ella spots a wisp of smoke coming from the trap
door she earlier covered with the rug.
The Leisure Seeker rolls down the great highway, passing
signs for the Pennsylvania border as they continue to sing:
ELLA AND JOHN (CONT’D)
...Good enough for me and my Bobby
McGee...
13

EXT. CHESTER PARK FAMILY CAMPSITE - DAY

13

The Leisure Seeker idles in front of the reception hut, while
...THE SONG CONTINUES, NOW
SUNG BY JANIS JOPLIN...
We see Ella lean toward the receptionist to deliver documents
and money.
CUT TO:
The Leisure Seeker slowly rolls to a stop between mighty oaks
in front of the lake. Modern campers are parked on either
side.

Scene 13

Page 19.

With well-practiced gestures, repeated many times over the
years, John connects the RV’s electric cable to a big socket,
then firmly fastens the water supply hose.
Meanwhile, inside the camper, Ella leans forward to seal the
leaky trap door with duct tape.
CUT TO:
At their portable picnic table, John eats the sandwiches Ella
has prepared and they both take their medicine.
THE SONG ENDS
14

EXT. CHESTER PARK FAMILY CAMPSITE - NIGHTFALL

14

At dusk, Ella sits at the picnic table, a cardigan draped
over her shoulders, enjoying the cool evening weather.
THE CHIRPING OF CRICKETS
She cranes her neck to see what John’s up to...
... he’s lying on a bench sofa in the dinette, taking a nap.
And then a family returns to a neighboring camper: husband
and wife, a kid, a baby sleeping in its mother’s arms.
Hey! -

NEIGHBORING CAMPERS

ELLA
(friendly)
Hi there!
While his wife puts the children to sleep, the MALE CAMPER
wanders over to admire the old Leisure Seeker.
MALE CAMPER
Whoa, check it out. ‘75 Winnebago
Indian.
ELLA
It was a gift from my parents so
we’d come visit them. Our Leisure
Seeker. My husband hated it at
first - he used to say it was kinda
low class. But he got used to it
in the end. We’ve had a lot of
great trips in this old rustbucket.

Scene 14

Page 20.
MALE CAMPER
Chevy Series G engine.
ELLA
Oh, you’d have to ask John about
all that. Though he’s taking a nap
right now.

The FEMALE CAMPER appears.
MALE CAMPER
Look at this old beauty, babe. So
have you folks been on the road
long?
ELLA
Actually, we just started. We’re
headed south, down to where I grew
up, between Charleston and
Savannah.
FEMALE CAMPER
It’s so beautiful there!
ELLA
Yeah, we’d always go on vacation
there. But this time we’re going
even further south. All the way
down to the Florida Keys.
Wow!

MALE CAMPER

ELLA
I’m finally taking John to
Hemingway’s house in Key West have you ever been?
They both shake their heads.
MALE CAMPER
Now, Hemingway was a Confederate
general, right?
FEMALE CAMPER
No, silly, he was a writer. Didn’t
he commit suicide?
ELLA
Yes. I never understood why...

Scene 14

Page 21.

Ella’s voice trails off. For a moment, she seems deeply moved
and lost in thought, as if she’s only now beginning to
understand why. But then she snaps out of it.
ELLA (CONT’D)
John knows everything about him.
He’s always wanted to see that
house. Every year I’d promise him
we’d go, but, you know how it is
travelling with little kids... of
course we’ve been to Melville’s
place. That’s just a few hours
from our house. Have you been
there? He wrote Moby Dick. It’s
very interesting.
Her neighbors nod, not knowing what to make of all this.
ELLA (CONT’D)
... it was actually a big pain in
the rear for me and Will (she
laughs). My daughter loved it. I
think that’s why she became a
professor. John is so proud of her.
He’s a teacher too.
The neighbors continue to smile, though now they exchange a
look, wondering how to escape this talkative lady.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Poor Will, on the other hand, he’s
still struggling to find his way...
The Male Camper pats his pockets, looking desperately at his
wife - time to go - but then John appears at the door of the
Leisure Seeker, looking groggy, his hair out of place.
JOHN
Where are we? We’re not home.
ELLA
No, honey. We live in
Massachusetts. This is
Pennsylvania.
JOHN
What the dickens are we doing in
Pennsylvania?
ELLA
We’re on vacation. And we’re having
a whale of a time, right?

Scene 14

Page 22.
JOHN
Not me. I want a cup of tea.

He sits next to Ella, who smiles bravely at the neighbors.
ELLA
My husband John. And these are our
neighbors...?
MALE CAMPER
Bob Taylor. And this is my wife
Janette. Hate to say it, but...
FEMALE CAMPER
...it’s a little late...
MALE CAMPER
...uhm, yeah, we need to put the
kids to sleep...
They flee.
MALE CAMPER (CONT’D)
Maybe catch you later...
FEMALE CAMPER
Yes, maybe...
ELLA
I hope so! (hisses to John) Just
say goodbye...
JOHN
I want a cup of tea.
Ella smiles at the neighbors, as if to apologize. After they
close the door, she turns to John in irritation.
ELLA
I’ll make your tea when I’m good
and ready. I’m quite comfortable
sitting here.
JOHN
But I want it now.
ELLA
You’ll just be up peeing all night.
JOHN
(raising his voice)
I want a cup of tea!

Scene 14

Page 23.
ELLA
Lower your voice, mister. We’re not
the only ones here. In fact, make
it yourself. You’re not an invalid.
JOHN
That’s exactly what I’ll do.

Instead, he stays seated, immobile. After a moment, Ella
reaches out to smooth his hair. The gesture placates John,
who asks, gently now, as if he’s just thought of it for the
first time:
JOHN (CONT’D)
What do you say - how about a cuppa
tea?
Ella looks up at the sky, then smiles and sighs as she rises.
I give up.

ELLA

She walks off.
JOHN
(calls to her)
Dodge 440 V8 engine, by the way.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

John and Ella open the bed in the dinette, with coordinated
gestures, as they’ve done so many times. Then John gets under
the covers. Ella sits near him, putting drops into a glass
illuminated by a small light.
ELLA
Here, drink it all.
She gives him two tablets that John chases down with the dropfilled water. And then she caresses him like he’s her child.
CUT TO:
John sleeps noisily back in the darkened camper. Ella sits at
a small table, writing what appears to be a letter on a sheet
of paper. But then she grimaces in real pain. She pops two
blue Oxycodone pills from a blister packet and chases them
down with a swig from a bottle of Canadian Club.

EXT. CHESTER PARK FAMILY CAMPSITE/INT. CAMPER - DAY

16

The Taylor family’s camper starts up and rolls away,
revealing the Leisure Seeker, from which John, still in
pajamas, emerges to check a small water filter on the side of
the camper. He nods, smiling to himself. And then he goes
inside.
Ella was sleeping, for the first time we see her short
haircut post-chemo style. His bustling wakes her.
ELLA
Good morning, Johnny my dear.
She combs out her spectacular wig that has spent the night on
a Styrofoam head on the nightstand, then puts it on.
JOHN
It occurred to me this morning to
replace the water filter, so I did
but I didn’t, amazingly the darn
thing’s still clean as a whistle.
He closes the door; she sits up.
JOHN (CONT’D)
I find myself compelled to admit
this old contraption has its good
points. There are of course, more
elegant ways to travel, but there
is no denying that one sleeps
extremely well in that stupid bed.
How about you, my princess? Did you
sleep well?
John’s speech seems different, more relaxed, less catatonic.
He’s in a good mood. Ella is pleasantly surprised.
ELLA
I’m so happy when you come back to
me.
JOHN
I was just outside.
I’m fine.

Your pain?

ELLA

JOHN
Where are we exactly?
ELLA
Chester County, south of
Philadelphia.

Scene 16

Page 24A.
JOHN
Chester County? Some really
beautiful country around here.
Country imbued with history. It’s
so good to be back on the road
again. I love it. It makes us so
happy. Let’s have some coffee!

Scene 16

Page 25.

Ella watches John as he reaches the coffee machine. But
suddenly he stops and looks around, bewildered. She continues
to watch him, growing worried now.
John?

ELLA

He looks at her, disoriented.
ELLA (CONT’D)
What’s happening?
JOHN
Where are we?
ELLA
(sighs)
It’s so nice when you forget to be
forgetful. Too bad it ends so
quickly. I just can’t get used to
it.
JOHN
What are you saying?
ELLA
Nothing. Let me make the coffee.
You should get dressed, my love.
John smiles at her but does not move. Ella grasps him gently
by the arm and moves him toward the bed.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Come on, slow-poke.

INT. CAMPER, MOVING. DAY.

17

The Leisure Seeker moves down Route 1, passing the skylines
of Baltimore and Washington. The road is ugly here. There are
car repair shops, fast food restaurants, Walmarts and cheap
furniture outlets.
Ella does not like what she’s seeing. She has the map open on
her lap, while John, dressed in a checkered shirt, drives
with his usual absorption.
ELLA
How ‘bout we stop at Old
Chesapeake? The children loved it
and you didn’t mind it so much, did
you?

JOHN

Scene 17

Page 26.

Old what?
ELLA
The historical village in Virginia.
You used to love the museum...
After a moment’s silence John murmurs.
JOHN
Maybe Dan isn’t, after all.
Ella looks at him in confusion.
ELLA
What did you say?
JOHN
He’s not dead, is he?
Who?

ELLA

JOHN
Dan. You want to go to him.
Ella sits in baffled silence.
ELLA
Who the hell is Dan?
JOHN
(very serious)
We’d visit your relatives so you
could secretly meet him.
Ella finally understands what he’s talking about, but is
still incredulous.
ELLA
Oh my God... Daniel Coleman?
She looks at him, expecting more, but he’s fallen silent.
ELLA (CONT’D)
(dumbfounded)
What is going on in your mind?
JOHN
You’re like Gretta.
Who?

ELLA

Scene 17

Page 27.
JOHN
“Yes, the newspapers were right:
snow was general all over
Ireland...”
ELLA
What on earth are you...?
JOHN
“It was falling on every part of
the dark central plain, on the
treeless hills, on the Bog of Allen
and, farther westward, softly
falling into the dark mutinous
Shannon waves...”
ELLA
Here we go again.
JOHN
“It was falling, too, upon every
part of the lonely churchyard on
the hill where Michael Furey lay
buried. It lay thickly drifted on
the crooked crosses and headstones,
on the spears of the little gate,
on the barren thorns.”
ELLA
All right ...
JOHN
“...his soul swooned slowly as he
heard the snow falling faintly
through the universe and faintly
falling, like the descent of their
last end, upon all the living and
the dead.”
ELLA
All right, I get it, that story by
Melville, you don't have to recite
the whole damned thing...
JOHN
James Joyce.
ELLA
I’m glad to know there are at least
some things you remember well.

Scene 17

Page 28.
JOHN
Gretta Conroy. You’re just like
her. You’ve thought of him your
whole life.

Ella can’t believe this is happening. Smiling, she tells him:
ELLA
What on earth are you talking
about? John?
She takes his arm and shakes him. He keeps his eyes on the
road, muttering almost to himself.
JOHN
We’d go to Charleston and you’d
slink off to Savannah. Saying you
were going to see your aunt.
Ella shakes her head, and then bursts into laughter.
ELLA
I can’t believe this. But you
should know, if Daniel Coleman is
alive - and that’s a big if - he’s
been living in Daytona for the past
thirty years.
She closely watches John, who is now driving in silence.
ELLA (CONT’D)
You hear me?
She sighs, then mutters to herself, still in a state of
shock.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Dan Coleman. Honestly. Of all
the...
John, eyes fixed on the road ahead, asks:
JOHN
Ella, where’s my gun?
Ella watches her husband closely.

Scene 17

ELLA
What? We didn’t bring the gun...

John doesn’t answer. Ella’s mind is working: why would he ask
that?

EXT. OLD CHESAPEAKE TICKET OFFICE - DAY

Soldiers in eighteenth-century uniforms raise their muzzleloading muskets and shoot, producing a cloud of white smoke.
John watches the performance. He’s in line behind Ella and
other tourists at the ticket window.
TICKET SELLER (O.S.)
Two people, single day. That’ll be
88 dollars, ma’am.
The young man in the ticket booth, also dressed in 18thcentury clothes, hands Ella a “Citizen Passport”:
ELLA
Goodness, you’ve become pricey!
She reaches for her wallet.
TICKET SELLER
It’s $40.99 per ticket, plus taxes.
ELLA
When we used to come here with the
kids, it was 10 dollars for the
whole family.
TICKET SELLER
When was this? Back when we were a
colony?
ELLA
That’s not a very nice thing to
say.
TICKET SELLER
Enjoy your visit.

Horse-drawn carriages move through a replica 18th-century
village. A military band plays:
YANKEE DOODLE
Ella and John hover near a group of tourists, as a guide
describes (and perhaps exaggerates) the history of the
colony. John lingers in front of a group of African-American
actors portraying slaves. White actors bark orders at them.
Ella wants to drag John away, but he resists, grumbling:
JOHN
This is awful.
ELLA
Darling, come on...
Ella takes him firmly by the arm and leads him toward a group
of tourists entering one of the buildings.
JOHN
(whispers) We have to do something
to stop this outrage...
ELLA
It’s all make-believe...
JOHN
That’s just your southern racism
talking.
ELLA
What utter nonsense! Come on, let’s
go see the library. You used to
love that.
John reluctantly follows her. We notice a young woman with
two young children, a boy and a girl, in the tour group.
JENNIFER. She watches John until she gets up the nerve to
approach him.
JENNIFER
Mr. Spencer?
John looks at her blankly.
JENNIFER (CONT’D)
It’s me. Jennifer Ward. Class of
‘93. How are you?

Scene 20.

Page 31.

Ella interrupts.
ELLA
I’m sorry, Miss, but I don’t think
my husband is able to...
But John perks up before she can finish.
JOHN
Jenny Ward! It’s you! How the devil
are you?
Jennifer is almost overwhelmed with emotion.
JENNIFER
I am so, so happy to see you!
JOHN
How did you get on at Columbia? You
must have graduated by now...
JENNIFER
I can’t believe you remember me.
A surprised Ella follows the conversation.
ELLA
I can’t believe it, either.
JENNIFER
A lot has happened since then.
Michael, Emily, this is Mr.
Spencer, the most inspiring teacher
I ever had.
The boy and girl wave shyly.
EMILY
Hello, Mr. Spencer.
JOHN
What was the name of that friend of
yours?
JENNIFER
Lorna Mitchell?
JOHN
The two of you were always
laughing.
Jennifer is getting emotional as she remembers.

Scene 20.

JENNIFER
(sighs, perhaps a little
bitterly)
Yes, I was. I’m sorry if I’ve
disturbed you. I’m just so happy to
see you.
JOHN
Oh, me too, Jenny.

Me too!

She wanders on ahead with her children. Ella, meanwhile,
stares at her husband in annoyance.
ELLA
(mocking)
Me too, Jenny. You can’t remember
the names of your own children but
you remember that Jenny was always
laughing. I’m speechless. What goes
on in that head of yours?
She takes him away, as he says:
JOHN
She was such a good student.

INT. CAMPER, MOVING - DAY

On the road again. Ella looks tired and achy. She takes her
painkillers from her purse and swallows them with a drink of
bottled water.
John turns to her, worried.
JOHN
You all right?
ELLA
Yes, John. I’m just dandy.
John keeps one eye on the road and one on Ella, as if
studying her.
Ella sighs.
Who am I?

ELLA (CONT’D)

JOHN
What are you talking about?

Scene 21

Page 33.

As he says this he reaches over and touches her, is dear to
her.
ELLA
You’re having one of your moments,
aren’t you?
John gives her a quizzical look.
ELLA (CONT’D)
You know I’m someone dear to you,
but you’re not exactly sure who.
He smiles but doesn’t answer. She persists:
ELLA (CONT’D)
Seriously, John - do you know who I
am?
JOHN
Of course I do.

Goodness me...

ELLA
Who? Who am I? John, tell me who I
am.

JOHN
(laughing)
Give me a second, alright? I’m
thinking.
Ella places a hand on his arm.
ELLA
John, tell me who I am.
JOHN
You don’t know? Well I’ll tell you.
You’re my wife.
ELLA
Very good. But what’s my name?
John continues to look ahead, his eyes on the road, but he
seems uneasy. Ella doesn’t stop looking at him. She’s
waiting. And then it bursts out of his mouth.
JOHN
(snorts)
Goddamnit, will you ever stop with
all these stupid questions - ELLA!
Then, softly repeated.

INT. CAMPER/EXT. SMALL TOWN, SOUTHERN VIRGINIA - DAY

22

Ella had fallen asleep. But then:
THE SOUND OF A HORN
... makes her open her eyes. She realizes that the camper has
stopped at a green light and John is not behind the wheel.
She looks around the interior of the van, dazed and worried.
Outside the window, she can see the modest houses of a small
town. She turns to look through the back window and sees a
line of stalled traffic. Some of the cars go screeching
around her, other drivers are out of their vehicles, cursing
the camper.
ELLA
(murmurs)
Good Lord, where is he now?
Finally she sees him: he’s just reached the sidewalk across
the street. Patrons of a nearby bar come out to watch,
curious, laughing, shaking their heads. John mixes among
them, idly watching the traffic jam like it has nothing to do
with him.
Ella slaps the windshield:
ELLA (CONT’D)
(shouts)
John!
She leans on the horn.
A MALE DRIVER approaches her window.
MALE DRIVER
Ma’am? Do you need some help?

Scene 22

Page 35.

A FEMALE DRIVER has come out of her car.
FEMALE DRIVER
Could I move your vehicle for you?
ELLA
I’m sorry, please, just give me a
minute...
Ella opens the door, gets out and strides across the road.
Everybody’s watching her, enjoying her distress.
Ella reaches John, hissing through clenched teeth:
ELLA (CONT’D)
What are you doing? Come with me,
you fool.
She takes him by the arm and drags him toward the camper,
pushing him back on board, then hurries to get in her side.
By now they are the center of attention. Everybody’s watching
them, laughing.
John is back behind the wheel. But he doesn’t do anything.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Come on, drive! Can’t you see we’re
holding up the whole show?
John looks at the dashboard in profound confusion, as if he’s
never seen anything like this before. The gauges, the knobs,
the lights, the key in the ignition. It might as well be the
cockpit of a 747. He places his hand gently on the steering
wheel, touching it as if it is made of a precious substance.
JOHN
What do I do?
ELLA
Turn on the engine. Come on, John,
concentrate. Just turn the key.
She raises her voice because once again because:
HORNS SOUND
ELLA (CONT’D)
(turns around, shouting)
Just a minute! We’re leaving!
(hisses at John) Please, turn the
key. Get going.

Scene 22

Page 36.
JOHN
Get going?
ELLA
Right. Just relax. You know how to
do this. You’ve always been a
wonderful driver.

But then John takes his hands off the wheel. Ella’s really
worried now.
A car with flashing lights pulls up. A POLICEWOMAN gets out.
She’s pregnant, six months at least. She approaches John’s
side of the camper.
PREGNANT COP
What seems to be the problem?
You’re blocking traffic. You have a
breakdown?
No, ma’am.

JOHN

PREGNANT COP
Okay, then why aren’t you moving?
JOHN
Good point, officer.
John, watched by an astonished Ella, turns the key, starts
the motor and drives off as if nothing’s happened.
An incredulous Ella bursts into laughter.
ELLA
You really are going to drive me
round the bend one of these days...
John, undaunted:
JOHN
Did you see her? That policeman.
She was pregnant!
23

EXT. CAMPSITE, NORTH CAROLINA - DAY

Ella sits at a picnic table scattered with brochures and
maps. Sipping from a bottle of soda, she studies a Florida
guidebook. She turns toward the camper and says in a raised
voice:

Scene 23

Page 37.
ELLA
Hey hon, did you know that
Tennessee Williams had a house in
Key West, too? He’s one of the
writers you really love, isn’t he?
I remember when you took me to the
theater to see that one set in New
Orleans... you hear me, John?

She mutters to herself:
ELLA (CONT’D)
Though I preferred the film with
Marlon Brando. What a dish!
John comes down the camper’s steps, looking alarmed.
Ella?

JOHN
Ella? Where are the kids?

At home.

ELLA

JOHN
We left them at the house? I can’t
believe it.
ELLA
John, please...
Ella understands that John is having one of his “moments.”
JOHN
For God’s sake, what have we done?
We’ve left the children on their
own!
Ella impatiently slams the guidebook on the table:
ELLA
The children are all grown up! It
won’t be long until they’re old.
They have their own lives - they’re
fine.
JOHN
(incredulous)
Seriously?
ELLA
Oh my god. Jane’s married to
Philip, she teaches college.
(MORE)

Scene 23

Page 38.
ELLA (CONT'D)
They’ve got two kids, a boy and a
girl.
Really?

JOHN

ELLA
Yes, John, don’t you remember? Good
heavens. Rose and Stephen.
JOHN
Toddlers, right?
This seems to calm him. He sits next to Ella.
JOHN (CONT’D)
They’re very cute.
ELLA
(sighs) Stephen’s nineteen and Rose
is twenty-one. Don’t you remember
her high school graduation
ceremony? Stephen played in the
band and Rosie made a wonderful
speech. You were very moved by it.
JOHN
Stephen played... Rosie made a
wonderful speech...
ELLA
(hopeful)
So you do remember.
JOHN
No. I don’t.
Now Ella’s really angry.
ELLA
It really hurts me that you don’t
remember things. I’m sick and tired
of having to remember everything
for you.
There’s a profound silence. A mortified John murmurs:
JOHN
Forgive me, Ella.
Ella realizes that she’s gone too far. Now she feels worse
than he does.

Scene 23

Page 39.
ELLA
No, forgive me, my love. I
shouldn’t get angry with you.
JOHN
It’s my damned memory.
ELLA
I know. Come here.

She takes his hand, she strokes his beard. But after several
seconds he again asks:
JOHN
Ella, where are the kids?
Ella sighs and stands.
ELLA
Come on, there’s something we need
to do. I brought along a surprise.
24

EXT. CAMPSITE, NORTH CAROLINA - NIGHT

24

Slightly grainy pictures from a birthday party circa 1972.
Ella, in her thirties, has a kid on her knee who’s in the
process of blowing out three candles.
ELLA
Which one is this, John? Do you
know?
It’s Jane.

JOHN

A slide projector on the picnic table casts images on a sheet
strung between two oaks. Ella and John sit as if they’re at
the cinema. Ella works the control button on her lap.
Other images appear. In one, from 1974, Ella grasps Jane’s
hand as she holds Will in her arms by a river.
ELLA
And where are we in this one?
JOHN
Ella! Look at you!
It’s true: she was very beautiful. It’s also clear that John
loved to photograph her. In many of the photos, the children
are cut off in the frame.

Scene 24

Page 40.
ELLA
Chowan River. That marvelous
camping spot at Catherine Creek. We
could put up our own landmark
there.

Another slide. Here, finally, is John, from thirty years ago;
blurry and slightly crooked, embracing Ella.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Jane took this one.
John smiles. Next comes a photo which depicts a crowd of
Thanksgiving guests. Ella, however, stands apart.
JOHN
You were sad that evening.
ELLA
I remember you telling me to make a
happy face, but I just couldn’t do
it. What year was that?
JOHN
You were sad.
ELLA
Perhaps ‘81. ‘82...
She presses the control switch.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Do you remember these kids?
She’s pointing to a group of boys and girls throwing a party
for John.
JOHN
Your nieces and nephews? Down in
Charleston?
ELLA
No, they’re your students, throwing
you a birthday party. This was your
favorite class... do you remember?
John says neither yes or no, but he continues to closely
study the photo.
Meanwhile curious campers gather around, notably an elderly
couple, who watch Ella’s and John’s life like it was their
own.

barbecues; the happiness and melancholy of an entire life.

THE SONG CONTINUES

Ella and John sleep in each others’ arms. Morning light seeps
through the cracks in the curtains. This is perhaps what
causes Ella’s eyes to fall open. She gently pulls down the
covers and runs her hand along the mattress. John has wet the
bed. Ella shakes him awake.
CUT TO:
She helps him wash with a sponge, and then dry himself with a
towel. Meanwhile:
ELLA
I bought you six new pairs of
boxers - didn’t you see? Why don’t
you wear them?
JOHN
I don’t like them.
ELLA
What do you mean?
JOHN
I don’t like them.

then John wanders off to parts unknown.
Ella shouts after him.

EXT. CAMPER, MOVING/EXT. ALTERNATIVE FARM STAND - DAY
The Leisure Seeker passes through fields of grapevines. It
winds up at a cabin where a young farm couple with an
alternative air about them sell organic grapes and grape
juice.
CUT TO:
John and Ella are sitting at a picnic table, having a
breakfast of grapes. They’re the only customers. They eat
one at a time, in silence, savoring them, as cars race by.
At one point John plucks his handkerchief from his breast
pocket and gently cleans a drop of juice from Ella’s chin.
ELLA
Do you know what I love about you,
John? Your silences are never
embarrassing. Never once in my life
have I thought: now I need to say
something. It’s the thing I’ve
always liked the best about our
trips.
JOHN
So you still see him.
John speaks this phrase abruptly, as if part of an ongoing
conversation. Ella gives him a confused look:
ELLA
What are you talking about?

26

Scene 26

Page 43.
JOHN
You speak with him on the phone.
You write him letters.
Who?

ELLA

JOHN
(chuckles)
Ah, so now we’re pretending like
you don’t know... Dan. You said
he’s living in Daytona now.
Ella starts to laugh again.
ELLA
Dan. Oh, Dan. Susan Sullivan told
us that at Maggie Tate’s funeral.
You were right there beside me!
John does not seem convinced.
JOHN
But you asked about him.
ELLA
What? John, the funeral was ten,
no, fifteen years ago
JOHN
(sad)
All these lies. All these years.
John stands up and goes back into the camper, muttering,
leaving Ella in amazement at the table.
ELLA
John? What are you doing? Get back
here.
The FARM WIFE approaches with a refill. She smiles
sympathetically. Ella feels encouraged.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Can you believe this? He’s
convinced that I still think about
my first boyfriend, who, by the
way, dumped me. But Dan was right.
Things would have never worked
between us. Those were different
times. I was nineteen. Oh, my
lord, what a scandal...

Scene 26

Page 44.

The hippy-farmers nod sympathetically.
FARM WIFE
What happened?
ELLA
Well they sent me to Boston to work
in my Aunt Rosemary’s shop. That's
where I met John, this handsome
young teacher who came every week
to buy a new pair of leather
gloves. Then he came back the next
week to buy another pair - he said
he’d lost them. And then he did it
again. I eventually discovered he
had a house full of them.
Ella wants to be sure that this woman understands her story.
ELLA (CONT’D)
He was the one for me...
The woman gently asks her:
FARM WIFE
And the first boyfriend, you didn’t
think about him any more?
Ella considers this for a moment.
ELLA
He vanished from my mind. No, I
only had eyes for John!

INTERCUT - INT SOUTH CAROLINA SERVICE STATION/INT. WILL’S 27
GARAGE - DAY
Ella dials a public phone inside a service station in South
Carolina.
ELLA
How are you, darling?
Will jumps to his feet; papers and trinkets fly off his
table.
WILL
Mother, where are you?
He’s answered the phone in his garage, which serves as the
warehouse for his webshop. It’s packed with modern antiques:
old road signs, toys, a pinball machine, Bakelite telephones.

Scene 27

Page 45.
WILL (CONT’D)
For God’s sake, tell me where you
are so I can come get you
immediately!
ELLA
Now listen Will. We looked at
family slides last night. It was
beautiful. We were looking at
photos from our trip to Nantucket,
where you made such good friends
with that boy from New York. What
was his name - Patrick?
WILL
You listen to me, Mom. Jane and I
are seriously thinking about filing
a missing persons report.
ELLA
He was so nice. I’ve been wondering
- are you happy with your new work?
You were such a good real estate
broker. You were able to sell some
truly ugly houses...
WILL
Don’t change the subject.
ELLA
Was it because you had a fight with
your partner? You and Richard were
so close... were you two ...?
WILL
You need to come back and resume
your therapy. It’s crucial, mother.
ELLA
Come on, Will, please talk to me
about... oh Christ!

Ella cannot believe what she’s seeing. Now seated behind the
wheel, John starts the motor and the Leisure Seeker begins to
move.
WILL
What did you say? Mom?
But Ella has dropped the receiver without even putting it on
its hook. She rushes outside.

Scene 27

Page 46.

Meanwhile, the camper is leaving the service area. John puts
on the turn signal as Ella shouts and waves...
ELLA
John! John! Stop! STOP!
...but he joins the highway and disappears.
Will is shouting on the telephone:
WILL
Mom! What’s happening? You’re
killing me! MOTHER!!!
The Young Attendant, who has begun to pump gas into a HarleyDavidson, looks at Ella and then looks at the camper pulling
away. Understanding, he begins to laugh.
YOUNG ATTENDANT
(to the Motorcyclist)
Oh shit, it looks like gramps
forgot his wife.
A powerless Ella is in tears. She doesn’t know what to do.
She appeals to the Young Attendant.
ELLA
Help me, please!
The MOTORCYCLIST screws on his fuel cap and kick-starts his
bike.
MOTORCYCLIST
Hop aboard.
ELLA
On that? How?
MOTORCYCLIST
Piece of cake. (to Young Attendant)
Give her a hand, Joe.
The Young Attendant practically lifts Ella in his arms. She
lets him do it, and winds up riding behind the driver.
MOTORCYCLIST (CONT’D)
Hold on tight!
Ella grabs onto the Motorcyclist, who rumbles off.

EXT. MOTORCYCLE, MOVING, SOUTH CAROLINA ROAD. - DAY

A few hundred yards down the road, they come upon the Leisure
Seeker, rolling briskly along. The Motorcyclist steadies the
bike, Ella brandishes her crutch...
Inside, John turns to see through his open window this
strange guy on a Harley with Ella behind him. They draw
closer. John shouts, in an offended tone:
JOHN
Ella, what the hell are you doing
on a motorcycle? It’s dangerous for
God’s sake!

INT. CAMPER, MOVING, SOUTH CAROLINA ROAD. DAY

A furious Ella sits next to John.
JOHN
I don’t believe you. On a
motorcycle! Without a helmet! And
who was that guy?
ELLA
Oh... go to hell!
JOHN
After you, ma’am!
Ella stares out the window in silence, determined not to say
a word. After a bit John puts a hand on her knee and says:
JOHN (CONT’D)
This is a lovely trip, isn’t it?
ELLA
Go to hell, John. I mean it.
JOHN
(surprised)
What?
ELLA
You left without me.
John doesn’t seem to understand.

Scene 29

Page 48.
JOHN
(ridiculous)
I didn’t!
ELLA
You left me alone. Where the hell
did you think you were going, you
and your empty head?
JOHN
Me? Going somewhere? Without you?
Are you crazy?

She snorts, tired of this childish bickering. They are silent
for a while and then John once again puts a hand on her knee.
JOHN (CONT’D)
How you doing, little lady?
She removes his hand, still shaken, sullen and sore. She
rummages through her purse, in search of tablets. She tries
to open a bottle of Pepsi but her hands are too shaky. John
is watching out of the corner of his eye and reaches for the
bottle:
Let me.

JOHN (CONT’D)

She needs to drink it to swallow her pills so reluctantly she
lets him take the bottleELLA
Be careful, John.
John smiles, puts his elbows on the horizontal steering wheel
and steers with them as he unscrews the cap, but this action
causes the Winnebago to swerve gently back and forth, snaking
first left towards the other lane, then right towards the
shoulder, until the bottle is opened and he hands it to her.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Thank you. Now please put both
hands on the wheel.
POV: The Leisure Seeker has been swerving, heading first
towards the opposite lane and then back. There is no oncoming
traffic but a Toyota traveling in the same direction as the
Winnebago is compelled to slow to a crawl and loudly blow its
horn as the Winnebago does its Conga Line down the highway.
The scene is witnessed by a cop, who hits his lights and
starts to chase, passing the Toyota as he turns on:
A SIREN

Scene 29

Inside the camper, Ella bolts down three pills, takes a big
gulp of Pepsi, then looks in the side mirror.
John.
Yup?

ELLA (CONT’D)
JOHN

Scene 29

Page 49.
ELLA
You need to pull over.
JOHN
You need to pee?
ELLA
The police are right behind us.

John looks in the mirror.
So?
Pull over.

JOHN
ELLA

JOHN
Why? They don’t want me...
ELLA
(shouts)
Damn it John, pull over!
Finally John uses the turn signal and pulls over. He puts the
vehicle in PARK and TURNS OFF the engineELLA (CONT’D)
Let me talk, all right? I need to
see if that fool son of ours
snitched on us.
They watch as a POLICEMAN gets out of the car and approaches.
POLICEMAN
License and registration, please.
ELLA
They’re in here somewhere, officer.
She stands up and opens a hatch above their heads to take out
a document case. As she does, we note that there’s a shotgun
inside. She closes the door quickly and hands the documents
to the cop, who examines them.
POLICEMAN
Mr. Spencer. I’ve stopped you
because I saw you weaving between
lanes.
Ella, returning to her seat, seems relieved - Will did not
call.

Scene 29

Page 50.
ELLA
Excuse me, officer, it was my
fault. I gave the bottle to my
husband, I couldn’t open it.

She shows him the Pepsi. John immediately grabs it and takes
a big sip. Ella bites her lip, while the policeman looks at
John with astonishment.
POLICEMAN
Ma’am, if you don’t mind, I’d like
for Mr. Spencer to answer himself.
JOHN
(looking seriously at the
policeman, engaged, eager
to help)
Yes, sir. I was trying to open
the... the thing’n.
The thing?

POLICEMAN

JOHN
That thing.
There follows a short, embarrassing silence. Ella wants to
help him, but the word comes quietly to John’s head as if
it’s always been there.
JOHN (CONT’D)
(as if obviously)
The bottle.
Another long silence, John watches the policeman as he looks
closely at both passengers. And then John turns his head to
Ella and emits:
A LOUD BURP
Ella jolts; she’s right on the edge of losing it. The
policeman, after glaring at John, says:
POLICEMAN
I’m going to run your license. Wait
here.
He walks away.
ELLA
(through clenched teeth)
What are you, insane?
As an answer, John puts his hand on the key and starts the
engine. Ella, in desperation, reaches over, turns it off and
pulls the key out.

Scene 29

Page 50A.
JOHN
Give me back the keys.

Scene 29

Page 51.
ELLA
(whispers)
Don’t even think about it.
JOHN
Give them to me!

Ella, getting even more worried, glances in the rearview
mirror and whispers.
ELLA
Zip it. He’s coming back.
POLICEMAN
What’s going on, old timer? You
thinking of running on me?
He’s smiling, however, and adds:
POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
You wanna wind up on World’s
Slowest Police Chases?
Ella laughs and gently claps her hands:
ELLA
That’s a good one, officer.
POLICEMAN
Stay in your lane and respect the
speed limits, okay?
ELLA
Yes, officer. Thank you so much.
And have a nice day!
The officer walks away.
JOHN
(grumbles)
Slowest Police Chase. Damned fool.
Who’s he think I am? O.J.? Hah!
He takes the keys from Ella, puts the camper in gear and
drives. Ella looks at him affectionately, her anger gone. She
sinks languidly into her seat as the drugs kick in.
ELLA
Our old trips were never this
adventurous, eh?

Scene 29

Page 52.
JOHN
(a bit nonsensically)
Traveling’s important. Broadening
your horizons broadens your mind.

Ella looks at him for a long moment.
ELLA
Do you love me, John?
John shoots her a look.
JOHN
Of course I love you. I love you, I
love you, I love you.
ELLA
Me too, John. Very much.

FULL SCREEN: another slide show’s in progress. The subject is
Will and Jane as teenagers, along with their friends. They
celebrate Will’s thirteenth birthday as he blows out the
candles on the cake.
ELLA
And where are we here?
Ella’s asking John; they sit together as if at the cinema.
JOHN
(squints)
At home? She’s Jane.

*

ELLA
And who’s the one on the right?

JOHN
The littlest one. Our boy.
ELLA
He has a name, John. It’s Will.
Yeah.

JOHN
William.

Lillian is pictured during a summer backyard barbecue. She’s
still attractive, posing next to Ella, both of them in
shorts, their shirts tied up to expose their navels.

Scene 30

ELLA
And the woman with me is...?
JOHN

She lives next door?
ELLA
Right. Our neighbor.
Lillian?
Well done.

JOHN
ELLA

Meanwhile behind them someone makes:
AN APPRECIATIVE WHISTLE
Ella notices a group of grungy young men approaching. They
are dressed in ripped jeans, old T-shirts, unlaced sneakers.
GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
Ma’am, would it bother you if we
watched as well?
ELLA
Please, make yourselves
comfortable!
They squat nearby and pop open some beers, offering bottles
to our couple.
GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
We’re celebrating the end of our
world tour.
The other guys laugh.
ELLA
What are you, some kind of rock
band?
GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
Post-grunge-indie-folk-punk,
actually.
Excuse me?

ELLA

GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
It’s the kind of music we play.
ELLA
That sounds... fascinating.

And now John and Ella are drinking beer while slides play

however, does not appreciate the whistles.

John,

Other images flow by, charting the passage of time in their
yard.
And then there is a more recent series, depicting John’s 74th
birthday. Jane’s there with her two kids and her husband.
Will’s already balding and has a bit of a paunch. There’s
also a large group of students of various ages.
ELLA (CONT’D)
You must remember this. It wasn’t
that long ago.

*

John examines the faces, but doesn’t seem to recognize any of
them, leaving Ella to explain them to the band members.
ELLA (CONT’D)
These are family, friends and
John’s ex-students. There always
seemed to be some around the house.
They still come to see him years
after graduating. John was a very
popular teacher.
And then come several close-ups of John. His unsmiling
expression is distracted, far away. We’ve seen this look.
The young musicians begin to get up and go.
GRUNGY YOUNG MAN
Good night, thanks for the show.
ELLA
Yes, good night, thanks for
visiting.
Ella stares at John, whose eyes remain fixed on the screen.
Although he seems unmoved, tears trickle down his face.

INT. CAMPER/EXT. CAMPSITE, JEKYLL ISLAND - NIGHT

A31

John, smiling in his sleep, cheerfully murmurs something like
“Ella, where are you going … don’t be that way, come here …
hey, wait …” He wakes from his happy dream, deeply
disoriented. We see the inside of the camper through his
milky, fuzzy gaze. Details come into focus: objects on the
bedside table, his shoes, and then someone lying next to him:
a back, an arm, a neck. Finally, the plucked head of Ella.
John shakes her gently. She opens her eyes.
JOHN
Excuse me, where’s Ella?
ELLA
(patiently)
I’m right here, John.
John smiles incredulously and shakes his head.
JOHN
No - Ella. Ella Carson. My girl.
22, long blonde hair. She’s
gorgeous.
Ella, half asleep, slowly understands what’s happening.
Unnerved, she rises with some effort. She pulls her wig on
loosely, drapes a sweater over her shoulders, and stepping
into her shoes as if they were slippers she leaves the camper
without a word.
Left alone, dazed, John tries to focus on his location as the
dream fades. He gets up and leaves the motor-home.
Outside, he spots Ella sitting alone on a park bench in the
moonlight, her back to him.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Is that really you, Ella?
She answers with controlled fury.
ELLA
Of course it’s me.
JOHN
I’m me. John.
ELLA
Oh no, you’re not.

Who are you?

Scene A31

Page 56.

John steps in front of her, with a hesitant smile, as if to
say: look at me, it is me. Ella does not return his smile.
She shakes her head.
ELLA (CONT’D)
My John is a young teacher. He’s
charming and educated and very
handsome. And I want him back.
You stole him from me and I want
him back. Give him back to me!
John considers her words. He sits next to her.
JOHN
Boy, I would if I could. But
whoever stole him from you stole
him from me, too.

INT. CAMPER, JEKYLL ISLAND - SUNRISE

The first light of morning filters through the windows. Ella
opens her eyes and realizes she’s alone.
John?

ELLA

She struggles out of bed. She opens the curtains, then opens
the camper door and peers outside. John isn’t there.
ELLA (CONT’D)
(louder) John?
Something tells her to open the door of the cabinet where she
hides the shotgun. It’s there. Ella looks relieved.
32

INT. RECEPTION DESK, CAMPSITE, JEKYLL ISLAND - DAY
Ella addresses a young man behind the reception desk.
ELLA
Excuse me, but you haven’t by any
chance seen my husband passing by?
He’s tall, distinguished-looking,
with a white beard and glasses.
The guy watches her, thinking.
RECEPTIONIST
A guy like that passed by here
’bout a half hour ago.

32

Scene 32

Page 57.
ELLA
And where was he going?
RECEPTIONIST
No idea ma’am.
ELLA
I’m afraid I’ll need your help,
then. My husband suffers moments of
memory loss, and I’m afraid he may
wander off and get hurt.
RECEPTIONIST
Maybe you should call the cops?
ELLA
But don’t you have a car so we can
have a quick look around? He can’t
have gone far.
RECEPTIONIST
I can’t leave my post. Why not use
your camper?
ELLA
It’s too big, I can’t handle it.
Please, I wouldn’t ask you if it
wasn’t important.
RECEPTIONIST
Lemme call my brother Terry.

He dials a number on his phone.

INT. PICK-UP, MOVING THROUGH STREETS OF JEKYLL ISLAND - DAY33
Ella sits in the cab of a pick-up driven by a tattooed young
man - TERRY. His bleached hair is gathered in a ponytail; he
wears many rings, bracelets and necklaces. They are scouring
the streets of the seaside town.
ELLA

The boy points to an old homeless man who sleeps leaning
against the trunk of a palm tree.
TERRY
(excited)
Hey, is that him?

Page 58.
ELLA
Who, that poor geezer? Oh no,
darling, I’ve told you, my John is
a very distinguished gentleman.
Glasses, well-groomed beard...
TERRY
I get it. Academic from Yankeeland. I like that type.

Ella watches Terry with a knowing smile.
ELLA
I think my son is a lot like you.
Like me?

TERRY

ELLA
You’re gay, right? Don’t worry, I
know it’s not a disease. We should
all be more gay. Happier. It’s a
gift from God.
Terry laughs and nods.
TERRY
You think maybe this God could gift
me blue eyes and make me six inches
taller?
Ella speaks as she continues to scrutinize passersby:
ELLA
Will’s never wanted to accept
himself. Or maybe he’s never
understood himself. It’s such a
shame. Maybe he’d have been
happier, more cheerful if he had.
You want nothing more than to know
your children are happy, especially
after you’re gone...
TERRY
Will’s lucky to have a Mom like
you.
ELLA
Unfortunately, he won’t have a
mother like me for much longer.

Scene 33

Page 59.
TERRY
Don’t say that - you look pretty
fit to me. That wig is awesome.
ELLA
What makes you think I’m wearing a
wig?

Terry gives her a double-take and Ella laughs.
She continues to search, but she is also lost in a memory.
ELLA (CONT’D)
A few months ago I came home and
found a shotgun on the kitchen
table. It gave me such a fright!
John was calmly watching football
on TV. When I asked him what the
gun was doing there, he couldn’t
answer. Later I found a note, but
all that was written on it was
“Ella my love” followed by some
scribbles. And then I understood.
Silence. The boy is intrigued.
TERRY
What is it?
ELLA
(mutters)
For such an intelligent man to feel
his brain fading away...
But suddenly she lights up, her eyes wide, shouting, beside
herself with joy.
ELLA (CONT’D)
There he is! Stop!
She points to a seafront ice cream shop, where John sits at a
table.
The pick-up enters the parking lot, stopping practically a
meter away from John. Terry helps Ella descend.
John!

ELLA (CONT’D)

He turns to look at her, but does not seem to recognize her.
He returns his attention to his cup of chocolate ice cream.
Ella reaches him and embraces him. She starts to cry.

Scene 33

Page 60.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Jesus, John!
JOHN
Why are you crying?
ELLA
Because you weren’t there. I
wouldn’t know how to live without
you, not for a minute. We have to
stick together. Understand? We
don’t have much time left.
JOHN
(serenely)
Then it’s a good thing you came
cause you wouldn’t want to miss
this. One helluva chocolate ice
cream.

Ella turns to Terry, who looks amused and a bit moved by the
scene.
TERRY
Have a seat, ma’am. I’ll go get you
your ice cream.
Ella, crying, changes the order.
ELLA
I’d prefer a whisky.

and Alligators.

Page 61.
ELLA
(she is saying)... it was cold, but
it was beautiful. Remember?
Everything was covered by a layer
of ice, shiny and transparent, like
the world had been covered with
glass. I had to take tiny steps to
keep from slipping. I was so cold,
but you wanted to go on. You were
telling me the story of White Fang,
keeping your voice low, so you
wouldn’t spoil the perfect silence.
We got home at three in the
morning, our hair full of frost.
That was the night we made Jane...

The camper starts to sway. John struggles to keep the
steering wheel steady.
ELLA (CONT’D)
What are you doing? Can’t you keep
it straight?
In the cabin, objects begin to fall, plates and jars shake
and slam. John slows down and pulls over.
JOHN
It’s all right. Just a flat.
CUT TO:
The road is completely deserted. There is no sign of life.
John, sweaty and with dirty hands, crouches in front of a
flat tire. He tries in vain to turn the jack handle.
Ella approaches, wrapping up a phone conversation.
ELLA
(on the phone)
...good, we’ll be waiting for you.
Yes, mile marker 21. Thanks!
She hangs up the phone and turns to John.
ELLA (CONT’D)
It’s okay, hon. Triple A will be
here in half an hour. And I think
the spare is flat, anyway. We’ll
need a tow.
JOHN
I don’t need them.

Oh my god, John. These guys are

JOHN
Can’t you see they’re just a couple
of kids?

You folks need a hand?
John looks at Ella: you see? But Ella quickly says:
ELLA
No thanks, fellas. Triple A will be
here soon.
SECOND KID
How long ‘til they get here?
JOHN
(obliviously)
Half an hour if we’re lucky.
Good.

SECOND KID

He pulls out a knife.

John, you fool.
FIRST KID
Just be cool. We’re going to take
your shit and then we’ll go.
SECOND KID
Gimme that phone!

He points to the cell in Ella’s hand. She hands it to him.
SECOND KID (CONT’D)
Your ring, too.
Now the other guy’s pulled out a knife. He approaches John.
FIRST KID
Where’s your wallet at, old man?
JOHN
Never end a sentence with a
preposition. When you say ‘where’
the ‘at’ is implied...
Wham! He’s silenced with a slap.
ELLA
(terrified)
John, just do what they say.
She slips off her ring and gives it to the Second Kid. And
then she raises her hands, motioning to John to do the same.
SECOND KID
And you, old woman, shut up and
give me your purse.
ELLA
It’s in the camper. Shall I get it?
He gives her permission with a wave. She obeys.
SECOND KID
Just move slowly, all right?
ELLA
As if I have a choice.
She disappears into the camper.
Meanwhile John has raised his hands. The First Kid is trying
to pull the wallet from John’s pocket.
FIRST KID
Fuck, it’s huge. You win the
lottery, old man?
He slices John’s pocket open with the knife. He pulls out the
enormous wallet, gives it a quick disappointed look, then
turns to his companion. His expression changes immediately.

Scene 35

Page 64.
Ah, shit.

FIRST KID (CONT’D)

Ella has come out of the camper holding the shotgun, which
she points at the Second Kid.
The First Kid grabs John and holds the knife to his throat.
FIRST KID (CONT’D)
Put down the fucking gun or I hurt
him bad.
But Ella continues to wield the shotgun confidently, pointing
it first at one, and then at the other.
ELLA
If you hurt him I’ll shoot you
both. And if you think we’re afraid
you’re dead wrong. I - no, we have nothing to lose. So drop the
knives, you hooligans.
At that moment there’s a sound...
THE CHIRPY RING OF ELLA’S
CELLPHONE
...in the hand of the First Kid, who looks at the display.
ELLA (CONT’D)
It’s Will, right?
FIRST KID
(nods)
I ain’t answering it.
ELLA
Well I don’t want to talk to him.
He’s always calling at the wrong
time. Toss it on the ground.
The two kids exchange an uncertain look and we realize that
they’re not professionals. The telephone stops ringing.
JOHN
Sweetheart, make sure the safety’s
off before you start shooting,
okay?
ELLA
Already done it, hon, thanks.
The First Kid drops the knife.

Page 65.
FIRST KID
Let’s go, Cody. Just give them back
their shit.

He throws the wallet on the ground.
ELLA
Please do as he says, Cody. Put the
ring on the wallet and get along. I
won’t even call the cops if you
leave now. Hurry along.
After a moment’s hesitation, he obeys, leaving the ring and
the cellphone. After one last disbelieving look the two of
them move briskly away.
SECOND KID
Your ring sucked anyway.
FIRST KID
And your wallet’s full of bullshit.
As they get into their car, John shouts after them:
JOHN
You fellas should consider evening
classes. Get your diplomas! Turn
things around. S’not too late!
The Plymouth peels away. There’s a moment of silence. Ella
still has the shotgun pointed.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Good thing we had the gun. I was
afraid we’d left it at home.
ELLA
I thought we might need it. Now - I
need a Canadian. Could you get it
from the fridge please?
John obeys. Ella takes the opportunity to remove the shells
from the gun and throw them as far as she can into the
surrounding fields.

On board the camper, John and Ella sit cheerfully. They
celebrate the success of their misadventure by passing a
bottle of Canadian Club. Ella’s on the phone:
ELLA
Yes, darling, I know that your
brother called. I didn’t answer
because I was... held up.
John smiles - he appreciates the pun.
Jane speaks on her cell phone while striding across the
campus of the college where she teaches. She juggles the
phone and her paper-stuffed shoulder bag.
JANE
We’re really worried, mother.
Will’s getting desperate. I’m going
to see him now.
ELLA
Your brother is a Nervous Nelly.
It’s nice of you to stay near him.
Tell him that your father and I are
having a grand old time.
Jane’s a bit amused by her mother’s response.
JANE
So where are you, Mom?
ELLA
Darling, I wish you could see the
sky here.
JANE
Okay, I get it, you aren’t going to
tell me. How’s Dad?
Ella shoots a look at her husband, who’s taking a big sip of
Canadian Club.
ELLA
Full of beans. Oh, he still has his
moments. But he’s doing well and
he’s driving, which is a miracle.
Would you like to speak with him?
Ella passes the phone to her husband.
ELLA (CONT’D)
It’s Jane - she wants to speak with
you.

JOHN
Who is it?
ELLA
Your daughter! Take it.

John takes the phone and cheerfully shouts:
JOHN
Hey, Pumpkin! How are you?
Jane is so moved that she is forced into a moment’s silence.
JANE
I don’t think you’ve called me that
since I was eight, Daddy.
She stops in her tracks. Floored by her father’s words.
JANE (CONT’D)
You’re being careful, right?
JOHN
You’ve been so much in my head
these days, little one. Do you have
any idea how proud I am of you. I
bet you’re making a big splash at
your college. It’s not for nothing
you’re named Spencer.
JANE
Yes, Daddy.
JOHN
I love you, Pumpkin. We’ll see you
soon...
He passes the phone hastily to his wife.

Kiss the kids for me. And tell your

A choked-up Jane can hardly speak.
JANE

She snatches it from his hand.

JANE
Leave them alone. They’re having
fun.
She says this to Will, who shakes his head. They’re sitting
on a zebra-striped sofa in his garage ‘office.’
WILL
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to
introduce Jane the All-Knowing.
Watch her explain everything to
poor Will. Who doesn’t know Jack
Shit.
JANE
(smiles, sighs)
What the hell are you talking
about? I’m just telling you that
there’s nothing we can do to stop
them. It’s her right to refuse
treatment. We both know how little
good it is now, anyway.
WILL
I know that it’s better than
wandering around god-knows-where in
a creaky camper. But you know best,
I guess, because you talked to Dad,
and you two are thick-as-thieves,
even when he doesn’t even remember
who we are.

Scene 37

Page 69.
JANE
I don’t understand why you’re
making this so personal, Will...
WILL
Because you live two hours away and
phone once a week and come on
weekends for lunches that are
cooked by me. What do you know
about spending long afternoons with
Dad when he doesn’t say a single
thing that makes sense? Do you
know what Mom says when she gets
sick and I have to run there in the
middle of the night? You know what
she says when I get there? Don’t
call Jane. She’s busy.
JANE
You’ve been telling this story
about how I’m Daddy’s Girl for
years. It’s bullshit, Will.
WILL
Maybe it is. But it’s the only
story I’ve got.
JANE
They’re just doing what they’ve
done their whole life. Staying
together, the two of them.

Jane wants to hug him, but Will backs away in a sulk.
WILL
There’s so much love between them
that they forgot about us. Both of
us.
Oh Will..

JANE

Jane sighs at the sight of her brother’s fragility.
WILL
So you know what happened, when was
it, last year? I opened their
bedroom door and she was on the bed
and he was kneeling in front of her
and... I can’t even say it.
JANE
(smiling)
Dad was muff diving?
the canyon?

Yodelling in

Scene 37

Page 70.
WILL
(shivers)
I wanted to vomit.
JANE
(laughing)
Why? I hope it happens to me when
I’m their age.

Will buries his head in his hands.
WILL
God, what a thought.
Jane is struck by a melancholy thought about her life.
JANE
Though I kinda doubt it. For years
now, with Philip and me, it’s one
quick kiss and goodnight.

INT. CAMPER, MOVING/ EXT. POLITICAL RALLY, FLORIDA - DAY

38

The flat tire has been repaired and the Leisure Seeker is
back on the road. Ella continues to write on the pad of paper
resting on her knees. But she raises her eyes because the
camper suddenly slows down: the road is filled with
participants in a Republican election rally.
JOHN
Houston, we have a problem.
ELLA
Just pull over. We can wait.
Hemingway isn’t going anywhere.
There are red hats that read ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN;’ tshirts and banners with the grinning face of the Republican
candidate.
PEOPLE ARE YELLING SLOGANS
John is forced to pull over.
JOHN
Wanta go see.
ELLA
What’s to see? You know who these
people are.

Scene 38

Page 71.
JOHN
I want to have a look -

John is out of the vehicle in an instant, and Ella’s too
tired to chase after him. All she can do is yell:
ELLA
Don’t go far!
John turns and gives her an OK sign, smiling. And then he
asks someone what’s going on.
CUT TO:
A little later, John wears a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat,
drinks beer and toasts rabid supporters as they shout slogans
like:
REPUBLICAN SUPPORTERS
- The only good terrorist is a dead
terrorist.
- This land is our land!
- No more Muslims! Ban them all!
- Build a wall too tall for
Mexicans!
Each of these slogans is greeted by a joyous ‘Yes!,’ which
John echoes with real conviction, as if it were a funny game
he didn’t understand. This carries on until a hand grabs his
arm to pull him away:
ELLA
John, please, come with me.
JOHN
But this is so much fun!
ELLA
Yes, I know, but it’s better that
you come with me now. We’re gonna
get a parking ticket.
As she begins to drag him away, John shouts:
JOHN
See you later, everybody! Make
America great again!
Those gathered nearby raise their beer bottles to toast John.
CUT TO:

Scene 38

Page 72.

John and Ella are once again in the camper. They are leaving;
the road is once again passable.
ELLA
John, they were Republicans.
JOHN
(nodding agreement)
Uh-huh...
ELLA
You’ve voted Democrat your whole
life. You volunteered for Walter
Mondale. Don’t you remember how mad
you got when I talked about voting
for Reagan?
JOHN
Ray-gun... ha, that’s funny ELLA
Don’t you remember him?
JOHN
(thinks, then nods)
Sure, I remember.
ELLA
That’s not true. You don’t have the
slightest idea. Who am I?
John’s mouth falls open. He smiles and looks at her but her
name is not coming to him.

Scene 38

Page 73.
ELLA (CONT’D)
(patiently)
Think, John. You know my name very
well. It starts with -

There is a pause and then John looking at her suggests L?

JOHN

ELLA
Right. Ell. Go on.
It’s on the tip of John’s tongue.
Lillian!

JOHN

ELLA
Sweet Jesus, now you think I’m
Lillian? Lillian is our next door
neighbor. I’m your wife. L? LA?

*

JOHN
Ella. My darling Ella. Excuse me.
Oh, wow, my poor head.

Ella continues to stare at him, trying to understand what’s
going on inside his head.

EXT. CAMPSITE, NEAR DAYTONA - NIGHT

39

The projector's carousel turns. All the slides are of Jane
and Will: swimming in the ocean, stuffing cake into their
mouths at a birthday party, Trick-or-Treating, rolling in
piles of raked leaves, posing rigidly by the fireplace,
sitting on Santa’s lap at a shopping center, close-up
portraits...
Ella and John are once again seated outside the Leisure
Seeker like they’re at a cinema. There are no other campers
around, only the deep coniferous woods that surround the
camp. John eats a sandwich, while Ella swallows a blue
painkiller. There’s no commentary from her this time, no
narration. She’s not in a good way. And then John opens his
mouth:
JOHN
Look how cute Jane was!
Ella smiles and nods yes, happy that John is enthusiastic.
Next comes a photo of Will sitting on the shoulders of a
tall, handsome man with an intelligent expression.

Scene 39

Page 74.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Hey, look - that’s Jim!

But then his expression darkens. He asks Ella:
JOHN (CONT’D)
How’s Jim these days?
ELLA
Jim passed, hon. Last July. We went
to see him at that human warehouse
where he spent his last two years,
remember? (she sighs)
Unfortunately, he didn’t recognize
us.
John thinks, trying to remember. He murmurs:
JOHN
That’s terrible. Poor Jim.
Ella watches him, trying to read his thoughts. And then John
looks at her.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Promise me something.
What?

ELLA

JOHN
If you love me, when the time
comes, put the shotgun in my hands,
put my finger on the trigger,
remind me what I want to do, kiss
me and walk away. It’s like mud
season in Massachusetts. Messy but
necessary.
Ella reaches out and firmly grips her husband's hand.
She presses the button to continue the show, but the carousel
is at its end. White light almost blinds them. John
instinctively pulls out the power cord to kill the painful
light, leaving them in near-darkness.
ELLA
John, what have you done? Put it
back in.
JOHN
I can’t find the outlet.

Scene 39

Page 75.

And then they hear what sounds like an animal in the bushes.
ELLA
What’s that?
JOHN
Unlikely it’s an alligator.
be on us by now.

He’d

ELLA
Oh my god - an alligator?
JOHN
Let’s get the gun.
Ella rises.
ELLA
Let’s go inside.
Muttering to herself.
ELLA (CONT’D)
We don’t have any shells...
She heads toward the camper, but she trips and takes a dive.
Ella?

JOHN

ELLA
Help me, John. I think I’ve pulled
something in my back. I’m down here
on the ground. Help me get up.
Oh shit!

JOHN

John approaches Ella and extends his hand.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Give me your hand.
ELLA
John, I can’t do it like that.
JOHN
Give me your hand.
Ella grabs John’s hand. He tries to pull her up, but he loses
his balance and falls on top of her. They remain like this,
on the ground, a situation comic and dire at the same time.

Scene 39

Page 76.
ELLA
Get up! You’re crushing me.
JOHN
I hurt my arm.
ELLA
So what? Get off!

John gathers all his strength and manages to roll off her.
Now they are side-by-side on the ground, with no strength
left. They look at one another.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Are you all right?
JOHN
What’re we doing on the ground?
ELLA
I fell! Don’t you even remember?
You tried to help me and you fell,
too.
Oh, shit.

JOHN

ELLA
We need to try to reach the camper.
Can you move?
JOHN
Nope. Can’t do it.
Ella does not lose heart. She begins to crawl toward the
vehicle. The stones hurt; she’s soon covered in mud and dirt.
But gradually she approaches the steps. She grabs on and
tries to pull herself up, but fails.
ELLA
I can’t do it. Get up and get over
here and help me.
John does not respond.
John?

ELLA (CONT’D)

Nothing. And so she makes another effort. She plants an elbow
on the ground and clings to the steps with her free hand so
she can turn around and rest her back against the steps. Now
at least she’s sitting up. She looks at John. She can’t
believe it - he’s asleep, right there on the ground.

Scene 39

Page 77.

Snoring, as if tucked snugly in his bed. She begins to pick
up pebbles and toss them at him until the snoring stops. John
stirs and then, after a direct hit, angrily says:
JOHN
Are you crazy? What are you trying
to do, stone me to death?
ELLA
I hurt my back. You need to get
over here and help me up. I can’t
do it on my own.
He pulls himself up - it seems as if that quick nap has
helped him recover. But instead of going over to help Ella,
he approaches the projector.
JOHN
Hey, the projector’s unplugged...
Ella screams at him at the top of her lungs.
ELLA
JOHN! Move your ass and help me!
Finally, John gets up and goes to her. She holds out her arms
when he leans over, but he doesn’t even see her. Instead, he
lowers himself even further, toward her shoes.
ELLA (CONT’D)
What on earth are you doing?
JOHN
Your shoes are untied.
He begins to tie her shoes with care.
ELLA
Thank you, John.
JOHN
With everything you do for me?
This is nothing He gets up and kisses her on the mouth. And then he begins to
gently wipe the dirt off her face.
JOHN (CONT’D)
You’re all dirty.
He gives her a gentle pat.

Scene 39

Page 78.
JOHN (CONT’D)
What would I be without you? You
want to know? Nothing.
ELLA
Don’t exaggerate. Sure, lately
you’ve needed my help, but...

John smiles sweetly, shaking his head no.
JOHN
It’s been this way our whole lives.
Without you I couldn’t have done
anything, my darling, darling
little one. My goodness, look how
sexy you are Ella has to swallow back the lump rising in her throat. John
has always been affectionate, but only in his brusque, dry
manner. He’s never used an endearment like that with her. In
order not to be overwhelmed by emotion, she waves her arms,
as if it’s a big joke.
ELLA
How about a little pick-me-up?
JOHN
That sounds like an excellent idea.
This time he grabs her beneath her arms and, just like that,
they’re both on their feet again. He helps her slowly climb
the ladder.
40

INT. CAMPER, DAYTONA - SUNRISE

40

Ella is sleeping, but a noise inside the van disturbs her and
she opens her eyes. John isn’t beside her. She looks at the
time on the electronic alarm clock, then lifts the curtain.
Outside, the chairs and table are missing.
ELLA
John? What’s the big rush to go?
She pulls herself up with great difficulty.
ELLA (CONT’D)
I could’ve used a little more
sleep. John? Oh my God.
Her eyes widen. She’s confronted with an unlikely sight: John
is pointing the shotgun at her. He’s already dressed and has
a deeply serious expression.

Scene 40

Page 79.
JOHN
It’s the moment of truth, Ella...
ELLA
For heaven’s sake, what is this?
JOHN
Take me to him. Now.
To who?

ELLA

JOHN
To whom. To Dan. Dan Coleman. I
need to look him straight in the
eye.
Ella’s not worried about the gun - she knows it’s empty.
ELLA
John, for God’s sake.
JOHN
I’m not going to wait for some
snowy night for you to finally
confess everything as you look out
the window at the snow falling
faintly through the universe Ella pulls herself up impatiently.
ELLA
I’m getting so sick of this
nonsense.
JOHN
He was always there for you. Dan! I
was only ever second-best.
John’s words come as a revelation that makes Ella shudder:
she feels compassion for him, but also anger.
ELLA
How dare you point a gun at me!
JOHN
Take me to him.

Scene 40

Page 80.

Ella leaps to her feet.
ELLA
I’ve had enough! I’m sorry you’ve
been thinking this all these years
but ... you want to see Dan
Coleman? Fine!
She grabs her cell phone from her bag.
JOHN
What are you doing?
ELLA
I’m going to find out where the
hell Dan is - even if he’s in his
grave - and take you to him.
You will?

JOHN
Finally!

She dials a number and then looks at him as she puts the
phone to her ear.
ELLA
Well, don’t just stand there.
Start the damned engine.
JOHN
Oh, I will!
41

EXT. RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA - DAY

41

The camper arrives at the entrance of a residential care
center for the elderly.
ELLA
(speaking with John)
You can’t go in there with a gun!
JOHN
I’m going in as I see fit.
ELLA
Fine. Take it. A hundred cops will
show up and probably kill us both.
42

INT. RECEPTION AND CORRIDOR, RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA

An African-American Receptionist raises her eyes from a
computer screen.

Scene 42

Page 80A.
CENTER RECEPTIONIST
May I help you?

Scene 42

Page 81.
ELLA
We’d like to see Daniel Coleman,
please. I believe he’s a resident
here?

Ella forces a reassuring smile. John frowns, and there’s a
strange bulge in the left side of his jacket.
CENTER RECEPTIONIST
Daniel Coleman?
Exactly.

ELLA

CENTER RECEPTIONIST
Are you on the list?
ELLA
We’re old friends. We were just
passing by.
CENTER RECEPTIONIST
One moment, please.
ELLA
You’re very kind.
The receptionist rises from her post and enters an office.
Ella’s forced smile becomes a worried grimace when she
realizes that John has begun to walk down the corridor on his
own, his pace lopsided due to what’s hidden in his jacket.
She walks behind him.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Hey, she said to wait.
John doesn’t answer. He opens the first of a long series of
doors along the corridor and looks inside: there’s an
emaciated old man seated at a table, peeling an apple.
JOHN
Is that you, Coleman?
The old man gives him a strange look. Ella reaches John.
ELLA
I’m sorry, we seem to have the
wrong room.
OLD MAN
Who you looking for?

Scene 42

Page 82.
ELLA
We don’t want to disturb you...

But John will not be denied.
JOHN
Daniel Coleman. You know him? Which
room is his?
43

INT. DAN’S ROOM, RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA - DAY.

43

Another room, where Old Man 2, glasses perched on his ruddy
nose, lies in bed listening to:
A HAPPY SONG ON THE RADIO
(MAGIC MOMENTS)
... and another man, seen from behind, seated in a
wheelchair, seems mesmerized by something outside the window.
The door opens and John peers inside, followed by Ella.
JOHN
Finally, we find you!
Both old men turn. We can now see the face of the one seated
in the wheelchair: he’s a skinny black guy in his eighties
with oxygen tubes stuck in his nostrils. John points the
shotgun toward the man on the bed, who raises his hands.
Ella tries to hold John back, but it’s too late:
JOHN (CONT’D)
I’ve always wanted to see your
face, Dan Coleman.
Old Man 2 responds, his hands in the air.
OLD MAN 2
But I’m not Dan.
The black man has his hands raised as well. John, getting
disoriented, looks at him.
DAN
Who the hell are you people?
ELLA
It’s Ella. Ella Carson. Do you
remember me?

Scene 43

Page 83.
DAN
Ella? Who the hell is Ella? What do
you want from me? (shouts) Nurse!
Help!

Ella shushes him. John’s not understanding any of this.
JOHN
Where’s Daniel Coleman?
DAN
That’s me. But who the hell are
you?
Meanwhile, Old Man 2 looks terrified, his hands still raised.
John looks at Ella in confusion:
JOHN
That’s him?
But Ella is now gripped by another thought. She continues to
speak to Dan.
ELLA
Do you really not remember me? This
is my husband John Spencer.
John continues to point his gun at Dan as he incongruously
says:
JOHN
Nice to meet you.
Dan stares at him, convinced he’s dealing with two lunatics.
As if to confirm this:
JOHN (CONT’D)
Do you wear boxers?
What?

DAN

JOHN
Do you wear boxers or briefs?
ELLA
This is what you want to know?
DAN
What the hell is he saying?

Scene 43

Page 84.
JOHN
(to Ella)
I want to understand where this
fixation with boxers comes from.
ELLA
All right, then - ask away.
JOHN
Do you wear boxers or briefs?

Dan lowers his hands. This is crazy. Meanwhile, on the radio:
PERRY COMO CONTINUES TO SING
‘MAGIC MOMENTS’
DAN
I wear diapers. (to Ella) Ella who?
I don’t remember any Ella.
ELLA
You don’t remember me? Shoot this
son of a bitch, John.
The door opens. The very worried Center Receptionist and a
Nurse peer inside.
ELLA (CONT’D)
(whispers)
John, put that thing away.
The Receptionist and the Nurse throw open the door.
NURSE
What’s going on here?
JOHN
He doesn’t remember my wife.
Ella grabs the gun from John and tells the two newcomers:
ELLA
Don’t worry, it’s empty.
It is?

JOHN

But the women grab John and lock the door.
ELLA
Wait, he’s not dangerous - he’s an
English teacher!

Scene 43

Page 85.

The nurse brusquely grabs the gun from Ella’s hand.
DAN
(to Ella)
But who the hell are you? Ella who?
44

EXT. RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, DAYTONA - DAY

Ella and John are led to the camper by the Receptionist, the
Nurse, a male MEMBER OF STAFF and a man with the uniform of
security guard, who returns the gun to John.
NURSE
Next time you come to visit your
friend, do it without this, even if
it is empty.
CENTER RECEPTIONIST
Just be grateful we didn’t call the
police.
ELLA
You’ve been very understanding.
MEMBER OF STAFF
We were thinking that perhaps the
two of you might need a little
rest. No offense intended.
He shows Ella a brochure describing the facility’s amenities.
MEMBER OF STAFF (CONT’D)
This contains a list of all the
insurance we accept. We’ll call
your children so they can come tour
the facility...
ELLA
That’s very nice of you. We’ll
think about it.
MEMBER OF STAFF
But are you sure you want to be
travelling around on your own?
It’s nice here. Ask Dan.
The Receptionist is getting embarrassed at her colleague’s
insistence.
RECEPTIONIST
Come on, Brian...

Scene 44

John, meanwhile, has helped Ella climb the steps. He then
gets behind the wheel.
The Leisure Seeker lurches away as the others watch with
amazed, amused and worried expressions.
45

EXT. CAMPER, MOVING, FLORIDA - DAY

While driving the camper, John strokes Ella’s hand.
JOHN
Why are you so sad?
ELLA
I’m just a little tired.
She masks a grimace, then throws down another painkiller.
ELLA (CONT’D)
But yes, I’m also angry. At you,
mostly, but also at Dan.
JOHN
Dan? Dan who?
ELLA
Oh, for Christ’s sake!
JOHN
Oh right. The guy who isn’t in
Savannah any more.
After a long silence.
JOHN (CONT’D)
He was black?
Ella looks at him, then starts to laugh. John laughs, too,
perhaps without even knowing why.
ELLA
He was a little more charismatic
than this at the time.
The camper now passes by a Democratic rally. We might even
glimpse Hillary speaking; an echo of her speech reaches them.
AMPLIFIED VOICE OF HILLARY
But the Spencers aren’t interested. Ella has stopped
laughing; her expression is darkened by suffering. She’s
really tired and hurting.

John?
What?

ELLA (CONT’D)
JOHN

ELLA
Let’s sleep in a real bed tonight.

INT. RADISSON HOTEL, CAPE CANAVERAL - NIGHT

46

In the reception area of a high-end Radisson, Ella approaches
the reception desk while John looks around with cheerful
curiosity. The HOTEL RECEPTIONIST welcomes them with a
ceremonious tone.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
Good evening, ma’am. How might I
assist you?
ELLA
Good evening. Could we have a nice
room that’s... (hesitates)
economical?
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
I’m afraid there’s not much left.
(checks his computer) Half the
state seems to be here to watch
Hillary. We do have a standard
double with twin beds.
ELLA
Oh, no, we can’t be separated.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
In that case we have the deluxe
suite, which has two kings, but
that’s...
ELLA
We’ll take it.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
... that’s normally five hundred
dollars a night ... but I can let
you have it for three-twenty, plus
tax.

Scene 46

Page 88.
ELLA
Heavens, we don’t want to buy it,
just spend the night.

The Receptionist hesitates before bursting into laughter. She
hands him the credit card.
ELLA (CONT’D)
We’ve never spent that much on a
hotel room in my whole life.
The Receptionist pretends not to have heard her as he hands
her the room key card.
HOTEL RECEPTIONIST
You’re in 723. Artie will show you.
Do you have luggage?
47

INT. RADISSON HOTEL, SUITE - NIGHT

The room’s lights come on. ARTIE carries the bag Ella has
packed for the night, while the two guests take in their
luxury room. It is new and huge, decorated in beige and gold
tones. There’s a lounge beyond the bedroom.
ARTIE
I hope this will be to your liking.
There’s a minibar. You also have a
DVD player and a stereo. And in
here’s the master bedroom...
Artie puts their bag into the master bedroom.
JOHN
It’s a beautiful room. Can we
afford it?
ELLA
(embarrassed)
What are you saying, John? Of
course we can afford it.
She rummages through her purse to get a tip, but Artie waves
her off.
ARTIE
Enjoy your stay.
He leaves. Ella immediately turns on the stereo, looking for
a song she likes, and finds:
‘DON’T LEAVE ME THIS WAY’ BY
THELMA HOUSTON

Scene 47

Page 89.
ELLA
And now a little something to help
us sleep.

Ella opens the minibar and finds a bottle of champagne. She
removes it.
ELLA (CONT’D)
What do you say, John? I think
we’ve earned it.
She gives the bottle to John, who whistles when he sees it.
Ella gets two glasses. John opens the bottle, pours
champagne. They toast, while:
‘DON’T LEAVE ME THIS WAY”
CONTINUES
And then they kiss. John makes her do a pirouette; Ella,
laughing, tries to escape. But John insists. She does a
pirouette, then another.
JOHN
Come on, darling, boogie with me.
And then she collapses in his arms, leans forward and vomits.
Ella...

JOHN (CONT’D)

ELLA
Oh my God, I’ve ruined the carpet.
In shock, she starts to clean it with her blouse, but John
lifts her up and gently wipes her mouth with his
handkerchief. And all the while:
“DON’T LEAVE ME THIS WAY”
CONTINUES

The following morning Ella wakes to the voice of John
mumbling from afar. She checks the clock: it’s late.
Hon?

ELLA

Scene 48

Page 90.

She gets up and finds John in the luxurious bathroom, where,
already washed and dressed, he’s combing his hair in front of
the mirror as he describes Santiago of The Old Man and the
Sea.
JOHN
‘The old man was thin and gaunt and
had deep wrinkles in his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent
skin cancer the sun brings from its
reflection on the tropic sea were
on his cheeks. The blotches ran
well down the sides of his face and
his hands had the deep-creased
scars from handling heavy fish on
the cords. But none of these scars
were fresh. They were as old as
erosions in a fishless desert.’
Ella stands there, watching. When he realizes she’s there:
JOHN (CONT’D)
Good morning, honey, you sleep
well?
ELLA
Like a rock. When’s the last time I
slept this late?
JOHN
Okay, I’m off, I’ll be back at the
usual time...
ELLA
Where are you going?
He kisses her, exits the room and heads down the corridor.
Ella follows him in confusion. She stops at the door,
watching as he waves goodbye. But after a few steps he
freezes, lost. He turns to her:
JOHN
But this isn’t our house.
No.

ELLA

JOHN
Where are we?
ELLA
In a good place.

JOHN
This good place have tea?

Ella walks back to the table with a tray of croissants. She
finds John has buttonholed a YOUNG WAITRESS, who listens with
a polite smile.
JOHN
Santiago is the perfect character.
He achieved the inner spiritual
success that defines Hemingway’s
‘true man’. To be defeated but not
destroyed. When we get to the end
of the story Hemingway’s watching
the old man lying there, sound
asleep, the skeleton of his great
fish still on his line, and he
writes...

EXT. CAMPER, MOVING, PALM BEACH - DAY

The Leisure Seeker travels down a coastal road lined with
palm trees. Palm Beach’s skyline serves as backdrop.
Ella’s sick; she cannot stop herself from grimacing. John
notices what’s happening. He pulls to the side of the road.
ELLA
Don’t stop, John. Let’s find a
campsite.

INT. CAMPER, AT CAMPSITE NEAR PALM BEACH - NIGHT

Later, after setting them up, John helps Ella into bed in the
camper. He takes off her shoes.
ELLA
I’m sorry, but I really do need to
lie down. If you’re hungry, there’s
some cheese in the fridge.
John does not answer - he’s too focused on being attentive.
Finally, Ella’s lying comfortably. John asks, tenderly:
JOHN
You better now, Lillian?

Scene 51

Page 93.

Ella looks at him, struck by the fact that John called her
that name once again.
JOHN (CONT’D)
I won’t go home quite yet. Don’t
fret, I won’t leave you alone until
you’re okay.
A inspired thought crosses Ella’s mind. She decides to be
Lillian:
ELLA
Where’s Ella now?
Ella?

JOHN
Ella’s at home.

At home?

ELLA

JOHN
Uh-huh. Baby’s taking its toll. I
should be there. Good God. I’m not
right. I better go to her.
Ella’s trying hard to stay calm. She swallows back her pride
and continues.
ELLA
Wait. Does Ella know about us?
JOHN
You know she doesn’t. I mean, I
couldn’t bear it if Ella knew.
Neither could you. It’d break her
heart. Mine, too. I’m so selfishThe question has stirred John up.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Ella must never know! Never. We
have to stop this, Lillian.
Ella experiences a pang to the heart and can barely hold back
her tears. But she needs to know everything.
ELLA
Yes, we must stop. It’s gone on a
long time.
JOHN
Too long, I guess, yes...

Scene 51

Page 94.
ELLA
How long is too long?

John sighs as he thinks back.
JOHN
We said it’d be only the once and
it’s been nearly two years nowELLA
But do you love me?
John shakes his head and looks at her sadly.
JOHN
Lillian, we’ve talked about this
and you agreed. We’re wonderful
friends. The best, but I love Ella.
We’re expecting another baby.
Ella collapses back on the pillow. She’s desperate now.
JOHN (CONT’D)
Ella’s the love of my life, she’s
everything to me. We’ve another
baby on the way, for god’s sakes.
Ella knows that she’s hearing a great declaration of love,
but she’s too angry to care. John extends his arms. Deeply
moved, he says:
JOHN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry, but goodbye, dear
Lillian goodbye He leaves the camper with a bowed head. Ella rises cursing
from the bed.
ELLA
Son of a bitch! Where are you
going? Get back here! Come here so
I can kill you!
As she screams she grabs objects, dishes, anything at hand,
throwing it all on the ground.
John, hearing the commotion, rushes back in.
JOHN
Ella, what’s happening?
ELLA
Oh, so now I’m Ella again? Damn
you!

Scene 51

Page 95.

She begins to strike him with all her remaining strength.
JOHN
(protecting himself)
What are you doing? Why are you so
mad? What’s happened?
Ella dials a number, calling someone at reception.
ELLA
Good evening, I’m calling from
space 37. Could you please send a
taxi here a.s.a.p? Thank you.
She hangs up in a fury. John watches her blankly as she
begins to pack a bag, filling it with his clothes.
JOHN
(disoriented)
Ella, what are you doing?
ELLA
Quiet, fool. Our trip ends here.
As usual, when she turns on her phone, someone calls. Ella
grabs it and shouts:
ELLA (CONT’D)
Will - what the hell do you want?
Just leave me alone!
And then she turns off her phone.

EXT. CAMPSITE NEAR PALM BEACH - NIGHT

A taxi approaches the Leisure Seeker. A confused John stands
in front of it.
CABBIE
You called a cab?
Ella answers as she descends the motor home’s steps dragging
a bag.
ELLA
Do you see any other customers
waiting around?
She shows the bag to John.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Here’re all your things. Night,
shirt, socks, your damned briefs...

JOHN
What’s happening, Ella?

Ella doesn’t respond. She turns to the taxi driver.

Page 96.
ELLA
Please help me load my husband and
his stupid bag.

The intimidated Cabbie gets out and obeys. He carefully puts
the bag in the trunk. Ella, brusque and furious, opens the
back door of the taxi.
ELLA (CONT’D)
(to John)
Get in, imbecile.
JOHN
Why are you so mad, Ella?
ELLA
Mad? Me? I’m not mad at all. On the
contrary - I’m relieved. Happy as a
clam!
She tells the Cabbie, who is back behind the wheel:
ELLA (CONT’D)
Take us to an old folks’ home. The
crummiest you can find.

INT. RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTER, PALM BEACH - NIGHT.

Ella puts the bag and John’s wallet on the reception counter
in front of a puzzled Clerk. John looks around, baffled.
JOHN
This isn’t where we live.
ELLA
No it isn’t. We’re at a place where
they keep old fools like you. (to
the Clerk) Put him a room, please.
JOHN
Ella, why are you so irritable?
The Clerk, very calmly, as if she’s speaking to a baby,
addresses Ella.
CLERK
Ma’am, we cannot accept new
patients without following
established guidelines.

Scene 53

Page 97.
ELLA
Establish them, then.
CLERK
You can come tomorrow morning at
9:30 to the intake office. If the
gentleman falls within the required
parameters he will be put on a
waiting list. At present, this runs
about ten months.

Ella removes documents and credit cards from John’s wallet,
acting as if the Clerk has not even been speaking.
ELLA
That sounds more like your problem
than mine. Here’s everything you’ll
need. Money, credit cards,
documents. And this photo...
She puts down a photo from an insurance company advertisement
that depicts three smiling generations of a family.
ELLA (CONT’D)
He cut it out of a magazine. He
thinks this is us, that this is his
family! He carries it around in his
wallet! Do you understand now who
you’re dealing with? All right, I’m
tired and you have things to do.
He’s all yours. Good night.
Ella turns her back before the Clerk has time to respond:
ELLA (CONT’D)
Goodbye, John.
And she moves off quickly, heading toward the waiting taxi.
CLERK
(to John)
She must realize that you cannot
stay here.
JOHN
At times she seems like a wounded
buffalo, I know. Are you familiar
with ‘The Short Happy Life of
Francis Macomber?’ (muttered) His
wife got him in the back of the
neck with a 6.5 Mannlicher. Women
with guns ...

Scene 53

What do we do? Call the police?

She’s addressing the HEAD NURSE, who is looking over the
documents left on the counter.
HEAD NURSE
I doubt they’d take him.

INTERCUT - INT. CAMPER/ INT. ELLA’S AND JOHN’S HOUSE - NIGHT.
54
Ella sits on the double bed in the open dining area. The
slide projector’s on her knees. She’s obsessively viewing
slides projected small and crooked on the camper’s wall,
plucking them angrily from containers. She’s looking for
Lillian, tossing any that don’t picture her in a messy pile.
ELLA
There you are, bitch.
She speaks directly to Lillian, pictured smiling sweetly in a
70s miniskirt.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Look at you, with your thighs on
display. Coming into my house all
slutty.
She chooses another photo, this one of a barbecue in the
garden. Lillian has downcast eyes and a downcast expression.
John’s back is to her as he grills hamburgers. Ella comes
closer to better see Lillian’s face.
ELLA (CONT’D)
But look at this face. Are you
suffering, bitch? What about me,
the woman who so happily takes your
photograph?
Ella scours the picture, looking at the back of John’s pants.
She addresses him:
ELLA (CONT’D)
I bought you those pants. And you
took them off for Lillian, you pig.
Angry tears come to her eyes. She takes a sip from the bottle
of Canadian Club at her side, then changes the photo. There’s
no Lillian - she throws it on the pile. She finds one that
depicts Jane at the age of four, watching Lillian from below
with a serious look.

Scene 54

Page 99.
ELLA (CONT’D)
(indignant)
Jane! You knew! And you never said
a word!

She fumbles through her bag, removes her phone and pounds out
a number.
In the guest bedroom, Jane wakes up with a start. Her husband
PHILIP gives her a worried look:
PHILIP
Is it them?
JANE
Yes, it’s Mom! Hello?
In the camper, Ella speaks to her daughter with a voice that
alternates between outrage and near-tears.
ELLA
Your father fooled me all our life
and you knew it.
JANE
Mom, what’s happening? Where are
you?
ELLA
You never said a word. Always on
his side! Professor my ass.
In her bedroom, Jane gives her husband a terrified look.
JANE
Mother, you’re raving! I’m at your
house with Philip and Will - we’re
all here, waiting for you. Where
are you? Let us come get you.
In the camper, Ella is a whirlwind of recriminations,
unstoppable, maybe even drunk.
ELLA
I’m alone. I got rid of your father
and I’m coming back home. Or maybe,
I’m going to the seaside. I don’t
ever want to see him again.
JANE
(distressed)
Mom - where’s Dad?

Scene 54

Page 100.
ELLA
I’m finally free of that horrible
creature who ruined my life. I
don’t give a damn about Hemingway
or Melville or those little
pedantic lessons that always made
me feel like an idiot!

Jane tries to interject.
Mom...

JANE

ELLA
The liar! What do you read in all
those books? Just lies!
Mom!

JANE

ELLA
He lied his whole life! And I bet
he’s pretending to be senile, too.
He’s just an impostor!
JANE
(raises her voice)
Mom! Calm down and answer me!
Where’s Dad? You didn’t leave him
on his own, did you?
ELLA
Never thought you’d have a
vindictive mother, did you? You see
what I’ve become? It’s all his
fault. And yours! Who do you think
you are, you two? Go to hell!
Before Jane can interrupt again, Ella hangs up. She clutches
her head in her hands. She sobs. In a burst of anger, she
rips off the wig, exposing her little bird-like head. Her
daughter tries to call her back:
THE TELEPHONE RINGS
But Ella turns it off and slams it on the bed. She throws
herself down, then pulls herself up, almost out of breath.
She takes another sip of Canadian Club, swallows two blue
pills, throws herself back down. She turns out the light. But
she’s still wide-eyed.

JOHN’S HOUSE - NIGHT.

John sits in a chair in the waiting room. They’ve placed him
in front of a television to keep him happy while the Clerk
and Head Nurse discuss this absurd situation.
CLERK
Maybe we should look for his
children online? We could explain
the situation to them.
HEAD NURSE
I hope they aren’t like his wife.
Crazy woman.
They stop, because a taxi has pulled up in front of the
entrance, carrying Ella. She gets out with her cell-phone
pressed to her ear.
ELLA
You’re right, Jane darling. I’m
sorry. I’m sorry!
She keeps the phone to her ear as she enters the lobby.
ELLA (CONT’D)
I just don’t know what came over
me. Maybe it was my meds.
Everything’s fine, darling. Daddy’s
okay. No, I was only joking. I’d
never abandon him. Now, can you do
me a favor?
Now Jane is in her parents’ living room with Will and Philip,
all of them in pajamas.

Scene 55

Page 102.
JANE
(hesitant)
A favor?

Ella’s in the waiting room. She steps up behind John. She
looks at him, though he’s unaware of her presence.
ELLA
Go to Lillian and tell her
something.
JANE
Mom, Lillian’s...
ELLA
Tell her she’s the dirtiest whore
on earth.
JANE
(dumbfounded)
What did you say?
Jane, now in their parents’ kitchen, raises her eyes to
Lillian, who is also there, next to Will. Lillian wears a
sweater over her nightgown. After the first phone call
earlier that night they’ve organized a crisis team.
While Jane’s been left speechless, Ella, in the waiting room,
adds:
ELLA
No, in the universe. The biggest
whore in the whole universe.
Ella hangs up the phone and approaches the reception.
Head Nurse and Clerk watch her in astonishment.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Where’s my husband?
The Clerk points to the adjoining waiting room.
While in the kitchen Will asks:
WILL
So what’s happening?
Jane watches Lillian and stutters:
JANE
Nothing. Everything’s fine.
LILLIAN
But where are they?

The

Scene 55

JANE
I have no idea, but Mom seems
very... energized. And she sends
her love to you, Lillian.
LILLIAN
Isn’t that sweet...

Ella sees John in the waiting room, quietly watching a
basketball game on the TV with some other patients.
Ella’s still upset, but her anger has given way to
bitterness. She touches John’s shoulder. He turns and smiles
as if nothing has happened.
JOHN
Hi, darling Ella.
ELLA
I understand everything. That night
you came home - remember? I smelled
of wax, or was it oil? Vinegar?
DDT? I was cleaning the floor. All
hot and sweaty. Seven months
pregnant.
JOHN
(bewildered)
What?
The employees have reached them and are cautiously trying to
intervene:
CLERK
Ma’am? Is everything all right? Can
we call someone to come get you?
Ella is offended.
ELLA
Can’t you see that I’m speaking
with my husband?
The Head Nurse exchanges a look with the Clerk, who seems
even more frightened. Ella turns to John and continues.
ELLA (CONT’D)
You didn’t say anything, but you
got down on all fours to help.
Then, while I was taking a bath,
you got in the tub with me.
(MORE)

Scene 55

Page 104.
ELLA (CONT’D)
I didn’t know anything, but I
sensed you were back. And although
I knew nothing, I forgave you.

Who knows how much John understands. He kisses her hand. Then
he gestures to the man who sits watching the game in the
chair next to him.
JOHN
This chap likes the Bulls. Raymond
Chandler was a Bulls fan.
Hemingway loved bulls. But that
was in Spain.
The Clerk talks to them as if they were spoiled children:
CLERK
You really should be going. It’s
Mr. Davidson’s bedtime.
Ella takes John by the hand and pulls him up:
ELLA
Don’t worry. I’m not leaving my
husband in this dump to be treated
like a fool. Come on John.
John gets up nimbly, and when he sees Ella walking with
difficulty, he takes her arm.
JOHN
Lean on me, sweetheart.
ELLA
And now I have to forgive you all
over again. 48 years later.
John understands nothing of what she’s saying, but seems to
sense her conciliatory tone.
JOHN
Thank you, Ella.
ELLA
I don’t know if I’m a bitch or
you’re a son of a bitch.
John stops for a second, thinking about it.
JOHN
I guess anything’s possible.

And out they go through the glass doors: he’s vacant but
strong, she’s crippled but lucid. The two of them forming one
whole person.

INT. CAMPER, MOVING DOWN THE OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

The Leisure Seeker seems to skip the surface of the water as
it follows the Overseas Highway through the Keys. John drives
while Ella is stuck to him like a Band-Aid. John struggles to
maneuver, but Ella doesn’t relax her embrace.
ELLA
Could you pull over, John?
Why?

JOHN

ELLA
Let’s get down to look.
JOHN
Do you think a guy can get a burger
up here?
Ella loses her patience immediately.
ELLA
John, pull this camper over
immediately. I want to get out and
look.
John obeys. Ella opens the door and gets down. She walks to
the edge of the bridge, suspended between water and sky. John
reaches her after a moment. She hears him coming but does not
turn around. She speaks as she takes in nature’s sublimity:
ELLA (CONT’D)
Look, John. It’s so beautiful.
John looks around in bewilderment.
JOHN
Are we there?
Almost.

JOHN
Is this heaven?

John and Ella have hooked up the Leisure Seeker in a campsite
and, along with other guests, board a shuttle. John waits on
a bench with other guests to board a shuttle. He continues to
read his new favorite book, “Nature Pop-Ups Land Life.” He
points out the pop-up animals to a bemused TEXAN with a
cowboy hat sitting next to him.
JOHN

Hemingway shot one of these.
(points to giraffe) But not one of
these.

INT./EXT. HEMINGWAY HOUSE - DAY.

Hemingway’s house is crowded with tourists. There’s the
restaurant, a shop full of souvenirs, tour guides who explain
the same things in the same words to different groups. Weird,
slightly evil cats lounge everywhere, photographed by phones
and posted immediately on Facebook. Ella is very disappointed
by the place, which seems to her to be as bogus as the set of
a TV show. She looks at John, mortified. But John doesn’t
seem disappointed at all. In fact, he throws himself into a
wedding ceremony taking place in the special wedding site on
the house’s grounds. He wanders happily among the guests, as
if they were his relatives. In the drunken chaos, no one
seems to mind him. They are from Miami, a mixture of Anglos
and Latinos; they make a real racket. John toasts strangers;

Scene 58

Page 106A.

he even joins the group photo. Ella descends the porch stairs
and tries to take him by the arm, to get him out of there.
ELLA
Enough of this farce, John. No one
will believe this.
JOHN
But Ella - Gary and Marisol are
getting married!

Scene 58

Page 107.

There’s a large banner in which the names are interwoven in a
heart. Ella’s not nervous, she’s afflicted with pain.
ELLA
I’m sorry. You’ve wanted to come
for so many years. And look at it.
But John is no longer hearing her. He’s drawn to the bride
and her bridesmaids, who have lined up to dance, their white
dresses glowing against the deep green lawn. Someone puts on:
CUBAN SALSA TIMBA DANCE MUSIC
The girls in white begin to dance deliriously, all together,
as if possessed. John watches this ecstacy, and there’s a
hint of the dance in his own feet.
Ella, meanwhile, is stricken by a wave of nausea. She
soundlessly calls out. John doesn’t hear her, he doesn’t
notice. Ella goes in search of a bathroom to throw up. She’s
giddy and sweating. She cannot reach the toilet - she’s
gripped by a dizzy spell that sends her to the ground. She
loses consciousness. Nearby visitors call for help.
VISITORS SUMMON HELP
In the garden, John is overwhelmed by the song, by how the
wedding guests sing together as the girls dance, like the
whole thing was choreographed:
In the house, paramedics load Ella onto a stretcher. No one
notices her little golden purse that lies on the ground just
outside the bathroom door. She seems to have a glimmer of
understanding as they load her on the ambulance. She realizes
what’s happening, that John is not with her.
ELLA (CONT’D)
John. My husband.
She hasn’t the strength to protest more strongly; her voice
is just a whisper.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Leave me alone. Please, I beg you.
I can’t go. John. Leave me...
The paramedics don’t hear her. As they close the ambulance
doors, Ella is overcome by feelings of illness and
exhaustion. She’s taken away mumbling:
ELLA (CONT’D)
John. John.

Scene 58

Page 108.

Working with cool efficiency, the paramedics put an oxygen
mask over her mouth, then pierce a vein and insert a drip.
The ambulance rushes off with siren screaming.
John walks into the house in a daze. He looks around in
amazement. He gazes at Hemingway’s desk, which holds an old
Remington, just like his back home. He studies the framed
photos of the great writer in the company of Fidel and Che;
or marlin fishing on his boat Pilar. But there's something
missing. He’s lost something, but he cannot remember what it
is. He approaches a young female GUIDE.
Excuse me.
Yes, sir.

JOHN
GUIDE

JOHN
I’m looking for...
GUIDE
Looking for...?
JOHN
Help me, please.
The Guide speaks to him like he’s a child.
GUIDE
Are you looking for the bathroom?
It’s out back by the souvenir shop.
Do you feel okay?
JOHN
Thank you, miss. You’re very
helpful.
He follows her directions. In the hallway outside the
bathroom, he sees Ella’s golden purse on the ground. He
stops, perplexed. It reminds him of something. He picks it
up, opens it, pulls out a lipstick and sniffs it.

John sits in front of a couple of doctors, who are speaking
very seriously, as if he could possibly understand them.
FIRST DOCTOR
...in order to figure out what was
causing these symptoms we did a
full body CAT scan. We certainly
didn’t expect a situation as grave
as what we found.
SECOND DOCTOR
The original tumor was in the
colon, wasn’t it, Mr. Spencer?
John understands that he is being questioned.
JOHN
I... yes, uh-huh, I’m John Spencer.
The doctors attribute his vagueness to a state of shock.
FIRST DOCTOR
But now there’s been a bloodborne
spread through the lymphatic
system, attacking almost all
internal organs.

Scene 60

Page 110.
SECOND DOCTOR
To be honest, Mr. Spencer, it’s
amazing that she’s even alive with
her blood chemistry readings.
FIRST DOCTOR
Were you really taking an RV trip?

John looks at them, blinks, and asks:
JOHN
Where is my wife?
CUT TO:
Ella’s in her hospital bed, attached to a drip, monitored,
half her face covered by an oxygen mask. The door opens and a
young CUBAN NURSE enters with John, who has her purse in
hand.
Ella opens her eyes as John approaches, then opens them wider
in amazement. She pulls away the oxygen mask.
ELLA
Oh my god, John, how’d you get
here?
JOHN
I brought you this.
She kisses him on the lips, then realizes that the nurse is
watching from the door.
ELLA
A little privacy, please.
Oh, sorry.

CUBAN NURSE

She closes the door. Ella takes the purse and immediately
applies some make-up to her face, using the tiny mirror.
ELLA
It’s so amazing that you found me.
Who helped you?
Let’s go.

JOHN

She caresses John’s face, deeply moved.

Scene 60

Page 111.
ELLA
I don’t know, hon. I don’t think
they’re going to release me now
that they’ve caught me.

But John stubbornly pulls back her covers and takes her hand.
He sees her shoes and arranges them beneath the side of the
bed, inviting her to get down. He drapes his jacket over the
shoulders of her hospital gown.
JOHN
We’ll go, now.
CUT TO:
They move through a crowded corridor, walking slowly, John
carefully supporting his wife. They pass by the reception
desk. Ella, wearing John’s jacket, is in great pain and
deeply confused. She looks around, not understanding how to
get out of here. She straightens her wig and, acting like a
visitor, stops a passing nurse:
ELLA
Excuse me, where’s the exit?
The nurse, oblivious, shows the way out.

Carefully he lowers her to the bed. She’s exhausted and he’s
having trouble breathing. He stands in front of the bed, his
hand outstretched against the wall for balance, as he tries
to catch his breath. She looks at him.
ELLA
You need to change, John. Your
clean shorts are in the bottom
drawer. You’ll have to excuse me
for not helping.
You rest.

He moves away from the wall. Regains his balance. Breathing
okay, now John takes off his soaked trousers, puts on his night-shirt,
while she takes a bottle of Valium from her bag.
ELLA
We both need a good nap. I’d given
up hope in the hospital; I didn’t
think I’d see our Leisure Seeker
ever again.
She’s filled a glass with many drops of tranquilizer. She
hands it to John.
ELLA (CONT’D)
Drink half of this. Look at you,
you didn’t even wash. Come here.
As John drinks, she gets some wet wipes from a packet on the
nightstand.
Come on.

ELLA (CONT’D)

John obeys. She lifts his night shirt and cleans between his
thighs. Something happens that makes her laugh.

ELLA (CONT’D)
Oh, goodness!

John smiles as well, proud of his unexpected erection. He
takes her hand and puts it on his cock.
JOHN
Hello, sweetheart.
ELLA
(to his cock)
Well done. But you can stand downBut John thinks otherwise. He lifts her hospital gown.
He maneuvers above her, on all fours. He starts gently to
open her legs
ELLA (CONT’D)
(conscious of impending
pain)
What are you doing?
JOHN
(total concentration)
Will you hand me the ‘what’s it’
there, please
ELLA
The face creme?
She reaches for the tube/jar of creme on the night table.
John takes it and puts some on his cock and on her vagina
ELLA (CONT’D)
I don’t think I can, John.
JOHN
We’ll try. Just for a second Very, very carefully he penetrates her JOHN (CONT’D)
Okay? Is it bearable?
ELLA
Yes, darling. Yes. I’m okay After a moment he stope his push into her. Their pubic bones
are together-

JOHN
(quietly astounded)
I’m there ELLA
Yes - there

He is dead still, looking down at her. He sees just the
faintest grimaces of discomfort in her eyes
JOHN
(hardly breathing)
Still all right? ELLA
(smiling slowly)
Yes. All right.
They lie still, then Ella starts to slowly move JOHN
Don’t move ELLA
(looking at him)
You don’t want to come?
JOHN
No, just this Ella reaches up to his face and pulls him down to her lips
and very gently kisses him. There is an air of ethereal bliss
about them ELLA
I love you, John JOHN
All my life, my darling. All my
lifeThey lie there very still feeling every part of their
Aristophanic selves united and then, very gradually, he
starts to withdraw from her - Ella watches him. He
concentrates deliberately on his action
Finally, as if in slow motion, John moves off her and lies
beside her.
He is on her right side, his right hand moves between her
legs and encloses her vagina -

ELLA
(deeply moved)
This was perfectJOHN
Just perfect. Thank you, my darling
girl. You are very, very beautiful -

They lie there, the two of them, together, a whisper of s
smile, eyes closed, in a state of outer-worldly wonder and
peace.
CUT TO:
When she reopens them, it’s pitch black outside. John snores.
Ella gets up with difficulty, careful not to wake him.
At the small table, she finishes the letter she’s been
writing all trip. She folds it, writes ‘To Jane and Will’ on
the back, then leaves it on the table. She downs the
remaining half-glass of extra-strength Valium.
She goes to the driver’s seat and starts the motor.
She bends down to the floor with a deep sigh to remove the
mat that covers the trap door. She rips off the tape. Exhaust
fumes begin to spread through the cabin. She joins John in
bed and hugs him. The fumes thicken, making everything fuzzy
and opalescent.
An image from outside: The Leisure Seeker vibrates with the
engine running under a full moon.
ELLA V/O
My darling Jane and Will. Here’s
our lawyer’s number: I’ve taken
care of everything, all the
arrangements. There’s nothing for
you to worry about, although I
think our final Visa bill will be
outrageous. We had a bit of fun
there at the end.

EXT. KEY WEST CAMPSITE - MORNING

64

The following morning, the Texan is having breakfast with his
wife. He sees that the Leisure Seeker’s engine is running.
Perplexed, he goes to knock on the door. Then he opens it.
ELLA V/O
...I’m so sorry to hurt you like
this.

Scene 64

Page 116.
ELLA V/O (CONT'D)
I know how painful it must be. But
pretty soon you’re going to feel
something else. Relief. Relief
that you won’t have to watch our
bodies and our minds fade away.
Relief that the burden we were
becoming has been lifted from your
shoulders. And you musn’t feel
guilty about that...you musn’t.

A deeply upset Texan emerges from the Leisure Seeker, calling
for help. Other campers flock to the scene, joined by
campsite staff. One of them enters the camper to turn off the
engine, while someone else calls 911.
ELLA V/O (CONT’D)
I loved your father. Very much. I
didn’t have much longer, and I
couldn’t leave him alone. We were
always together. And I hope we’re
together somewhere now. Who knows?

EXT. BOSTON CEMETERY - DAY.

64

The funeral’s in their home town cemetery. Will is there, as
is Jane, with her husband and their children: 21 year-old
Rose and 19 year-old Stephen. Many old friends. And Lillian,
who seems the saddest of all.
ELLA V/O
This was our last wonderful
vacation. We had some beautiful
days. It was our happy ending.
As they walk away, Jane keeps a close eye on her brother,
worried that he will not be able to handle this.
Will folds his mother’s letter and puts it in his pocket.
He’s read and re-read it many times. He catches his sister’s
eye:
JANE
How you doing, kiddo? Sad?
And he, with a bittersweet smile, shakes his head. He puts
his arm around her waist and they walk off together.
THE END
