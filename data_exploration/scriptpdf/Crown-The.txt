INT. THRONE ROOM - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DUSK

1

A series of faces. Stern. Tense. Formidable. The faces of the
British Establishment.
CAPTION: “19th NOVEMBER, 1947”
King George VI, the Lord Chamberlain, the Master of the
Household, the Secretary of the Central Chancery, The King’s
Private Secretary (Lascelles), the Lord Chancellor, (keeper
of the Privy Seal), the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, two
members of the privy Council, and the Home Secretary.
All are assembled in a rich, baroque room at Buckingham
Palace, necks craned, watching intently as..
A fountain pen scratches across parchment. The 26-year-old
PHILIP MOUNTBATTEN signs his name..
LORD CHAMBERLAIN
Here, Sir.
Once.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN
And here.
Twice.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN
Thank you, Sir.
Three times. Intricate legal documents. Then PHILIP kneels in
anticipation as his father-in-law-to-be anoints him..
KING GEORGE
Philip Mountbatten, Baron Greenwich,
Earl of Merioneth, Duke of Edinburgh..
The KING puts a wide blue sash over PHILIP’s shoulder, then
pins a medal to his chest, a gleaming Garter Star.
KING GEORGE
...Knight of the Garter.
PHILIP rises. Shakes the KING’s hand.
PHILIP
Thank you, Sir.
Silence in the room. One or two eyes look away. Throats
cleared. People check their watches. There is no one present
for whom this is a particularly happy moment.

2.

INT. CENTRE ROOM - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - SAME TIME

2

But there is one person who is happy about this.
PRINCESS ELIZABETH, the 21-year-old heir to the throne, who
waits in a neighbouring room..
She stares out of a window. A window etched with raindrops.
Looking out into the Mall. The real world. A world she barely
knows. The Royal Standard fluttering in the wind.
Presently, from next door, the sound of doors opening. The
dark rumble of male voices and laughter.
ELIZABETH goes to the door. Walks out into the corridor.
3

INT. CORRIDOR - PALACE - DAY

3

She sees all the white-haired men emerging from the
investiture in conversation.
Walking off together. Familiar to one another. Friends.
Members of the same club. Finally PHILIP emerges.
Handsome and immaculate. Naval uniform. Garter sash. Medals.
But something unmistakably dangerous about him, too.
Not part of the ‘club’.
ELIZABETH stares at him. Still the swooning fourteen year old
girl with a rebellious crush she was the day she met him.
ELIZABETH
How was it? “Your Royal Highness?”
He lights a cigarette.
PHILIP
They got through it. I got through it.
He looks at her. The blunt humour. The hint of danger.
PHILIP
Think they’d all have preferred a
nice, pink-faced Marquis with a grouse
moor in the Scottish Borders.
(feigns seriousness)
Are you sure you wouldn’t have
preferred one of those?
ELIZABETH watches PHILIP inhale deeply.
ELIZABETH
Must you smoke? You know how I hate
it.

3.

PHILIP
Pity. Because I love it so very much.
And like a great many other things,
I’m going to give it all up...for you.
He takes a last puff. Savours it. Eyes closed. Then breaks
into a smile, and stubs it out.
ELIZABETH
You’ve still got twenty-four hours to
change your mind.
PHILIP
No. You’ll be marrying a non-smoker.
ELIZABETH
I meant about everything.
PHILIP
What? You think I can still change my
mind, now?
He indicates his Garter sash. His medal. His ‘rewards’.
PHILIP
I’ve signed myself away.
ELIZABETH
Or won the biggest prize on earth.
PHILIP
That’s certainly what they think.
He looks at her. His face softens.
PHILIP
It’s what I think, too.
He kisses her on the forehead.
PHILIP
See you tomorrow. Try to get some
sleep.
ELIZABETH
You, too.
PHILIP
A naval officer’s stag night? Chance’d
be a fine thing.
He goes.

EXT. DORCHESTER HOTEL - NIGHT
Cars arriving outside the central London hotel.

INT. DORCHESTER HOTEL - NIGHT

5

PHILIP’s stag party. A group of his fellow naval officers and
friends. Everyone in starched white Naval evening dress.
Impossibly elegant.
The EARL OF MOUNTBATTEN (briefly back from India) is the
senior guest along with various captains and 1st lieutenants
from 27th Destroyer Flotilla.
At that moment a pack of press PHOTOGRAPHERS are invited in
to take photographs.
MOUNTBATTEN
Who let them in?
A ripple of groans as the Naval officers reluctantly agree to
let the photographers take some photos.
MOUNTBATTEN
(barks authoritatively)
Sixty seconds, that’s all you’ve got.
MOUNTBATTEN turns to PHILIP as they pose for the shots.
MOUNTBATTEN
So, what’s it to be? After the
honeymoon?
PHILIP
I’m aiming for Malta.
MOUNTBATTEN
Very wise. A nice naval officer’s
posting overseas. Away from court. The
two of you’ll be able to totally
disappear into the background, and
live like normal people.
(calling out)
Thirty seconds!
The PHOTOGRAPHERS continue to take pictures. MOUNTBATTEN
stays close to PHILIP...
MOUNTBATTEN
Speaking of normal people, I spoke to
the Lord Chancellor, who confirmed
what I always suspected; that the
Proclamation Act of 1917 which changed
the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
to Windsor made one significant
omission.
PHILIP
Namely?

5.

MOUNTBATTEN
It failed to include George V's FEMALE
descendants.
(barks to PHOTOGRAPHERS)
That’s enough now.
But the PHOTOGRAPHERS continue without heeding MOUNTBATTEN.
MOUNTBATTEN
It means those females, of whom the
woman you’re marrying is one, are free
to behave like every other NORMAL
woman in the country, and take their
names from...
PHILIP
From?
MOUNTBATTEN
Their husbands. Which would mean a
royal house, in your name, dear boy.
‘Mountbatten’.
PHILIP
But it’s not my real name, Uncle. It’s
my adoptive name.
MOUNTBATTEN
True.
PHILIP
A name I took to make me acceptable to
the British establishment. To stop me
appearing to be the rootless foreigner
they all think I am. And since the
name I took is YOURS, it would be a
royal house not in MY name, so much as
YOURS.
MOUNTBATTEN shrugs, feigning innocence.
MOUNTBATTEN
If you insist.
6

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - ELIZABETH’S ROOM - NIGHT
ELIZABETH is in her room. Reading a book. A scratch at the
door, then it opens.
MARGARET, her younger sister enters.
MARGARET
Can’t sleep. You?
ELIZABETH
No.

6

6.

MARGARET
So much noise outside. Have you had a
look?
ELIZABETH
I looked earlier. When I went to bed.
MARGARET
How many were there then?
ELIZABETH
Eighty? A hundred?
MARGARET
Have another look now.
ELIZABETH gets out of bed, walks over to the window.
Outside: a sea of several thousand people waiting in the
MALL.
MARGARET
Have they nothing better to do?
MARGARET looks at ELIZABETH.
MARGARET
Nervous?
ELIZABETH
A little.
MARGARET
Not a lot? Not absolutely terrified
and falling apart inside?
ELIZABETH
What’d be the point of that? That’d be
no use to anyone.
MARGARET
Typical Lilibet. Coping heroically. As
always. No fuss.
MARGARET yawns.
MARGARET
I’d better try to get some sleep, I
want to look irresistible tomorrow.
ELIZABETH
Who for?
MARGARET
Someone.
ELIZABETH
Who?

7.

MARGARET
Someone unsuitable.
ELIZABETH
How unsuitable?
MARGARET
VERY unsuitable.
ELIZABETH
Who?
MARGARET smiles enigmatically, heads for the door..
ELIZABETH
Margaret? You can’t just go..
But MARGARET does.
ELIZABETH is left by the window. She looks out one more
time...hiding from view...
Then draws the curtains shut.

EXT. 28 HYDE PARK GATE - CHURCHILL RESIDENCE - DAY

7

To establish: a private address. Number 28, Hyde Park Gate. A
brick house in a cul-de-sac, off Kensington Road. In close
proximity to the House of Commons. The Churchill residence.
8

INT. 28 HYDE PARK GATE - CHURCHILL RESIDENCE - DAY
73-year-old WINSTON CHURCHILL wheezes, puffs, short of
breath, as he finishes getting dressed in morning coat. An
almighty exertion. Clearly not a well man.
A knock at the door. His wife, CLEMMIE (62), pops her head
around the door...
CLEMMIE
C’mon. We’re late.
WINSTON looks up with difficulty.
WINSTON
Almost there.
CLEMMIE
Very late.
CLEMMIE goes. CHURCHILL straightens, a cunning glint in his
eye. We realize his slowness is intentional.
“Snap”, a moment later the door opens again...

8

8.

CLEMMIE
Unbecomingly late.
CLEMMIE goes. CHURCHILL slows down again. Taking his time.
“Snap”, the door opens. CLEMMIE reappears, and barks.
CLEMMIE
Unpardonably late!
9

INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY

9

Theatre of pomp and circumstance; the pre-eminent religious
cathedral in the United Kingdom. Since 1066, the traditional
place of coronation and burial for British monarchs.
Today the Abbey is full. Two thousand five hundred guests.
Entire Royal dynasties, Heads of State. The men spectacular
in morning dress or uniforms and the ladies wear floor-length
dresses, elbow-length white gloves, jewels and tiaras or
hats, many with feathered plumes.
Heads turn as the QUEEN and QUEEN MARY arrive. Both Queens
sporting Garter badges and sashes. The organist plays.
10

10

EXT. STREETS - DAY

The Irish State Coach (blue and black, with gilt decoration,
and red-spoked wheels) carrying PRINCESS ELIZABETH and her
father. They talk between waves to streets lined with people.
ELIZABETH
I’ve asked Mummy already, but maybe I
should ask you. From a man’s
perspective.
KING GEORGE
What?
ELIZABETH
What it takes?
KING GEORGE
What it takes to what?
He looks at his daughter.
KING GEORGE
Oh..
(thinks)
Do not look for perfection in him. Or
yourself. Be patient, flexible and
understanding.
ELIZABETH
Right.

9.

KING GEORGE
Learn to forgive and forget.
ELIZABETH
I’ll try.
KING GEORGE
Stand together facing the world.
And never forget to say “sorry” and
“thank you”. Twenty times a day.
ELIZABETH
That often?
KING GEORGE
At least! And remember always that
independence is equal, dependence is
mutual, and obligation is reciprocal.
The coach is stopped. Uniformed POLICEMEN confer with the
driver.
The KING is dressed in the uniform of the Admiral of the
Fleet. He looks up, irritated.
KING GEORGE
What’s going on?
The FOOTMAN steps down. Embarrassed.
FOOTMAN
Still waiting on one guest, Sir.
KING GEORGE
What??
FOOTMAN
I’m told his car’s pulling in now. So
we’ll be on our way shortly.
The FOOTMAN goes. The KING shakes his head, tutting to
himself.
KING GEORGE
He’s got nerve. You have to give him
that.
ELIZABETH
You know who it is?
ELIZABETH wears a pearl and crystal encrusted ivory silk
dress, with a 15ft train. Tiara and necklace.
KING GEORGE
My dear, there’s only ONE MAN ON EARTH
that’d have the temerity to keep the
King of England waiting on the day of
his daughter’s wedding.

10.

11

EXT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY

11

Car doors open, and WINSTON CHURCHILL gets out, with his
wife, CLEMMIE. It’s the arrival of a movie star.
12

INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY

12

CHURCHILL enters the Abbey with CLEMMIE. The last guest. It's
a dramatic, theatrical entrance.
As he enters, heads turn, and then something happens that
will be talked about for generations to come.
One by one, the assembled Crown Heads of Europe - the
loftiest guest list in the world - gets to its feet.
The King and Queen of Denmark, the King of Norway, Prince
Regent and Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands, King Michael
and the Queen Mother of Romania, Queen Frederika of Greece,
the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden, the King of Iraq,
the Prince Regent of Belgium, the Prince and Princess of
Luxembourg, the Count of Barcelona and his mother Queen Ena
of Spain...
All rise out of respect.
Also in the congregation, the dashing ANTHONY EDEN looks at
his friends, and gets, reluctantly, to his feet.
EDEN
Oh for God’s sake.
SALISBURY
The man really has no shame.
A gang of Conservative plotters watch hatefully as CHURCHILL
milks the moment - ‘BOBBETY’ SALISBURY, along with HARRY
CROOKSHANK, JAMES STUART, ANTHONY EDEN, and OTHERS.
SALISBURY
You realise this is for our benefit.
EDEN
Oh, I know. And also a little bit for
our Prime Minister.
CLEMENT ATTLEE, the Prime Minister, rolls his eyes and
deliberately - pointedly - remains seated.
He is dressed in a simple lounge suit, surrounded by several
ancient, wheezing, socialists; battle-weary, dilapidated
members of the Labour Cabinet, also in lounge suits,
(STAFFORD CRIPPS, ERNEST BEVIN).
A striking contrast to the majority of morningsuited/uniformed men in the congregation.

11.

CHURCHILL finally reaches his seat.
A fanfare of trumpets. The 21-year-old Elizabeth enters,
accompanied by the King. The procession walks down the aisle
led by choir boys of the Chapel Royal, followed by the
various deans, bishops and archbishops.
13

INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - LATER

13

ELIZABETH and PHILIP kneel before the altar on boxes draped
in rose-coloured silk.
The ARCHBISHOP turns to ELIZABETH.
ARCHBISHOP
Elizabeth, wilt thou have this Man to
be thy wedded Husband, to live
together after God's ordinance in the
holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
obey him, and serve him, love, honour,
and keep him in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him, so long as ye
both shall live?
ELIZABETH
I will.
14

INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - SAME TIME

14

CHURCHILL scowls disapprovingly from his place in the
congregation, then whispers loudly to CLEMMIE.
WINSTON
It’s a mistake I tell you.
CLEMMIE
Sssshh!!
WINSTON
Who is this immigrant foundling we’re
ushering into our palaces?
Heads turn in the row in front of him.
WINSTON
Just three weeks ago he renounced his
religion. Greek Orthodox! His sisters
have not been invited. Why? Because
each is married to Nazis.
(indicates)
Just look at his relatives!
CHURCHILL nods in the direction of a group of European royal
guests seated on the other side.

12.

WINSTON
A motley collection of fugitive royal
beggars who’ve crawled out of their
hiding places and garrets. Our
princess was born in a palace, into
the most evolved monarchy in Western
Europe. He was born on a kitchen table
in Corfu.
CHURCHILL indicates the tall, imposing figure of MOUNTBATTEN,
done out in top naval rig, with his wife LADY MOUNTBATTEN,
sporting two enormous, too flamboyant feathered plumes on her
head...
WINSTON
This whole thing is Mountbatten’s
triumph. He engineered it all.
(with evident disdain)
The man who gave India away.
15

INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - LATER

15

Meanwhile, back at the altar..
ELIZABETH
I Elizabeth Alexandra Mary take thee
Philip, to be my wedded Husband, to
have and to hold from this day
forward, for better for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in
health, to love, cherish, and to obey,
till death us do part, according to
God's holy ordinance; and thereto I
give thee my troth.
PHILIP puts the ring on ELIZABETH’s finger.
PHILIP
With this ring I thee wed, with my
body I thee worship, and with all my
worldly Goods I thee endow: In the
Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
The ARCHBISHOP extends his hands..
ARCHBISHOP
Let us pray. O ETERNAL God, Creator
and Preserver of all mankind, Giver of
all spiritual grace...
16

INT. ST. EDWARD’S CHAPEL - DAY

16

The bride and groom sign the register in a small chapel off
the main Abbey.

13.

As do the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dean of Westminster,
the KING and QUEEN, Philip's MOTHER and the ancient QUEEN
MARY. As they sign we hear...
ARCHBISHOP (V.O.)
...the Author of everlasting life;
Send thy blessing upon these thy
servants, this Man and this Woman,
whom we bless in thy Name; that they
may ever remain in perfect love and
peace together, and live according to
thy laws; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.
(a beat)
Those whom God hath joined together
let no man put asunder.
17

INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY

17

Mendelsohn's “Wedding March” plays as everyone exits the
Abbey through the West Door.
KING GEORGE finds himself next to CHURCHILL. A warm greeting
between the two men.
KING GEORGE
Would it be very unconstitutional of
me to say how much I miss our weekly
chats?
KING GEORGE indicates the Labour Prime Minister, CLEMENT
ATTLEE, a few steps behind them.
KING GEORGE
You successor is..
(tails off)
Well, it would be indiscrete of me to
say.
WINSTON
Then allow me to say it for you. “Last
week an empty taxi pulled up outside
the House of Commons, and Mr. Attlee
got out.”
KING GEORGE laughs. The two evidently firm friends.
KING GEORGE
I shall never understand how he and
his party won the election, after
you’d won us the war.
WINSTON
Nor I, Sir. And now look at the mess
they’ve got us in.

14.

They walk past the same group of senior Conservative
plotters, led by the dashing EDEN - fed up with CHURCHILL
still being leader of their Party.
EDEN scowls as he sees CHURCHILL.
EDEN
If it weren’t hurting the party so
much, you’d have to admire his
tenacity.
SALISBURY
He should have stepped down as Leader
when he lost us the election last
time. Even his wife pleaded with him
not to carry on, thought his loss a
blessing in disguise. The old fool
should step down now.
EDEN
Can you see him doing it?
SALISBURY
No. He’ll cling on forever. Unless of
course...
EDEN
Of course..?
SALISBURY
He’s pushed.
(a meaningful look)
By the person the party and the
country wants to see replace him.
EDEN’s face: knowing what SALISBURY says is true.
18

INT. ST JAMES’ PALACE - DAY
ELIZABETH and PHILIP are shown into a large baroque room.
ELIZABETH
Goodness.
PHILIP
(under his breath)
Christ.
REVERSE ANGLE: now we see what they are staring at. A room
literally packed to the ceiling with gifts.
KING GEORGE
Did we count them yet?

18

15.

LASCELLES
Two thousand five hundred gifts, Sir.
And ten thousand telegrams of
congratulation.
KING GEORGE
And I thought we’d done well.
QUEEN MOTHER
Nothing close to this.
MARGARET is excitedly taking photos.
PHILIP
Don’t let anyone see those pictures.
Two million people out of work out
there. Still starving on rations.
MARGARET
Oh, don’t be such a stick in the mud.
If people are gloomy out there, we can
always open this place up, put the
presents on show, it’d cheer everyone
up.
QUEEN MOTHER
And we can charge them a schilling to
come and look at them.
PHILIP
If they had any sense they’d storm the
palaces. Have our heads on spikes.
KING GEORGE
How do you want to do this? We can
have people help you open them, make a
list. Then we’ll get the secretaries
to start drafting letters of thanks.
ELIZABETH
No. We’ll do it all ourselves, won’t
we?
PHILIP
Will we?
ELIZABETH
Of course.
PHILIP nervously feels his neck.
19

INT. BEDROOM - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT
ELIZABETH walks into their bedroom.
ELIZABETH
Did you have a favourite?

19

16.

PHILIP
I’d have to say the tray cloth spun by
Gandhi at his own wheel.
ELIZABETH
Oh, I thought that VERY indelicate.
Mummy said it looked like a loincloth.
We had the motif translated. You know
what it said? “Jai Hind”
PHILIP
What’s that?
ELIZABETH
“Victory for India.”
PHILIP laughs.
PHILIP
How about you?
ELIZABETH
Margaret gave me a picnic basket,
which I thought VERY practical. But
best of all was this.
ELIZABETH holds open a box. Inside a Super 8 camera.
PHILIP
Who’s that from?
ELIZABETH
Papa.
PHILIP
You’re not going to use it now, are
you?
ELIZABETH
Is that a dare?
The two fall into one another’s arms. The camera lies on the
bed.
FADE TO BLACK:
20

FLICKERING SUPER 8 FOOTAGE

20

A newborn infant cries into the lens of the Super-8 camera.
ELIZABETH and PHILIP play with their new baby, CHARLES in the
garden at Sandringham. GEORGE struggles to unhook Charles’
cardigan - which has become caught on Elizabeth’s brooch...

17.

21

FLICKERING SUPER 8 FOOTAGE

PHILIP is in white naval uniform. He and ELIZABETH kiss their
baby son goodbye...
22

FLICKERING SUPER 8 FOOTAGE

Malta. PHILIP is on a naval frigate, the Magpie. Inspecting
his subordinate officers and sailors - who line up and salute
him in respect. He wears sunglasses - dapper and confident.
23

FLICKERING SUPER 8 FOOTAGE

27

FLICKERING SUPER 8 FOOTAGE

27

ELIZABETH is on the telephone, listening intently.
Her expression changes. Suddenly serious. She gestures to
PHILIP to stop filming.
28

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

28

KING GEORGE VI is undergoing an operation at the Palace. A
large team of doctors (nine), surgeons, nurses.
29

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

29

ELIZABETH, PHILIP, QUEEN MARY, QUEEN ELIZABETH, MARGARET and
several senior courtiers are sitting in a room.

18.

No one speaks. Profound concern on everyone’s faces.
Eventually the lead SURGEON enters the room.
He manages a reassuring smile. The operation has gone
satisfactorily. Relief breaks out in the room.
OVER THIS: the sound of a radio.
RADIO
...in the weeks leading up to the
election the Tories had a comfortable
lead in the polls, but it now looks
like - come election day - that margin
has become increasingly narrow, and
the outcome is now too close to
call...
30

INT. YELLOW DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

30

The still-recuperating KING and QUEEN are sitting in a room
listening to the wireless.
But we notice that this is a diminished KING - frail,
vulnerable, older-looking - a man who has undergone numerous
operations - most recently one to remove his left lung.
The FOOTMEN enter bringing food.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Did you send for food?
KING GEORGE
(hoarsely)
I did. Looks like it’s going to be a
long night.
(to FOOTMAN)
The fire, please?
(rubbing hands)
A nail-biter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH smiles - glad that the KING is taking
interest in things again.
The FOOTMAN goes to put some more logs on the fire.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Mulligatawny?
The QUEEN smells the soup and groans.
KING GEORGE
Yummy.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Marmalade sandwiches?

19.

KING GEORGE
Heaven.
The QUEEN’s face falls. Puts the lid back on the soup.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Would you mind if I left you to bite
your nails on your own?
KING GEORGE
Not at all.
(putting on napkin)
All the more for me.
The QUEEN reaches the door. Manages a concerned smile. The
KING erupts into a fit of COUGHING.
31

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

31

QUEEN ELIZABETH is in her bedroom, speaking on the telephone
to her eldest daughter.
QUEEN MOTHER
I’m so happy he’s eating again. Even
if what he’s eating is inedible, and
I’m glad he’s taking an interest in
the election.
(a beat)
Will you be able to follow it? Where
are you? Vancouver?
32

INT. BRITISH EMBASSY - WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

32

PRINCESS ELIZABETH, now 25, and the mother of two young
children, is in an Embassy reception room, on the telephone
to her mother.
(We intercut between the two locations as necessary).
ELIZABETH
Washington. We’ve come to America for
a few days. Philip’s downstairs.
Listening on the wireless.
QUEEN MOTHER
Who will he be cheering for? The other
side?
ELIZABETH
You’d have to ask him.
QUEEN MOTHER
I don’t need to. It’s obvious. He’s a
leftist, just like his Uncle. He can’t
actually BELIEVE what they stand for.
I expect he does it just to annoy us.

20.

ELIZABETH
You might give him a bit more credit
than that.
QUEEN MOTHER
How is he? You said he was unsettled
last week.
ELIZABETH
Still a bit unsettled. But looking
forward to coming home tomorrow. Try
to look at it from his point of view.
He was happy in Malta. Very happy. And
then we were asked to return...
QUEEN MOTHER
When your father became ill.
ELIZABETH
But if you want to know why he gnashes
sometimes...that’s the explanation.
QUEEN MOTHER
He’d sooner be in billeted
accommodation in Malta than Clarence
House in London?
ELIZABETH
He’d sooner be in the Navy. That’s his
life. And frankly the one community
that’s been a real family to him.
The QUEEN MOTHER looks up.
QUEEN MOTHER
Why? Whatever’s wrong with US?
33

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - MORNING

33

Daylight fills the corridors.
A mouse busying itself in a corner. It sits up, then scurries
for safety as it hears...
...the sound of approaching footsteps...
34

THREE PAIRS OF POLISHED BLACK SHOES
...turn a corner, and walk purposefully.
Three liveried FOOTMEN carrying newspapers, tea, etc. They
head through corridors of the palace.
They reach a door. Knock gently. Unsure what to do, they
enter.

34

21.

35

INT. DRAWING-ROOM - DAY

35

The same (darkened) drawing-room as the night before. The
KING is fast asleep in a chair. Curtains are drawn.
The FOOTMEN tiptoe to the curtains, and open them. Light
floods in. The KING slowly wakes.
KING GEORGE
What time is it?
FOOTMAN
Eight thirty, Sir.
KING GEORGE
I must have fallen asleep.
The wireless still plays in the corner of the room.
KING GEORGE
And?
VALET
And what, Sir?
KING GEORGE
Who won???
The FOOTMAN presents the KING with the newspapers, (WE DON”T
SEE THEM).
The KING looks at the papers, then his face breaks out in a
smile. Visibly relieved.
KING GEORGE
Oh, thank goodness!
On the wireless: we hear that the newly (re)elected Prime
Minister is arriving at his constituency.
KING GEORGE
What’s wrong with you, man? Smile!
The FOOTMAN stops and stares in horror. Another mouse is
scurrying across the floor.
It scurries right past the KING himself.
36

EXT. WOODFORD TOWN HALL - DAY

36

CHURCHILL stands on the steps of the town hall, in his home
constituency; CLEMMIE by his side.
He is surrounded by TV and FILM cameras. A CROWD of people
has turned up to hear him speak.

22.

WINSTON
A hard task lies before us. Fifty
million people are now crowded in our
small island which produces food for
only three-fifths of them, and has to
earn the rest from over the seas by
exporting manufactures for which we
must also first import the raw
material. No community of such a size,
and standing at so high a level of
civilisation, has ever been
economically so precariously poised.
An ever larger and more formidable
world is growing up around us. The
realities which confront us are
numerous, adverse and stubborn. For
the last two years our island has been
distracted by party strife and
electioneering. What the nation needs
is several years of quiet, steady
administration. I thank the returning
office and all who have assisted, for
the faithful and cheerful and
efficient way in which they have
discharged their duties, and I wish
you all - whatever party you belong good fortune for yourselves and for
our Island Home.
CHURCHILL ends the speech by saying...
WINSTON
And now, if you’ll excuse me, I must
go to Buckingham Palace to ask the
King’s permission to form a
government.
Cheers. CHURCHILL goes through the crowd, being congratulated
and clapped. He gets into his car.
37

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
A FOOTMAN is on the phone. Listens. Nods.
FOOTMAN
When can we expect him?
(listens)
Right you are.
He looks up at the MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD...
FOOTMAN
On his way. Ten minutes.
Another FOOTMAN nods.

The MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD walks through corridors.
MASTER OF HOUSEHOLD
Five minutes.
39

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

39

The MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD’s office.
FOOTMAN
He’s pulling in now.
The MASTER of THE HOUSEHOLD hangs up the phone, gets to his
feet. Shoots his cuffs. This is important.
MASTER OF HOUSEHOLD
Right.
40

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

40

A black car sweeps through the North-centre gate, through the
North side arch and into the inner quadrangle.
The car comes to a standstill. The door opens.
A pair of black boots get out and walk to the rear of the
car.
The trunk opens and a large black bag is pulled out.
The MASTER of the HOUSEHOLD and two liveried FOOTMEN appear
in a doorway.
MASTER OF HOUSEHOLD
Are we happy to see YOU, Sir!
VERMIN CATCHER
People generally are. Until they get
the bill.
MASTER OF HOUSEHOLD
This way. Something of an infestation.
The MAN is led into the palace. We PULL BACK to reveal his
car on which is written...VERMIN SOLUTIONS.
As they disappear inside, another CAR sweeps into the
quadrangle.
It reaches another door, where the King’s EQUERRY, a handsome
RAF officer aged 37, (Group Capt PETER TOWNSEND), in military
uniform is waiting.
Car doors open, and CLEMENT ATTLEE gets out.

24.

TOWNSEND
Mr. Attlee.
ATTLEE
(correcting)
Prime Minister, to you, Captain
Townsend. My resignation has not yet
been accepted.
ATTLEE brushes past TOWNSEND.
TOWNSEND
Forgive me, Sir.
(corrects himself)
Prime Minister.
TOWNSEND closes his eyes, “Damn”, then follows.

EXT. 28 HYDE PARK GATE - CHURCHILL RESIDENCE - DAY

41

CHURCHILL returns to Hyde Park Square.
42

INT. 28 HYDE PARK GATE - CHURCHILL RESIDENCE - DAY

42

CHURCHILL walks into his house to be told by a servant.
SERVANT
Mr. Eden is here for you?
WINSTON
What? Now?
SERVANT
He said it was important.
WINSTON
I have to get changed. Put my morning
coat out, will you?
43

INT. 28 HYDE PARK GATE - CHURCHILL RESIDENCE

- DAY

EDEN skulks dangerously in the library. His face cast on
shadows. CHURCHILL enters.
WINSTON
Anthony, it’s not a good time...
EDEN
What will you give me?
WINSTON
What?

43

25.

EDEN
If I’m to be denied the leadership I
deserve, that people want, I want to
know what compensation I will receive.
WINSTON
I am not yet P.M.
EDEN
I demand to know.
WINSTON
Foreign Office.
EDEN
It’s not enough.
WINSTON
It’s the jewel in the Crown.
EDEN
No, Winston.
(pointed)
You have that.
WINSTON
Then what? I can’t give you the
Exchequer, too.
EDEN
Deputy PM.
WINSTON
Why?
EDEN
It’s the only office that sends out a
clear enough signal...
WINSTON
The King won’t accept it. It’s
unconstitutional.
EDEN
...that I will be your successor...
WINSTON
I have not yet got my feet under the
desk. I have not yet been asked by our
King to form a government. And you are
already talking about succeeding me?
EDEN
I would remind you this a conversation
which should not be happening. You
should not be there at all.

26.

WINSTON
I just won us an election.
EDEN
Labour just LOST us an election. It
should have been a landslide in our
favour. Thanks to you, it was close.
CHURCHILL stares at EDEN.
WINSTON
I’ve never seen you like this before.
I thought you above it. Had I known
you’d have such pusillanimity in you,
I’d never have groomed you the way I
have.
EDEN
Groom me in order to humiliate me.
Let’s be clear. The situation between
us has changed. You need ME more than
I need YOU now.
CHURCHILL looks at him. There is open hostility in EDEN’s
face.
WINSTON
You’re tired, Anthony. Go home, get
some sleep, then, if I may be so
presumptuous as to offer some advice.
Take a moment to enjoy our victory. We
WON.
(a beat)
Now, if you don’t mind, I must to go
to the Palace.
CHURCHILL turns, and walks out.
44

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

44

The VERMIN CATCHER is examining tiny marks on the floor.
VERMIN CATCHER
Mmm hmmm.
He makes notes in a note pad.
45

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
He walks along another corridor...
VERMIN CATCHER
I see.
He makes more notes.

27.

46

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

On hands and knees now, in nooks and crannies...
VERMIN CATCHER
Mm hmmm.
He scribbles more notes.
47

INT. MASTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD’S OFFICE - DAY

47

The VERMIN CATCHER presents his findings..
VERMIN CATCHER
You don’t just have mice. You have an
infestation of mice. You also have
cockroaches, silverfish and moths.
Worse...
The VERMIN CATCHER indicates they follow.
The palace staff look at one another, then get to their feet.
48

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
The VERMIN CATCHER leads them down a corridor. Then stops.
VERMIN CATCHER
There.
He gets to his knees. Indicates something in the corner.
VERMIN CATCHER
Droppings. Curtulous Magna.
MASTER OF HOUSEHOLD
What does that mean?
VERMIN CATCHER
Rats.
The MASTER of the HOUSEHOLD’s eyes open in horror, then he
leaps aside, as...
Doors open and ATTLEE emerges from the Audience Room,
accompanied by the King’s EQUERRY, (TOWNSEND).
MASTER OF HOUSEHOLD
Prime Minister.
ATTLEE rolls his eyes, and walks past.
ATTLEE
Not any more. Mr. Attlee to you.

48

28.

49

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

49

ATTLEE leaves the Palace, takes a last look, then gets into
his car.
As ATTLEE’s car sweeps out, CHURCHILL’s car sweeps into the
palace, and pulls up beside the VERMIN CATCHER’S car.
TOWNSEND
Prime Minister. Congratulations.
WINSTON
Not yet, Peter. His Majesty has not
asked me to form a government yet.
It’s Mr. Churchill.
TOWNSEND stares. Thrown.
CHURCHILL walks past him, and into the palace.
50

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

50

TOWNSEND follows CHURCHILL inside. They face the stairs.
TOWNSEND
Will you be all right up the stairs,
Sir?
WINSTON
Do I have a choice?
TOWNSEND
Afraid not.
WINSTON
Then why in God’s name ask the
question? My brain is flooded now with
tantalising mirages of lifts, hoists,
elevators, winches, escalators....
CHURCHILL begins the arduous process of climbing the stairs.
51

INT. PRIVATE AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY

51

KING GEORGE is in the Audience Room making final checks among
the drinks. He moves slowly, clearly frustrated by his
increasing frailty. He breathes heavily - easily exhausted.
KING GEORGE
(indicating drinks
cabinet)
Better top up the whisky and soda.
Just in case.
(checking desk)
Notepad and pen in the usual place?

29.

VALET
Yes, Sir.
Another VALET arrives with a large chair.
KING GEORGE
What’s that?
VALET
An armchair, Sir. We just thought, a
man of his age, it might be more
comfortable for him.
KING GEORGE
You’re new, aren’t you? And obviously
not well briefed. This one doesn’t
sit.
A knock on the door. The EQUERRY enters.
EQUERRY
Mr. Churchill, Sir.
KING GEORGE
Go on, scram. And take that awful
thing with you.
The VALETS disappear through the other door, with the ugly
armchair.
KING GEORGE turns to face his EQUERRY.
KING GEORGE
Show him in, Peter.
TOWNSEND goes, as CHURCHILL appears in the doorway.
WINSTON
Your Majesty.
KING GEORGE
Prime Minister.
WINSTON
Not yet, Sir.
CHURCHILL lowers himself to one knee with difficulty.
KING GEORGE
Come, Mr. Churchill..
CHURCHILL reaches the final position of supplicancy.
KING GEORGE
Very well. The people have spoken,
your party has won the election, and
as their Sovereign I invite you to
form a Government in my name.

30.

WINSTON
An honour I gratefully accept.
CHURCHILL takes the KING’s hand and lowers his head in a
“kissing” gesture of fealty and allegiance.
KING GEORGE
Now please, rise.
WINSTON
I’ll do my best.
CHURCHILL rises with difficulty.
KING GEORGE
A close one.
WINSTON
Very.
KING GEORGE
Did you get any sleep?
WINSTON
A couple of hours.
KING GEORGE
And? When it became clear? Be honest
with me. Your reaction?
WINSTON
I wept, Sir.
(allows himself a smile)
Incontinently.
KING GEORGE
As, I believe, did your predecessor.
WINSTON
Yes. Mr. Attlee will be hurting. But
feeling just a fraction of what I felt
in 1945.
KING GEORGE
I’m sure.
WINSTON
And how wrong those predictions were.
How false those dawns? How delinquent
those promises. That Labour should be
able to manage the economy. They could
barely manage themselves.
KING GEORGE
Yes.
WINSTON
And they were too old. Far too old.

31.

KING GEORGE
Quite. The country needs youth.
WINSTON
Yes.
KING GEORGE
Anyway, congratulations.
WINSTON
And you, Sir.
KING GEORGE
Whatever for?
WINSTON
Your rapid recovery, Sir.
CHURCHILL smiles - putting on a brave face, but clearly
concerned for his friend.
KING GEORGE
Oh, thank you.
The KING lights a cigarette, unable to stop.
KING GEORGE
Everyone’s rather thrilled. I seem to
have bounced back quicker than anyone
thought. I wasn’t sure what I imagined
breathing through one lung would feel
like.
(exhales smoke)
Turns out there’s barely any
difference.
(putting on a brave face)
Though probably still wise to let the
Edinburghs do the Australia trip. What
say you?
WINSTON
Yes. Will she be prepared?
KING GEORGE
Who?
WINSTON
Princess Elizabeth?
KING GEORGE
Oh, yes. Safe pair of hands, that one.
The right girl was born first, if you
know what I mean. Or maybe it’s
because she was born first.
KING GEORGE notices CHURCHILL flinching..

32.

KING GEORGE
Are you sure you’re all right, Prime
Minister? You won’t sit down?
WINSTON
Perfectly.
KING GEORGE
So tell me. What might I look forward
to in the King’s speech? And who will
feature in your Cabinet?
WINSTON
Jock Colville will be coming back as
Private Secretary.
KING GEORGE
Oh, good.
WINSTON
I’ll bring Lord Alexander back from
Ottawa to be Minister of Defence, Pug
Ismay, and Eden, of course. He’ll be
Foreign Secretary. Lots of familiar
faces. In essence it’s the old team
from the war days.
KING GEORGE
But we’re not AT war, Prime Minister.
WINSTON
Oh, I beg to differ. The threats
facing this country have never been
greater. Everything we fought for is
in danger of being for nothing. If
peace among the Germans and French is
not consolidated. If economies fail.
If the Russians are not contained.
A flicker behind the KING’s eyes. He is concerned.
KING GEORGE
You’ve been a great hero to me. To
this country. We all owe you so very
much. But time stops for no man. We
must all know when it is time to let
the next generation take over.
WINSTON
I am fine, your Majesty. The country
has elected me to do a job. I intend
to do it.
KING GEORGE
(unconvinced)
Very well.

33.

WINSTON
Your Majesty.
KING GEORGE
Prime Minister.
CHURCHILL bows deeply, and goes.
52

EXT. DOWNING STREET - DAY

52

CHURCHILL arrives at Downing Street with CLEMMIE. They pose
for photographs.
Then turn, and enter the building.
53

INT. DOWNING STREET - DAY

53

CHURCHILL enters to be greeted by the entire Downing Street
staff. Lined up to greet him.
SECRETARIES, CIVIL SERVANTS, TELEPHONE OPERATORS, MAIDS, etc.
They applaud.
CHURCHILL shakes hands, greeting familiar faces.
CHURCHILL
Thank you, thank you! How are you! And
how’s the little one? Not so little I
expect! A bearded giant by now!
CHURCHILL spots something in a corridor, and stops...
WINSTON
Oh, dear. Chair in the corner? No, no,
back by the window, please.
He passes a ticker-tape machine, which rattles away outside
the Private Secretary’s office, keeping everyone in touch
with the outside world, hammering out the latest news.
WINSTON
And let’s have this upstairs again.
PRIVATE SECRETARY
Everything as it was before?
WINSTON
Yes. Exactly as it was before.
CHURCHILL reaches the end of the corridor, and enters..

34.

54

54

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

Unchanged since 1796, three brass chandeliers, two Corinthian
columns, the single portrait of Robert Walpole, the first
Prime Minister..
CHURCHILL stands in the doorway, surveys the eerily silent,
empty room. A vast table, 20 Adam style chairs.
FLASHCUT TO:
55

55

CHURCHILL’S IMAGINATION

As Cabinet ministers from the previous administration push
past and jostle him into the room, taking their seats, middiscussion.
CRIPPS, BEVAN, ATTLEE, MORRISON, BEVIN, HALL, GREENWOOD,
SHINWELL, LAWSON, etc. Air thick with argument and smoke.
CUT TO:
56

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

56

CHURCHILL snaps out of his reveries. Sees the empty room. His
lips curl with distaste.
WINSTON
Drenched in socialism.
He turns, and walks out.
57

INT. DOWNING STREET FLAT - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

57

The door opens, and CLEMMIE enters, being shown round by an
AIDE..
CLEMMIE
And I hoped I’d seen the back of this
place. Do you suppose I am the only
person that’s ever said that on their
first day?
The AIDE smiles politely.
CLEMMIE
I will take the Drawing Room
downstairs as my private study, and
the room next to it, overlooking St.
James’s Park, as my bedroom. I think
this time my husband should stay up
here on the second floor.
AIDE
By the lift?

35.

CLEMMIE
Yes.
The AIDE and CLEMMIE exchange a look, then go.
58

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY

ELIZABETH walks along a corridor. She comes to a door, and
stops. She knocks.
KING GEORGE (V.O.)
Come!
59

INT. KING’S BEDROOM - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

59

ELIZABETH walks into the bedroom.
KING GEORGE
Dear girl, there you are! Welcome
back!
She goes over to her father, kisses him. ELIZABETH notices a
filled ash-tray by the bedside.
KING GEORGE
I’m sorry, I’d so wanted to greet you
properly in the Audience Room.
ELIZABETH
Whatever for?
KING GEORGE
An audience! You returned from
official business, I wanted to pay you
that respect. But then my cough kept
me up all night.
ELIZABETH
I’m sorry..
KING GEORGE
How was it? It wasn’t too tiring? All
those provincial Canadian mayors? And
their wives? They didn’t exhaust you
with their tittle tattle?
ELIZABETH
I think I’ve perhaps seen enough
rodeos for a while.
KING GEORGE
And the mood? If one were to scratch
the surface? All very friendly?
ELIZABETH
How do you mean?

36.

KING GEORGE
No sign of them having had enough?
Wanting to break away?
ELIZABETH
No - all the indications were that the
ties are stronger than ever. That
certainly seemed to be what the
Canadian press was saying.
KING GEORGE
Ah, that’s the effect you have on
them!
ELIZABETH
I doubt that. Now how are you?
KING GEORGE
I’m fine. Bouncing back.
ELIZABETH notices the filled ash-trays by the bedside.
KING GEORGE
But I’ve not bounced back quite enough
to travel again. Not yet, anyway.
Which brings me to my next point..
60

INT. CLARENCE HOUSE - NIGHT

60

ELIZABETH and PHILIP are in their bedroom, getting undressed
and ready for bed..
PHILIP
Ceylon?
ELIZABETH
Then onto Australia.
PHILIP
Oh, God.
ELIZABETH
And New Zealand.
PHILIP
We’ll be gone months.
ELIZABETH
They think about three.
PHILIP
On the Royal Yacht? It’ll never be
done in three.
ELIZABETH
All right, four.

37.

PHILIP
It’s five, at least.
ELIZABETH
(she can’t lie to him)
Probably. Yes.
PHILIP
And what for?
ELIZABETH
“To bind the Commonwealth and let
people connect with their royal
family.”
PHILIP
The Commonwealth.
ELIZABETH
Yes. The Commonwealth.
PHILIP shoots a frustrated look.
PHILIP
And what am I supposed to do all that
time?
ELIZABETH
You won’t be bored. Don’t worry we’ll
put you to work.
PHILIP
My work is as a naval officer. Not
grinning like an idiot while you cut
ribbons.
(a silence)
What about the children?
ELIZABETH
They’ll be fine here.
PHILIP
For five MONTHS?
ELIZABETH
We can’t take them.
A beat.
ELIZABETH
Don’t make this harder for me. You
knew this would happen.
PHILIP
Eventually, yes. One day.
PHILIP looks troubled.

38.

PHILIP
Not so soon.
61

INT. DOWNING STREET - DAY

61

A working day at Downing Street.
62

INT. SECRETARY’S OFFICE - DAY

62

A busy secretarial pool. Half a dozen female secretaries
typing away. Churchill’s private secretary (COLVILLE)
arrives, and addresses the ladies..
COLVILLE
He’s awake now. Wants to see someone.
Several SECRETARIES show willing..
COLVILLE
He’s in the bath.
The older (higher ranking) SECRETARIES sit down again.
All heads turn to face a young SECRETARY. Clearly the junior.
The JUNIOR SECRETARY gulps.
63

INT. DOWNING STREET - BATHROOM - DAY

63

The sound of splashing from behind a door. The SECRETARY
nervously takes her seat outside the bathroom.
SECRETARY
I’m here, Sir.
WINSTON
And your name?
SECRETARY
Venetia, Sir.
64

INT. DOWNING STREET - BATHROOM - SAME TIME

64

CHURCHILL sits in the bath. Reading tray. Newspapers. Whisky.
Cigar. Paraphernalia.
WINSTON
How old are you Venetia?
SECRETARY
Twenty-two, Sir.

39.

WINSTON
Many things can be said about me, but
even my worst detractors would say I’m
as good as my word, and I give you my
word Venetia, I shall not emerge in a
state of nature without fair warning.
VENETIA’s face: imagining. The sound of splashing continues
from behind the door.
WINSTON
Have they told you terrible things
about me?
SECRETARY
Sir?
WINSTON
Your colleagues that have worked for
me before.
SECRETARY
It is said...you can be difficult.
WINSTON
Difficult?
SECRETARY
And demanding. And that your moods can
be hard to predict.
WINSTON
I can be a monster. Did they say that?
SECRETARY
Yes, Sir.
WINSTON
It’s true. But you need to be a
monster to defeat Hitler. Did Colville
give you my box?
SECRETARY
He did, Sir.
WINSTON
What’s in it?
The SECRETARY looks down at the locked red box.
SECRETARY
You’d like me to open it?
WINSTON
Unless you have x-ray vision, you will
need to open it so that you might tell
me what’s in it.

40.

The SECRETARY opens it with trembling hands. Inside are all
the PM’s papers.
SECRETARY
Some papers about rationing.
WINSTON
What else?
SECRETARY
Some papers from the Exchequer.
WINSTON
Anything from the Foreign Office?
About America and Russia?
SECRETARY
No, Sir.
WINSTON
Very well. Then start with the
Exchequor. Read it aloud. Don’t be
alarmed if you hear no response. I
will be making mental notes.
The SECRETARY clears her throat, and starts reading.
SECRETARY
“The economic situation we have
inherited is worse than 1949, and in
many ways worse than even 1947.
Confidence in sterling is impaired. In
the present half-year, we are running
into an external deficit at the rate
of £700 million a year compared with
an annual rate of surplus of about
£350 million in the same period a year
ago...”
In the bathroom, CHURCHILL nods off.
65

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
The Cabinet is assembled. The CHANCELLOR (RAB BUTLER, who
speaks with a pronounced impediment) is bwiefing everyone.
CHANCELLOR
...that means a detewiowation of more
than £1,000 million a year.
(MORE)

65

41.
CHANCELLOR (cont'd)
Latest estimates show that in 1952, on
pwesent trends and policies and
without making any allowance for
further speculative losses, the United
Kingdom would have a deficit on its
genewal balance of overseas payments
of between £500 million and £600
million, and the loss to the centwal
gold and dollar weserves in the
twansactions of the sterling aweas as
a whole with the west of the world
might be appweciably more. Given these
circumstances, I’d be intewested to
hear the PM’s view wegarding the
pwospects for wecovewy...

Cabinet heads turn. All eyes on CHURCHILL, who stares.
Suddenly looking old and frail and lost.
CHURCHILL
In the war I knew what to do. Since
coming into power, I’ve been
confronted with a range of issues,
particularly economic, that are
infinitely complicated, and quite
beyond me. I don't know, I can't see
my way into these things at the
moment...I expect I shall find it but
at this moment, this morning, I really
don’t have an answer for you. We’ll
think about all this next time we
meet...
CHURCHILL gets up, with difficulty and walks out. Everyone
gets to their feet out of respect..
But after CHURCHILL has gone, the room is filled with
anything BUT respect.
SALISBURY’s eyes meet EDEN’s. And MACMILLAN’s.
66

INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS - DAY

66

EDEN walks through the corridors of House of Commons. He
reaches an office, looks right and left, then knocks...
67

INT. SALISBURY’S OFFICE - HOUSE OF COMMONS - DAY

67

Inside: LORD SALISBURY, MACMILLAN, HALIFAX, and three or four
other plotters.
SALISBURY
Either we get rid of him now - or we
lose the next election and quite
possibly lose power for a generation.
(MORE)

42.
SALISBURY (cont'd)
This is your time, Anthony. The party
is for you. The country needs you.

EDEN
What should I do? He’s party leader. I
can’t push him out.
SALISBURY
You must go and see the one person who
can.
EDEN’s face.
SALISBURY
Albert Windsor.
EDEN
You mean the King?
SALISBURY
No, I mean Albert Windsor. The King of
England would never dream of telling
his Prime Minister to stand down. It
would violate every part of the
constitution. But...
EDEN
But...?
SALISBURY
Albert Windsor might advise a friend
to stand down.
EDEN
I see.
68

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

68

The King’s EQUERRY - Peter TOWNSEND walks along a corridor.
He turns a corner, then reaches a door. He knocks.
TOWNSEND
You asked to see me?
69

INT. PRIVATE SECRETARY’S OFFICE - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 69
The King’s Private secretary, (TOMMMY LASCELLES) is inside,
GCB, GCVO, CMG, MC. Military. Aristocratic.
A formidable figure. Intimidating. Conservative
PRIVATE SECRETARY
Ah, Peter. Thanks for coming. The
Foreign Secretary has requested an
audience with the King this afternoon.
(MORE)

43.
PRIVATE SECRETARY (cont'd)
Something about a diplomatic reception
for the Head of the NATO Committee,
although I fail to see what’s quite so
urgent about that. Anyhow, I thought
we could squeeze it in at three.

TOWNSEND
That’s generally when His Majesty
takes his walk.
PRIVATE SECRETARY
I realise that, but hoped we might
combine the two. Think you could make
that work?
TOWNSEND
Yes, Sir. I’m sure.
70

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

70

TOWNSEND walks through a corridor, on his way to see the
King, and passes a drawing room, where the door is open, and
a dog comes out.
TOWNSEND tuts, and ushers the dog back inside, is about to
close the door, when he straightens...
TOWNSEND
I’m so sorry.
71

INT. DRAWING-ROOM - DAY
PRINCESS MARGARET with her mother, the QUEEN, and with
ELIZABETH.
QUEEN MOTHER
Not at all. Come in, Peter. We were
just discussing where to have Xmas.
Tell me, do you think the King would
be well enough to go to Sandringham?
TOWNSEND
I do. As a matter of fact, I think it
would do him the world of good.
QUEEN MOTHER
I do, too. So it’s decided. Will you
join us?
MARGARET looks up.
TOWNSEND
Me?

71

44.

QUEEN MOTHER
Of course not. You will be spending it
with your family.
TOWNSEND
That was the plan. But what would his
Majesty’s preference be, do you
imagine?
QUEEN MOTHER
The King? Given the choice he’d never
let you out of his sight, you know
that. He’s quite devoted to you.
TOWNSEND
Then he can count on me at Christmas,
too.
QUEEN MOTHER
But what about your wife?
TOWNSEND
Oh, she’ll understand.
TOWNSEND’s eyes meet MARGARET’s for a moment. A moment longer
than is necessary, then goes.
This is spotted by ELIZABETH.
72

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
A car pulls up. EDEN gets out. He is greeted by the King’s
Equerry, TOWNSEND..
TOWNSEND
Afternoon, Sir.
EDEN
Peter.
TOWNSEND
In order to squeeze this meeting in,
his Majesty wondered if you’d mind
accompanying him on his afternoon
walk.
EDEN
Not at all.
TOWNSEND
That’s very kind, Sir. Still a little
wet underfoot, I’m afraid, after the
rain this morning.
EDEN
Don’t worry about that.

72

45.

TOWNSEND
We can provide some Galoshes.
EDEN
Really no need...
TOWNSEND
What size are you?
EDEN
Nine and a half. Though my riding
boots are a ten. And my Trench boots
were an 11. Make of that what you
will.
EDEN and TOWNSEND continue talking, and disappear into the
Palace.
73

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
ELIZABETH joins MARGARET in Margaret’s apartments on the
second floor of the palace.
ELIZABETH
I saw it.
MARGARET
What?
ELIZABETH
The look between the two of you.
(a beat)
It’s Peter.
Silence.
MARGARET
Nothing’s happened.
ELIZABETH
On the contrary. I’d say a great deal
has happened. You’ve fallen for him.
MARGARET
We’ve fallen for each other.
ELIZABETH
He feels the same way?
MARGARET
You must tell no one. The papers all
think I’m for Johnny Dalkeith or Billy
Wallace.
ELIZABETH
Mummy and Papa, too, by the way.

73

46.

MARGARET
But they’re just...boys. Whereas Peter
is...
ELIZABETH
I can quite see the attraction of
Peter. He was a hero in the war. But
he has a wife.
MARGARET
He doesn’t love her.
ELIZABETH
You only have his word for that.
MARGARET averts her eyes.
ELIZABETH
He has children, too.
MARGARET
He could still be a good father to
them. I’d never stand in his way.
ELIZABETH
You’ve already discussed it?
MARGARET
We have.
ELIZABETH
Oh, Margaret.
MARGARET
Just be happy for me? Can you?
(takes ELIZABETH’s hand)
I nearly squealed with happiness when
he agreed to come for Christmas.
ELIZABETH
A squeal? That would have been most
unbecoming.
MARGARET
Couldn’t help myself.
MARGARET stops in her tracks and squeals.
MARGARET
Eeeeeeeekkkkk!!!
ELIZABETH
Yes, all right. No need to prove a
point.
MARGARET
Eeeeeeeekkkkkk!!!

47.

MARGARET points. ELIZABETH stops and stares. There, lying in
the corner of the room, is a dead RAT.

EXT. GARDENS - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

74

Two pairs of galoshes squelch through the damp grass of
Buckingham Palace gardens..
EDEN
Most of this is just a function of
age. And none of us can be blamed for
growing old. But it means he struggles
with his memory, and learning the
names of new faces, new ideas, new
concepts. He has little or no interest
in Home Affairs, focusing almost
entirely on issues relating to America
and Russia, where quite frankly we are
no longer players. He refuses to
acknowledge that. And so important
domestic matters like reducing
rationing, tackling the economy,
etcetera, are falling behind.
KING GEORGE
(hoarsely again)
What do you suggest I do?
The King stops - COUGHS loudly. The cough is back again. A
harbinger of yet another inevitable operation on the horizon.
EDEN
As Sovereign, of course, there is
nothing you CAN do, from a
Constitutional standpoint. But as
friend, as Albert Windsor? You are the
one person I can think of to whom he
might listen.
KING GEORGE
But that is where we run into
difficulties. You make the assumption
that for me to alternate between the
two is a simple matter, like flicking
a switch. I no longer AM Albert
Windsor. That person, of whom I had
grown rather fond in the forty-one
years I knew him, was murdered on the
11th December 1936 by his elder
brother. You’re right, Albert Windsor
would dearly have liked to say
something to his friend, Winston
Churchill and tell him to take a step
back. Put his feet up. Let a younger
generation take over and run the
country. But he is no longer with us.
(MORE)

48.
KING GEORGE (cont'd)
That void has been filled by George
VI, who turns out to be an officious
individual - and a stickler for the
rules, and who would no more allow the
Sovereign to advise the Prime Minister
than stand for office himself.

EDEN
Even when it’s in the national
interest?
KING GEORGE
The national interest? Or Anthony
Eden’s interest?
EDEN
Sir?
KING GEORGE
I am aware you harassed Mr. Churchill
for the office of Deputy PM. But don’t
you see in doing so you were robbing
ME of my privilege of consent? The
rules state quite clearly that in the
event of a resignation of a
Conservative Party Leader it is the
Sovereign that chooses his successor.
When my Private Secretary told me you
wanted to see me today, the reason I
agreed to the audience was to not to
hear your grievances about Mr.
Churchill, rather to communicate mine
about YOU.
EDEN
Sir.
KING GEORGE
The P.M will step down in time. And
until then, if I may offer some
advice.
EDEN
Please.
KING GEORGE
It’s better to be patient and get what
you desire in the right time, than
have high office thrust upon you when
you least expect or want it.
GEORGE VI’s haunted eyes. His frail health. Ravaged by the
responsibilities of an unwanted Crown.
KING GEORGE

Your Majesty.
The two MEN shake hands, then head in different directions.
Galoshes squelching in the mud.

EXT/INT. DOWNING STREET - NIGHT
CHURCHILL and CLEMMIE sit alone over dinner.
CLEMMIE
I know one should never believe what
one hears, particularly in this place.
WINSTON
But?
CLEMMIE
I heard a rumour Anthony went to see
the King yesterday. To express his
concern. About your age. Your
leadership. Your incapacity.
(a beat)
And to ask him to bid you stand down.
WINSTON
Utter nonsense. Who told you that?
CLEMMIE
I can tell you who told me. Jock
Colville’s wife.
WINSTON
Mary?
CLEMMIE
Margaret. But not who told her. Or who
told them. Or who told the people that
told THEM.
WINSTON
The King would never engage in that
kind of treachery. He’s a stickler for
process and procedure.
CLEMMIE
Fine. Ignore me.
WINSTON
If you don’t mind I will.
CLEMMIE
The meeting probably never took place.
You have nothing to worry about. Don’t
start to brood, will you?

75

50.

WINSTON
Brood? About what? Certainly not.
76

INT. DOWNING STREET - STUDY - DAY

76

CHURCHILL is in his study. Brooding. A knock at the door. The
door opens and the SECRETARY pops her head round..
SECRETARY
Half hour warning, Sir.
WINSTON
For what?
SECRETARY
Your weekly audience with the King.
WINSTON
Really? I thought he’d had another
bronchoscopy.
SECRETARY
He did.
WINSTON
And? He was frail before, must be even
frailer now. He’s not convalescing?
SECRETARY
No, Sir. He resumed his constitutional
duties on the 10th.
WINSTON
(disappointed/brooding)
I see.
VENETIA turns, is about to go, when...
WINSTON
Tell me, Venetia. You have good
connections at the palace? With your
opposite number?
SECRETARY
Yes, Sir.
WINSTON
Can you establish, without drawing
attention to the reason for the
question, whether His Majesty has had
an audience with the Foreign secretary
recently.
SECRETARY
I can try.

51.

WINSTON
Quick as you can?
77

INT. DOWNING STREET - DAY

77

The SECRETARY moves urgently up the grand staircase, and
knocks on the door again.
78

INT. DOWNING STREET - STUDY - DAY

78

The SECRETARY enters.
SECRETARY
The answer’s yes. The King met with
Mr. Eden eight days ago.
WINSTON
Really?
SECRETARY
They went for a walk together in the
palace grounds.
WINSTON
I see.
CHURCHILL’s face:
WINSTON
I find I’m no longer feeling my best
this afternoon, Venetia. Will you make
my excuses, beg the King’s
forgiveness?
SECRETARY
Sir?
WINSTON
I shan’t be attending the Audience.
79

INT. DOWNING STREET - DAY

79

A week later. CHURCHILL is in the bath. The SECRETARY speaks
through the door...
SECRETARY
The car is waiting, Sir.
WINSTON
What for?
SECRETARY
The weekly audience. We missed it last
week, if you remember?

52.

WINSTON
Yes. But by a stroke of misfortune, I
find I have an intolerable migraine.
SECRETARY
Oh.
The SECRETARY looks thrown.
SECRETARY
Might I say something else?
WINSTON
Why?
SECRETARY
I said migraine last week.
WINSTON
Fine. Pick any affliction you like. It
will certainly be applicable. There
isn’t an organ left in this body that
is functioning as it should.
OVER THIS: the sound of the KING’s voice..
KING GEORGE (ON RADIO)
As I speak to you today, I wish you,
wherever you may be, a happy
Christmas.
80

INT. CHEQUERS - DAY

CHURCHILL and CLEMMIE (and members of their extended family)
are listening to the King’s speech on the wireless.
KING GEORGE (ON RADIO)
Though we live in hard and difficult
times, Christmas is, and always will
be, a time when we can count our
blessings.
Christmas decorations everywhere. A tree in the corner.
CLEMMIE
His voice sounds better. Stronger. And
his health must have improved, if they
allowed him to go to Sandringham.
(a beat)
When was the last time you saw him?
WINSTON
Weeks ago. It’s been a masterpiece of
survival, dodging the bullet.
(MORE)

53.
WINSTON (cont'd)
Six weeks on the trot I’ve found a
different ailment that’s kept me from
attending the private audience with
the King. And next week I sail to
America, so that’s another three weeks
there..

KING GEORGE (ON RADIO)
I myself have every cause for deep
thankfulness. For not only, by the
Grace of God, and through faithful
skill of my doctors, surgeons and
nurses have I come through my illness.
And I have learned once again that it
is in bad times that we value most
highly the support and sympathy of our
friends.
WINSTON
(chuckles to himself)
It must be torture for Anthony.

He finishes dressing and takes a look at himself in the
mirror.

Elevator doors open and CHURCHILL emerges to see his
surprised-looking SECRETARY. He raises his hands..
WINSTON
I know. I’m late.
SECRETARY
Sir?

83

54.

WINSTON
But I will go willingly. “When these
graven lines you see, Traveller, do
not pity me; Though I be among the
dead, Let no mournful word be said.”
Is the car outside?
SECRETARY
What for?
WINSTON
The private Audience with the King.
(shrugs)
Even I accept I can’t put it off any
longer.
SECRETARY
There is no Audience today.
WINSTON
What?
(looks confused)
It’s not Tuesday?
SECRETARY
It is, Sir. But the Palace let us know
some time ago the King was going to be
there in person to see off Princess
Elizabeth.
WINSTON
Of course. The Edinburghs are leaving
today.
WINSTON
So no Audience?
SECRETARY
No, Sir.
A smile spreads across CHURCHILL’s face.
WINSTON
“Praise the high gods, for in giving
This for man, and this alone,
They have made his chance for living
Shine the equal of their own.”

INT. PLANE - DAY

Inside, the plane has been modified, seats removed for a
table to be installed. ELIZABETH and PHILIP, along with the
rest of the party, (MIKE PARKER, Philip’s old ship-mate and
aide-de-camp, MARTIN CHARTERIS, Elizabeth’s Private
Secretary, several assistants and ladies in waiting).
All stand to say farewell to the KING and QUEEN and MARGARET.
KING GEORGE
Thank you for stepping into my shoes.
ELIZABETH
Thank you for trusting me.
KING GEORGE
I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to a
little jealousy. Where are you
starting? Kenya?
ELIZABETH
Yes. A few days holiday before the
hard work begins.
QUEEN MOTHER
How lovely. It’s still like the good
old days there.
KING GEORGE
Got everything you need? Gallons of
quinine?
PHILIP
Yes, Sir. Thank you.
KING GEORGE
And a good rifle?
PHILIP
All packed.
QUEEN MOTHER
Did we buy you some safari clothes?
PHILIP
Ma’am?
QUEEN MOTHER
I heard the last time you wore hand-medowns from your Uncle.
Voices fall silent. The atmosphere changes. PHILIP stares.
Unflinching.

56.

PHILIP
I managed to get to the tailor this
time.
KING GEORGE
Good for you.
QUEEN MOTHER
If not, you could always go native.
Join the Mau Mau.
PHILIP
(correcting)
Kikuya.
QUEEN MOTHER
What?
PHILIP
That’s the indigenous name of the
tribe. Mau Mau is an Anglicisation.
QUEEN MOTHER
Quite.
A moment’s awkwardness. Little love lost between these two.
KING GEORGE
Well, goodbye my dear.
The KING and QUEEN and MARGARET kiss ELIZABETH farewell,
making a fuss of her.
KING GEORGE
I’d say look after her, but this one’s
quite capable of looking after
herself. And the rest of us, too.
He heads to the door..
KING GEORGE
If you need me...I’m on the end of a
phone. Or just hit the jungle drums.
He looks at ELIZABETH. As if he knows he’s looking at her for
the last time.
KING GEORGE
You’ll enjoy Kandy. And the Hill
Stations. Always rather reminded me of
Surrey. See what you think.
And with that, the Royal party is gone.

Presently, the PAGE emerges from the bathroom...

And the reflection in the mirror; of a 26-year-old PRINCESS,
filming with a Super-8 camera.
ELIZABETH lowers the camera. Stares at herself for a brief
moment, in the reflection. The camera continues to whir...
It’s as if ELIZABETH senses something. A significance to the

WINSTON
Oh dear. This is bad news.

I’m afraid so.
WINSTON
How bad?
PRIVATE SECRETARY
“Hyde Park Corner.”
CHURCHILL’s face: devastated.

No. The worst. When?
PRIVATE SECRETARY
In the course of the night. Quite
peacefully, we believe.
CHURCHILL looks at his SECRETARY.
WINSTON
Call the Foreign Secretary.

What shall I say?
WINSTON
Tell him “Hyde Park Corner”. He’ll

BOBO MACDONALD, her dresser, steps forward..
BOBO
I’m so sorry, Ma’am.
ELIZABETH
What’s the matter?
CHARTERIS
It seems Ms. Macdonald neglected to
pack a black dress.
ELIZABETH
Can’t we improvise?
CHARTERIS
We’ve managed to locate a black
overcoat. On the royal yacht. That’s
being sent ahead to the airport.
ELIZABETH
Right.
CHARTERIS
We’ve also called ahead to London. A
hat will be brought onto the plane
before you disembark.
ELIZABETH
Thank you.
ELIZABETH looks at the packed bags, then at the journalists
and photographers waiting outside.

63.

ELIZABETH
Ready when you are.
CHARTERIS
A word of warning, Ma’am. A good many
journalists outside.
ELIZABETH
That was quick. Where have they all
crawled out from?
CHARTERIS
Royal correspondents mostly. They’ve
been arriving the last few days.
Assigned to cover the Tour.

ELIZABETH
Of course.

She turns, then gets into the car.
The car doors close. As the car moves off, one photographer,
deeply moved, puts his camera down in a gesture of respect.
One by one, his colleagues follow suit.

WINSTON
Messages of condolence to the Queen
and the two Princesses will be sent
from the Cabinet. At two-thirty today
I shall make a statement in the House
of Commons. No prayers. From there I
will go to St. James’s Palace where an
Accession Council meeting will be
held, to agree on the wording of the
proclamation, and to read a draft
proclamation of our new sovereign in
absentia. Princess Elizabeth is, I am
told, determined to fly home, and may
already...
(he checks his watch on a
chain)
...be en route. I think all of us
would be concerned by the prospect of
air travel - but a sea voyage could
take upwards of 14-days, and delaying
the funeral that long would be
unacceptable. We will simply have to
hope and pray for safe air passage.

QUEEN and PHILIP are in their private cabin on the plane. The
QUEEN stares out of the window..
PHILIP
You all right?
The QUEEN nods.
A knock at the door. The Private Secretary (Martin Charteris)
comes to tell the Queen..
CHARTERIS
We’ll be stopping in Entebbe shortly,
Ma’am. To refuel.
ELIZABETH
Right.
The PRIVATE SECRETARY hesitates, then...
CHARTERIS
May I also just say how very sorry I
am.

65.

ELIZABETH
Thank you. It did come a little sooner
than we all expected.
CHARTERIS
I mean that we will not be working
together any more.
The QUEEN looks shocked. PHILIP looks up.
ELIZABETH
Whyever not?
CHARTERIS
Because of your new rank, I will have
to give way to Mr. Lascelles. He is my
senior. That’s the way it’s done.
ELIZABETH
Oh, no. I’m so sorry.
CHARTERIS bows, then goes.
PHILIP
What a nightmare.
ELIZABETH
Why?
PHILIP
Charteris at least had one foot in the
real world. Tommy Lascelles? His
outlook on our monarchy and it’s place
in the world has more in common with
your grandfather. There goes any hope
of us modernising the institution.
ELIZABETH
Who said anything about modernising?
PHILIP
I did.
The QUEEN looks at PHILIP for a moment, then turns, and looks
out of the window again.

WINSTON (cont'd)
We cannot at this moment do more than
record a spontaneous expression of our
grief. The Accession Council will meet
at five o'clock this evening, and I
now ask you, Sir, to guide the House
as to our duties.

SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
I shall suspend the Sitting of the
House until 7 o'clock. When the House
resumes at that hour, I shall myself
take and subscribe the Oath, according
to law, and give an opportunity to
right honourable and honourable
Members to do the same.

Outside, flashes of lightening and rumbles of thunder.
CHARTERIS
There are storms closing in on the
airfield. They think it’ll be a couple
of hours before we can take off
again..
ELIZABETH
Right.
CHARTERIS
I asked them to bring us some water...
A person from the airport brings water...
PHILIP
I wouldn’t touch it.
CHARTERIS
And sandwiches.
PHILIP
Wouldn’t touch them, either.
ELIZABETH
I’ve no appetite anyway.
PHILIP
Stay here. I’ll see if I can find us
something that’s been boiled.

He had to come because a plane is
landing. Because the King died
somewhere.
ELIZABETH
Do you often come with him?
BOY
When he lets me. When I don’t have
school.
ELIZABETH
And you like going with him? Like
spending time with him? Alone?
BOY
Yes. Very much.
ELIZABETH
Why?
BOY
He teaches me things.

116

68.

ELIZABETH
Such as?
BOY
How to drive a car. He lets me sit on
his lap.
ELIZABETH
Yes, I did that. Oh, that’s very
exciting.
BOY
How to kill a fish after you catch it.
ELIZABETH
How?
BOY
Like this...
The BOY mimes a flapping fish being struck on the head.
ELIZABETH
What else?
BOY
How to be wise.
ELIZABETH
Oh?
(raised eyebrow)
I should like to know that. How is one
wise?
BOY
Be quiet. Say nothing at all.
ELIZABETH
Yes, that’s very wise. You’re very
lucky to have a father who gives you
advice like that. Will you please
thank him for coming in to do his job
on a night like this.
The BOY looks up to see a panicked PHILIP, the PRIVATE
SECRETARY (MARTIN CHARTERIS) a dozen uniformed SOLDIERS,
walking slowly towards them...
Relieved to have found their Queen safe and sound.
ELIZABETH
Don’t worry about them. They’re
harmless.
(a beat)
Most of them.
ELIZABETH gets to her feet, and goes.

INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS - DAY

117

In the house of Commons, CHURCHILL swears allegiance to the
new Queen, and signs the scroll..
WINSTON
I swear by Almighty God that I will be
faithful and bear true allegiance to
Her majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs
and successors, according to law. So
help me God.
118

INT. HOUSE OF LORDS - DAY

118

In the house of Lords, the Lords are in a line waiting, one
by one, to sign the oath of allegiance...
119

INT. SANDRINGHAM - DAY

119

TOWNSEND walks along a corridor. He knocks on the door.
VOICE
Come in.
TOWNSEND enters to see the forbidding figure of LASCELLES. In
his office. Sitting in shadows.
TOWNSEND
You asked to see me, Sir?
LASCELLES
Yes, come in.
120

INT. PRIVATE SECRETARY’S OFFICE - SANDRINGHAM - DAY
TOWNSEND closes the door. Apprehensive.
LASCELLES
Under normal circumstances following
the death of a member of the royal
family the equerry attending to the
deceased member returns to the
division of the armed forces from
which they were seconded and resumes
their career.
(indicates chair)
Do sit down.
TOWNSEND
Thank you, Sir.
TOWNSEND sits.

120

70.

LASCELLES
In your case I had assumed that
following the death of His late
Majesty, you would, at the earliest
appropriate moment, be resuming your
duties with the Royal Air Force.
TOWNSEND
Yes, Sir.
LASCELLES
I mentioned this to the Queen this
morning, who seemed very disappointed,
and she asked me, quite unusually, to
ask you whether you might like to
reconsider such a departure.
TOWNSEND
Sir?
LASCELLES
She felt that you had enjoyed an
uncommonly close understanding with
her late husband, and had earned not
just his trust, but the trust and
affection of the whole family.
TOWNSEND
Thank you, Sir.
LASCELLES
In the light of this, she wondered,
and I should make clear that I
strongly discouraged this in the room,
whether you might consider staying on
in a new role. As Comptroller of the
Queen’s Household.
TOWNSEND
I see.
LASCELLES
A kind, and generous offer, as befits
the widow of a kind and generous man.
But while I’m sure you’re greatly
flattered, I don’t expect you to
accept the post. Hence my
discouragement of the offer. I didn’t
want the Queen to suffer the
embarrassment of refusal.
TOWNSEND
Why would I not accept it?
LASCELLES
You’re asking the wrong question. Why
would you?

71.

TOWNSEND looks up.
LASCELLES
You’re a decorated war hero, still in
your prime. Comptroller of the Queen’s
Household has no military
associations. Doesn’t play to your
strengths. It would keep you away from
your wife, and family. Now’s the
natural time for a break. After all,
the person with whom you enjoyed the
“uncommonly close understanding” is
deceased.
TOWNSEND
I...er...
LASCELLES
Unless I am missing something. Unless
there is someone ELSE with whom you
enjoy an “uncommonly close
understanding” which would make
accepting the post more attractive.
TOWNSEND
I don’t know what you are referring
to.
LASCELLES
Don’t you, Group Captain Townsend?
Husband and father?
TOWNSEND
No, Sir.
LASCELLES
You are probably telling yourself that
because nothing has happened so far
that no one can know. Allow me to
disavow you of this delusion. Within
the close community of those serving
the family I regret to tell you, the
talk -- ugly talk, unbecoming talk,
tittle tattle -- is of little else.
LASCELLES looks at TOWNSEND.
LASCELLES
I’m aware of the toll that round-theclock service has on the private lives
of those that serve. I am also aware
of the feelings generated by continued
close proximity to the people you are
working for but I would hate you to
mistake those feelings for anything
else.

72.

TOWNSEND
Please pass my gratitude to the Queen
for the offer. I should very much like
to consider the matter for forty-eight
hours. If I may.
LASCELLES
Take longer. Seventy-two hours. A
week. Discuss it with your wife.
Closely. Make the right decision.
TOWNSEND
Sir.
The two MEN look at one another. No love lost.
LASCELLES
That’ll be all.
TOWNSEND turns, and walks out.
121

INT. CORRIDOR - SANDRINGHAM - DAY

121

TOWNSEND emerges from the room. Shaken by the conversation. A
PAGE is waiting for him.
PAGE
For you, Sir.
TOWNSEND
Thank you.
TOWNSEND opens the envelope, and pulls out the note inside..
He looks at the writing, then covers it, and looks left and
right in case anyone has noticed...
He looks at the writing again. This time we see it..
“I MUST SEE YOU”
122

EXT. SANDRINGHAM HOUSE - DAY

122

TOWNSEND goes out to a yard with Jeeps. He gets into one of
the jeeps, and drives out.
123

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
TOWNSEND drives out into the estate. Up ahead, he sees a
horse tethered...
TOWNSEND pulls up in his jeep.

73.

124

EXT. MEETING PLACE - DAY

124

There TOWNSEND meets MARGARET. She is inconsolable.
MARGARET
Hold me.
TOWNSEND
My poor, darling.
MARGARET allows him to envelop her in his arms. He holds her
tight. It’s almost paternal.
MARGARET
I need you so badly.
TOWNSEND
I’m here for you.
MARGARET
No, you’re not. How can you be? They
will post you somewhere else. They
will put you back to the Air Force,
and send you somewhere. I told my
mother she had to keep you, that she
had to insist on your staying. She
said she would do everything to try.
MARGARET looks up.
MARGARET
If they asked you, would you?
TOWNSEND
You’re asking the wrong question. Why
would I not?
They fall into one another’s arms.
125

INT. CABINET MEETING - DAY

125

The Cabinet is assembled. EDEN walks in, and takes his seat
in his regular chair.
EDEN
The PM won’t be joining us this
morning being very much tired with all
the emotion of yesterday.
SALISBURY
So where is he?
EDEN
(pointed)
He’s still asleep.
The cabinet ministers look at one another.

74.

EDEN
So in his absence, I will preside.
A round of clearing throats.
EDEN
The Queen’s flight is now over Italy,
having left El Adem airfield...
SALISBURY
Wait a minute, Foreign Secretary.
EDEN
What?
SALISBURY
If you are presiding over the meeting
on the PM’s behalf, shouldn’t you be
sitting in the appropriate chair.
SALISBURY indicates the empty PM’s chair; the only chair with
arms.
EDEN looks at the chair...
EDEN
I really don’t think...
EDEN stops himself. He looks back at his colleagues.
EDEN
Very well.
EDEN gets to his feet and walks over to the PM’s chair. The
significance of the moment is not lost on anyone.
EDEN pulls back the chair, looks at his fellow cabinet
colleagues, and sits in the chair.
The chair he craves with every fibre in his body.
EDEN
The Queen’s flight is now over Italy,
having left El Adem airfield in Libya
at 5 o’clock this morning. She is
expected to touch down in
approximately three hours. At the
Accession Council meeting yesterday it
was agreed that a cross-party
delegation would meet her, along with
Privy Councillors, etc...
SALISBURY looks round the room at the other ministers.
126

INT. DOWNING STREET - DAY
Afterwards: the plotters gather round EDEN.

126

75.

SALISBURY
You must have felt it. The respect in
the room. Their desire to be led. By
you.
EDEN
What else do you want me to do? Short
of pushing Winston under a bus, I
cannot force him out. I went to see
the King who was never able to have
that conversation with the PM. Events
now need to take their natural course.
He needs to stumble and he needs to
fall. Don’t forget, at present it’s
just a few of us that know just how
bad the situation is. It needs a
public humiliation to bring his
incapacity into the open.
SALISBURY
The eulogy.
EDEN
What?
SALISBURY
He’s going to have to address the
nation. Connect with the mood of the
country and lead from the front. You
think he’s in a fit state to do that?
EDEN
God, no. He’s in no state to do
anything. He will mix-up his words or
forget his lines. One way or another
it’ll be a disaster.
SALISBURY
Right.
EDEN
But shouldn’t we prevent that? Not for
his sake, but for all our sakes. It
might diminish the occasion.
SALISBURY
You know sometimes, Anthony, I think
you really only have yourself to blame
for your years in Winston’s shadow. If
you want the top job, you have to be
ruthless. It’s what people want from
their leaders. The killer instinct.
The absence of doubt. You yourself
said it needs a public humiliation.
I’m not suggesting you thrust a knife
in his heart.

76.

EDEN
Just to stand back and let him thrust
one into his own.
127

INT. DOWNING STREET - CHURCHILL’S BEDROOM - DAY

127

In his bedroom, CHURCHILL continues to snore, fast asleep.
Lost to the world. In the realm of his dreams.
The only remaining place where there are no plots against
him.
128

128

INT. PLANE - DAY

QUEEN and PHILIP are in the separate cabin reserved for them
at the back of the plane.
PHILIP looks out of a window.
PHILIP
Where will we live? As a family?
ELIZABETH
There will be pressure on us to move
to Buckingham Palace.
PHILIP
I would prefer not to do that.
Silence.
PHILIP (CONT’D)
I don’t want the children to grow up
in that mausoleum.
ELIZABETH
Just saying there will be pressure.
PHILIP
By all means use the place as an
office, but our home, our FAMILY home,
should remain at Clarence House.
ELIZABETH
That will be difficult.
PHILIP
Why? You always said you were never
happy in the palace yourself.
ELIZABETH
I wasn’t.
PHILIP
Then why repeat mistakes? Generation
after generation?
(MORE)

77.
PHILIP (cont'd)
In the interest of ‘tradition’? You’re
the person who can change it now.

ELIZABETH
All right. Well, let’s not rattle the
cage now.
PHILIP
I’m not rattling the cage.
ELIZABETH
You’re rattling the cage.
PHILIP
I am having a conversation.
ELIZABETH
In the wrong place at the wrong time.
PHILIP
You started it, dear.
ELIZABETH
There’ll be the right moment to
discuss turning everything on it’s
head...
PHILIP
(hands raised innocently)
I’m turning nothing on it’s head.
ELIZABETH
You’re turning ME on MY head.
PHILIP
I’m just saying there’s a brief moment
now where we should strike, and catch
them all by surprise.
ELIZABETH
Who?
PHILIP
The old guard. The firm. Who’ll want
to keep everything exactly as it was.
And who’ll want to keep me out of the
picture.
ELIZABETH
You know your problem? You see
conspiracy where there is none.
PHILIP
I see it where it’s obvious. Your head
is buried in the sand, like all the
other ostriches in your family.
She rolls her eyes.

78.

ELIZABETH
This isn’t a moment to ‘strike’, and
‘catch them by surprise’. This isn’t a
military operation.
PHILIP
More’s the pity.
ELIZABETH
My father has died. I have no thoughts
beyond that. Now if you’d pass me that
coat...
PHILIP passes ELIZABETH the black coat.
ELIZABETH
I’d like to get ready.
PHILIP nods, and leaves her alone in the cabin.
129

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - DAY

129

ATTLEE, CLEMENT DAVIES, LORD WOOLTON, HARRY CROOKSHANK,
SALISBURY, LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD CHANCELLOR, and the DUKE OF
GLOUCESTER stand by the airport.
All in sombre, respectful mourning wear they stand awkwardly
awaiting the arrival of the plane, saying little to one
another.
A car arrives and a frail-looking CHURCHILL gets out. He
walks over and takes his position standing next to EDEN.
EDEN
(pointed)
Good morning.
WINSTON
Anthony.
EDEN
I trust you slept well.
CHURCHILL turns; looks at EDEN.
WINSTON
I did.
A pause.
WINSTON
Though I was briefly troubled by a bad
dream.
EDEN
Oh.

79.

WINSTON
Would you like to hear it?
EDEN
Not particularly.
WINSTON
Go on. You may be able to shed light
on it. In my dream a close friend, a
family friend, and lifelong political
ally went to see the late King behind
my back and plotted against me.
EDEN looks at WINSTON..
WINSTON
What do you make of that?
EDEN
I’m afraid I don’t share the modish
fixation with the analysis of dreams.
WINSTON
But hearing it, what advice would you
give me?
EDEN
My advice would be simple. I recommend
that you spend more time awake.
A ripple among the politicians. The flight has arrived.
130

130

EXT. RUNWAY - DAY
The plane carrying the QUEEN taxis to a halt. Steps are
pushed to the door.
The first person to climb the steps is LASCELLES.

131

131

INT. PLANE - DAY
The QUEEN finishes buttoning the long black coat over her
beige dress. The door opens.
LASCELLES walks in. Bows from the neck.
LASCELLES
Your Majesty.
LASCELLES hands over a black, (feathered), hat.
LASCELLES
I’ve been asked to give you this.
ELIZABETH
Thank you.

80.

LASCELLES
(to CHARTERIS)
It’s all right, Charteris. I’ll take
over from here.
CHARTERIS
Yes, Sir. Your Majesty.
ELIZABETH
Thank you, Martin. For everything.
ELIZABETH shakes his hand, he goes. The OLD GUARD now closing
protectively in around the Crown.
LASCELLES
Ready, Ma’am?
PHILIP moves to escort her.
PHILIP
It’s all right. I’ll escort her down.
LASCELLES
No, Sir. If you don’t mind.
(a beat)
The Crown has precedence.
LASCELLES blocks PHILIP’s path. PHILIP is stung, “What?”,
then looks at ELIZABETH, who shoots him a look...
Then averts her eyes. And heads out of the door.
132

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - DAY

132

The QUEEN emerges from the plane. And walks slowly down the
steps.
Waiting for her: a sea of old, conservative, white-haired
MEN.
ELIZABETH so young, so feminine, so innocent by comparison.
She reaches the bottom of the steps, and is greeted by
CHURCHILL.
WINSTON
Your Majesty.
Followed by EDEN, SALISBURY, ATTLEE, MOUNTBATTEN, etc.
133

INT. BOAC PLANE - SAME TIME

133

PHILIP, a forgotten figure, watches the scene unfold from the
top of the steps. He is joined by MIKE PARKER.

81.

MIKE
Give it a few days. It’ll all settle
down.
PHILIP
No, it won’t. And you know it.
134

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

134

The QUEEN gets into one of the big black royal cars (known as
‘hearses’), joined by PHILIP.
The royal car, bearing the sovereign’s coat of arms on its
roof, drives away, royal standard fluttering.
135

INT. DOWNING STREET - NIGHT

135

A microphone is being prepared by technicians. Like
executioners preparing the gallows and the guillotine.
CHURCHILL walks into the room. Stares at the microphone.
He walks over to his seat. He pulls out a handwritten speech.
The producer nods solemnly.
CHURCHILL composes himself for a moment, then...
WINSTON
When the death of the King was
announced to us yesterday morning
there struck a deep and solemn note in
our lives which, as it resounded far
and wide, stilled the clatter and
traffic of twentieth-century life, and
made countless millions of human
beings around the world pause and look
around them.
136

EXT. SANDRINGHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

136

The Royal car carrying the QUEEN arrives outside Sandringham
House. Staff are lined up outside to greet their new
Sovereign.
WINSTON (V.O.)
The King was greatly loved by all his
peoples. He was respected as a man and
as a prince. The simple dignity of his
life, his manly virtues, his sense of
duty - when he assumed the heavy
burden of the Crown and succeeded his
brother - his example as a husband and
a father in his own family circle, his
courage in peace or war - all this we
have seen and we have greatly admired.

82.

The staff members bow and curtsey in respect and deference.
137

INT. SANDRINGHAM - NIGHT

137

ELIZABETH walks into Sandringham House where she is greeted
by the QUEEN MOTHER and Princess MARGARET.
WINSTON (V.O.)
The greatest shocks ever felt by this
island fell upon us in his reign.
Never in our long history were we
exposed to greater perils of invasion
and destruction. The late King lived
through every minute of this struggle
with a heart that never quavered and a
spirit undaunted.
A moment that is fraught with meaning and emotion.
First a tear-stained MARGARET greets her, with a curtsey,
indicating precedence.
WINSTON (V.O.)
Though deeply smitten by physical
afflictions he felt and shared the
sufferings of his peoples as if they
were his own. During these last months
the King walked with death as if death
were a companion, an acquaintance whom
he recognized and did not fear.
Then the QUEEN MOTHER. Curtseying, deeply, deferentially. And
kissing her daughter’s hand.
138

INT. DOWNING STREET - NIGHT

138

CHURCHILL continues with his broadcast, reading his speech...
WINSTON
In the end death came as a friend, and
after a happy day of sunshine and
sport, and after "good night" to those
who loved him best, he fell asleep as
every man or woman who strives to fear
God and nothing else in the world may
hope to do.
139

139
EXT. CHURCH OF ST. MARY MAGDALENE - SANDRINGHAM - SAME TIME
To establish. A 16th-Century, carrstone building on the
grounds of Sandringham. Used for private worship and
memorials by the royals for centuries.

83.

140

140
INT. CHURCH OF ST. MARY MAGDALENE - SANDRINGHAM - SAME TIME
ELIZABETH enters the Parish Church at Sandringham where an
open coffin lies, draped in the royal standard. Above her, a
chancel with carved angels frames the silver altar.
WINSTON (V.O.)
Now I must leave the treasures of the
past and turn to the future. Famous
have been the reigns of our queens.
Some of the greatest periods in our
history have unfolded under their
sceptres.
ELIZABETH approaches the coffin, and looks at her father,
etiolated, alabastered, blue-lipped.
WINSTON (V.O.)
Queen Elizabeth II, like her namesake,
Queen Elizabeth I, did not pass her
childhood in any certain expectation
of the Crown. She is also heir to all
our united strength and loyalty.
ELIZABETH bends down, and places a kiss on her father’s brow.
WINSTON (V.O.)
She comes to the throne at a time when
a mankind stands uncertainly poised on
the edge of catastrophe.
Then she turns, and walks out, holding in the tears. Not
wanting the ESTATE WORKERS to see her emotion.
WINSTON (V.O.)
Let us hope and pray that her
accession to our ancient Throne may be
the signal for a brightening salvation
of the human scene. Tomorrow the
proclamation of her sovereignty will
command the loyalty of her native land
and of all other parts of the British
Commonwealth and Empire.

141

INT. DOWNING STREET - NIGHT

141

CHURCHILL, visibly tired, voice beginning to fade, wraps up
the broadcast..
WINSTON
I, whose youth was passed in the
august, unchallenged and tranquil
glories of the Victorian era, may well
feel a thrill in invoking once more
the prayer and the anthem, "God save
the Queen!"

84.

CHURCHILL finishes. He looks up. The room - full of producers
and technicians and civil servants - is deathly quiet.
CHURCHILL
Was that all right?
No one able to speak. All blown away.
FADE TO BLACK:

INT. CORRIDOR - SANDRINGHAM - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

CHURCHILL is getting ready. CLEMMIE pops her head round the
corner..
CLEMMIE
You’re late.
WINSTON looks up with difficulty.
WINSTON
Almost there.
CLEMMIE
Unbecomingly late.

85.

CLEMMIE goes. CHURCHILL straightens, a cunning glint in his
eye. We realize his slowness is intentional.
“Snap”, a moment later the door opens again...
CLEMMIE
Un-pardon-ably late!
148

INT. ST. JAMES’S PALACE - DAY

148

CHURCHILL arrives outside St. JAMES’s. He enters the building
via the Ambassador’s Court Entrance. He walks slowly up
stairs, towards the large upstairs room. He reaches a door,
through which we hear the voice of the new QUEEN...
She reads her Accession statement. CHURCHILL listens...
ELIZABETH (O/S)
...at this time of deep sorrow, my
heart is too full for me to say more
to you to-day than that I shall always
work, as my father did throughout his
reign, to up-hold constitutional
government and to advance the
happiness and prosperity of my
Peoples, spread as they are all the
world over.
“CLICK”, CHURCHILL enters the room.
149

INT. ST. JAMES’S PALACE - DAY

149

The room is packed with British establishment. The Court at
St. James’s. Lords, Ladies, Bishops, Government Ministers,
Privy Councilors, Mayor, Aldermen of the City of London...
Most wear grand, full ceremonial dress. Some wear morning
coats. All heads turn as CHURCHILL enters. Making an
entrance. As ever.
The QUEEN finishes...
ELIZABETH
I pray that God will help me to
discharge worthily the duties and
responsibilities of Sovereignty, this
heavy task that has been laid upon me
so early in my life.
CHURCHILL makes his way through the crowds. Reaches EDEN.
EDEN
You know, someone should buy you a new
watch.

86.

Both bow from the neck as the QUEEN passes them, leaving..
EDEN
You are incorrigible.
WINSTON
That may be, Anthony. But I am also
still leader.
CHURCHILL stands by as one after another of the white-haired
members of the establishment line up to congratulate him on
his speech.
EDEN walks away. Frustrated.
150

INT. CLARENCE HOUSE - DAY

150

ELIZABETH and PHILIP arrive back at CLARENCE HOUSE to be
greeted by their staff. A nanny steps forward.
NANNY
Welcome back, Ma’am.
ELIZABETH
Thank you.
NANNY
Will you come and see the children?
ELIZABETH
In a moment.
She walks down a corridor, and disappears into a room alone.
Her two children, CHARLES and ANNE are neglected.
One of the children is crying. PHILIP goes to tend to them.
151

ELIZABETH goes into a room, and locks the door behind her.

Affection beseech God, by whom Kings

happy Years to reign over us.
154

154

INT. ROOM - CLARENCE HOUSE - DAY

ELIZABETH suddenly, quite distressingly, bursts into tears.
Her shoulders shake and convulse with pent-up emotion. Tears
stream down her face.
Slowly, her emotions subside. The ripples fade away, leaving
calm, unbroken glass.
She wipes the tears from her face. She composes herself.
Concentrates.
Presently it’s as if there has been no emotion whatsoever.
The pain, fear, loneliness and mourning locked away deep
within her.
And the key thrown away.
It is the last time we will ever see her weep. Or express
emotion so freely.
ELIZABETH WINDSOR stares into the camera. Aged 26, but
already subjugated. Erased.
A prisoner within the gilded carapace that is...
...ELIZABETH REGINA.
BLACKOUT
