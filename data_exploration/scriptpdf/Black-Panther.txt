FATHER (CONT'D)
And when the time of man came , five
tribes
settled
on it and called
it
Wakanda. The tribes
lived in
constant
war with each other until
a warrior
shaman received
a vision
from the Panther goddess Bast who
led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
plant that granted him super human
strength , speed, and instincts
.
A visual
representation
of the five tribes
emerges as hands
from the sand animation,
and we see them unite , and then
break apart as conflict
arises . Bashenga rises
above the
conflict
and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding
to unite
the tribes .

The warrior
became King and the

T'CHALLA
My name is King T'Challa , son of
King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign
ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and
for the first
time in our history
we will be sharing
our knowledge
and resources
with the outside
world. Wakanda will no longer watch
from the shadows . We cannot , we
must not. We will work to be an
example of how we as brothers
and
sisters
on this Earth should treat
each other . Now more than ever ,
illusions
of division
threaten
our
very e x istence.
We all know the
truth : more connects
us than
separates
us . In times of crisis ,
the wise build bridges , while the
foolish
build barriers
. We must
find a way to look after
one
another,
as if we were one single
tribe .

of WORLDLEADERS look around , bemused,

have to offer .
