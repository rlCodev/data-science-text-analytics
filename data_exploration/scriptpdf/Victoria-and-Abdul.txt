Words appear on screen:

agra, 1886
britain has formally ruled india
for twenty-eight years
int. abdul’s room, india
A darkened room. Someone is moving in the darkness. Then the
shutters of the room are thrown wide open and the blinding light
reveals: Abdul, twenty-four, smiling into the sun – we hear sound of
the muezzin’s call to prayer in the distance.
ext. roof top, agra
Abdul praying in the glorious sunshine.We see all of Agra below him,
the Taj Mahal in the distance.
ext. street, agra
Abdul rushes out of a squalid doorway into the bustle of the street.
As he hurries through the jammed streets he acknowledges people as
he goes, making his way past the lame and sick, through crowds, spice
stalls. Suddenly he accidentally bumps into a white colonial officer:
officer
Idiot!
The officer has already turned away so Abdul hurries on through the
dusty streets.
ext. agra gaol. the same
Donkeys, a dog pisses on the wall. Abdul hurries in.

int. agra gaol
Abdul bows to the guard enthusiastically. The lugubrious guard
unlocks several locks on the rusting iron gate. The door slams shut.
Abdul hurries along the corridor.We see pitiful inmates, all at looms
making carpets, watched by bored, unshaven guards.
Abdul rushes to his high desk and starts on the Sisyphean task of
compiling the prison ledgers with huge concentration. Abdul looks up to
see the prison guard.
guard
Tyler wants to see you. Now.
int. tyler’s office. the same
A faded, mildewed monochrome of a young Queen Victoria on the wall.
Abdul is underneath looking nervously at Tyler, the Prison Governor.
tyler
Ah, Mr Karim. I wanted to speak to you about the carpets
we sent to the Exhibition.
abdul
There is problem, sir?
tyler
No. No. The carpets went down very well. In fact the
Governor General has received a letter from the Royal
Household thanking him personally. The whole thing’s been
such a success he has decided to present the Queen with a
mohar as part of the Jubilee.
abdul
A mohar, sir?
tyler
A mohar. Apparently it’s a sort of ceremonial coin, rather
like a medal. I have been asked to find someone tall to
present it. Well, you’re the tallest person here.
abdul
Mr Tyler! When will she be arriving, sir?
6

tyler
Not in Agra. In England.
abdul
England?!
tyler
You’ll present the mohar at an official function. Like an
equerry.
abdul
On a horse?
tyler
I don’t think there’ll be a horse.
abdul
An equerry always has a horse, Mr Tyler, sir.
tyler
Well, maybe not like an equerry exactly. They were actually
after Hindus but I thought you’d do. What do you say?
abdul
Are you sure there isn’t a horse?
int. queen’s bedroom. england
Another dark room. The curtains are thrown, light streams into the
room.We see Mrs Tuck at the window. In the shadows is a large bed
into which a enormous mound appears to be upholstered.
mrs tuck
Good morning, Your Majesty.
We cut to:
ext. entrance to docks
Abdul is now with Tyler, a portly Englishman, Bigge, and what looks
like his short, squat Indian manservant.
tyler
This is Mr Bigge – extra Groom in Waiting to the Royal
Household who will be in charge. This is Abdul.
7

bigge
This is Mohammed.
tyler
He’s very short.
bigge
We had to swop him at the last minute. The tall guy had an
accident with an elephant.
Abdul beams at Mohammed, who is distinctly unhappy.
abdul
Hi!
Mohammed looks sourly and does not respond.
int. queen’s bedchamber
A group of straining footmen roll Queen Victoria over and then
manhandle her out of bed.
ext. on deck at sea. day
Abdul and Mohammed standing in front of Bigge, who has a chart on
a tripod.
bigge
At the top there’s the Private Secretary, then there are the
Ladies in Waiting, the Upper Servants, the lower Upper
Servants, the members of the Household, the Head of the
Household staff – splitting into three parts: the head of the
Bedchamber, the personal head of staff, the Butler in
Chief, who is in charge of the Household Butler, the
kitchen factotum, head of kitchen, the head of waiting staff,
the ordinary waiting staff (Windsor), the table maids, then
you. Any questions?
abdul
Who will have the mohar, sir?
bigge
I’m not exactly sure, as yet. I suspect you will both carry it.
On a cushion.
8

abdul
We both have a cushion?
bigge
No, there’ll only be one cushion. Between you.
abdul
Can we have a cushion now, sir?
bigge
You’ll have to mime the cushion.
abdul
I don’t understand, sir.
bigge
Pretend. You’ll have to pretend the cushion is there. Like
this. The key to good service is standing still and moving
backward. The most important thing is you must not look
at her.
abdul
But how will we present the mohar, sir?!
bigge
You put out the cushion and avert your gaze, appropriately.
Her Majesty will take the mohar and you will egress
retrospectively in a stately manner.
mohammed
What an arsehole.
int. outside the queen’s bedchamber
A line of dressers, ladies-in-waiting, footmen, equerries etc. all parade
into the Queen’s bedchamber.
int. cabin. at sea
Abdul and Mohammed in their tiny cell. Mohammed has a pile of
buns. He passes one to Abdul.

9

mohammed
Have you any idea how cold it is? We’re gonna bloody
die there.
abdul
Why on earth did you agree to come?
mohammed
Had no choice. The tall guy fell off an elephant and I got
drafted in at the last moment. Five thousand miles to
present a bloody medal.
abdul
But it’s a very great honour.
mohammed
Honour?! My father fought in the Mutiny. Have you
tasted English food? They eat pig’s blood.
abdul
They do not eat pig’s blood!
mohammed
I’m telling you they have pig’s blood in sausages. And
the brains of sheep. The place is barbaric.
abdul
Not to worry.
Abdul shows Mohammed a little tin containing a load of spices.
A present from my mother.
mohammed
My advice: eat as much as you can before we hit land.
He passes Abdul another bun.
Let’s give her the medal and get the hell back home.
tilbury docks. day
The huge exodus. Abdul, Mohammed come down the gangplank with
Arthur Bigge.

10

bigge
Civilisation!
The posh English people buffet Abdul and Mohammed in the mad
rush to the quayside. Finally, they look at the hawkers, scrawny
porters, the distinctly uncivilised detritus of Victorian London. A beggar
holds out his hand to Abdul.
beggar
Give uz a farthing.
int. queen’s bedchamber. the same
The Queen is sitting on a stool with her back to us. A gaggle of
dressers stand with the Queen’s garments.
mrs tuck
Arms.
The Queen puts her arms up.
int. gentleman tailor’s, london. day
Wood-panelled room. Men in suits. Abdul and Mohammed are dressed
in strange Indian costumes.
tailor
Arms.
Abdul puts his arms up as the tailor fixes a sash around him.
bigge
Splendid.
tailor
We copied them from some drawings in the British Museum.
abdul
A sash is not traditional, sir.
tailor
(to Bigge)
The Indian drawings didn’t seem very Indian – so we made
some innovations. We need it to look authentic.
11

bigge
It looks jolly good to me.
int. the queen’s bedchamber
A cloud of powder as Mrs Tuck applies a vast powder brush to the
Queen. Just as she is about to emerge from the cloud we cut to
Ponsonby, Keeper of the Privy Purse and Private Secretary to the
Sovereign, reading the day’s itinerary.
ponsonby
Nine o’clock: breakfast in London. Quarter to ten:
Trooping of the Colour. Eleven o’clock: elevenses with the
Crown Prince Alexander of Norway, the Norwegian
Ambassador, the Chief Under-Secretary of State for the
Southern Norwegian Provinces and the Junior UnderSecretary . . .
ext. courtyard, windsor castle. day
A carriage rushes into the courtyard. Abdul, Mohammed and Arthur
Bigge alight. Abdul and Mohammed look in amazement at their
surroundings. Over which we hear Ponsonby continuing his speech:
ponsonby
(voice-over)
Midday: luncheon at Buckingham Palace. Two o’clock:
ceremonial drive down the Mall . . .
int. the same, queen’s bedchamber
Mrs Tuck places the Queen’s bonnet on.We still haven’t seen her face.

Including the ceremonial presentation of a mohar.
int. state room, windsor castle. day
Abdul, Mohammed and Bigge arrive in a vast hall. Tables are laid for
an enormous dinner. A crowd of secretaries, officials, waiting staff and
other servants are being instructed by Alick Yorke, the portly Director
of Ceremonies. He stops mid-sentence. Everybody looks at Abdul and
Mohammed in amazement.
bigge
The Hindoos, sir.
alick yorke
But they are completely different sizes.
bigge
There was an incident with an elephant.
alick yorke
But what on earth are they wearing?
bigge
It’s ceremonial, sir.
alick yorke
On arrival Her Majesty will process to the main doors.
Fanfares. Ceremonial entrance. The Royal Entourage will

He grabs Abdul.
alick yorke
– will come from the north-west entrance. Process together.
You –
He grabs Mohammed.
alick yorke
– will come to here, and you will stand here – no, a little
bit . . . that’s it. Presenting the tray thus – the Viceroy will
indicate to Her Majesty . . .
abdul
Tray?
Everything stops.
abdul
I thought it was a cushion.
alick yorke
Who said anything about a cushion? You will present the
tray . . .
mohammed
What will I do?
alick yorke
You will stand perfectly still and move backward when
required. Her Majesty takes the mohar. What is a mohar?
an assistant
It’s a coin, sir. Issued by the Moghul Empire.
alick yorke
Why are we presenting it here?! Whatever you do you must
not look at Her Majesty. You will bow again. Then moving
backwards you will turn to your left – you will lead – thus –
and you will process down the hall to be met by Mr Bates
14

who will walk you back to the north wall where you will
stand till the end of the meal. Would you like me to run
through that again?
A page rushes in.

Mr Yorke. She’s leaving Paddington!
alick yorke
Everybody out.
ext. countryside. day
The Queen’s train. Children wave flags as it passes.
int. antechamber. the same
Hundreds of guests are milling.
int. kitchens, windsor castle
chef
Where are the bloody quenelles? You two. Out of it!
Abdul and Mohammed are evicted from the kitchen by the chef. Then
a voice:
voice
She’s at the station!
chef
Jesus Christ! SHE’S AT THE STATION!
Abdul and Mohammed are grabbed by Alick Yorke.
alick yorke
For God’s sake just wait where you were told. Open the
doors!
int. long corridor. day
A little pageboy runs in shouting:
15

little pageboy
Open the doors! Open the doors! Open the doors!
int. the hall
Ushers let the waiting guests into the main hall, all agog with
anticipation.
int. side corridor. the same
Abdul and Mohammed stand with a huge line of waiters all ready to
start the service.

Carriages sweep past.

A pageboy runs at full pelt.

She’s coming! She’s coming!
int. the same, hall
The guests are by their chairs. A fanfare.

Abdul and Mohammad peering out behind Alick Yorke, who looks at
his pocket watch and shouts:

The soup!

int. the same, corridor
The pageboy running.

Soup! Soup!
int. kitchens
chef
Soup!
int. the hall
A fanfare. The main doors fly open. The fanfare reaches its climax.
Enter the Queen.We see her properly for the very first time. She is a
tiny, almost spherical figure, old, frail, glum and dreadfully tired.
Ponsonby leads her to her seat. The entourage follow: the Prince of
Wales, laughing coarsely with Lady Churchill, Dr Reid, various
dignitaries. All completely casual. Everyone else in the hall is frigidly
agog, craning to see the little old lady at the centre. She sits, then utters
an audible sigh of relief. Her bowl of soup is placed in front of her.
She attacks it greedily making a disgusting slurping noise as she eats.
everybody starts to eat.
int. corridor. the same
Abdul and Mohammed try to have a gander but are pushed out of the
way by Alick Yorke.
int. hall. the same
The Queen has soup all around her mouth and is scraping the bowl to
get the last bit. Then she is finished in record time. She plonks her
spoon on the bowl and cleans her chin with the napkin. Quick as a
flash a waiter removes the bowl. Further down the table, as guests are
amiably enjoying the conversation around them, suddenly waiters
snatch the bowls – still full of soup. Dr Reid addresses a startled diner:

17

dr reid
I’m afraid you have to be quick. They take it off you as
soon as she’s done.
int. the same, corridor
Scores and scores of waiters rush past Abdul and Mohammed carrying
soup bowls.
alick yorke
One down. Six to go.
Bigge appears with the mohar on a tray.
bigge
I have the mohar.
alick yorke
Is that it?!
head waiter
Sir, the fish course.
alick yorke
(shouting instructions)
The fish course!
int. hall
The babble of excited chatter. Everyone around the Queen is
animated. The Queen ignores it all and is shovelling quenelles into her
mouth. Cut to her polishing off the boeuf braisé, then tearing apart a
pheasant.
We see Lady Churchill laughing. Lady Phipps, a skinny, terrifiedlooking Lady in Waiting is eating salad primly. Back to the Queen:
her plate is clean and she is nodding off.
ponsonby
Profiteroles, Your Majesty.
A profiterole is presented and the Queen immediately comes to life.

18

int. the same, corridor
Abdul waits anxiously as streams of waiters bring back the plates from
dessert.
alick yorke
The profiteroles have gone. Gentlemen . . .
Alick Yorke makes a final adjustment to the mohar.
alick yorke
Now. Process. Turn. Bow. Present. And absolutely no
sodding eye contact what-so-ever!
Abdul takes a huge breath, looks nervously at Mohammed. A trumpet
sounds and they walk up the hall. Everybody turns to see the two
Indians process with the mohar. The Queen is now talking to the
Viceroy and is taking no notice at all of the ceremony. Abdul and
Mohammed can see her from the corner of their eye. They reach the
head of the table and stop. They turn. Bow. The Queen is still talking
and pays them no attention. Ponsonby explains:
ponsonby
A gift from the Colony of India. A mohar, Your Majesty.
The Queen turns and looks at the mohar, incredulous.
ponsonby
A coin from the Mughal Empire. In honour of your service
to the sub-continent.
Abdul presents the tray bowing his head low. The Queen takes the coin,
utterly bemused. Another servant puts a cushion on the table for it to
rest on. Abdul doesn’t quite know what to do. Ponsonby angrily indicates
for them to leave. Abdul takes the hint. They back away as trained.
queen victoria
Are we done?
ponsonby
We still have coffee, Your Majesty.
Queen Victoria raises her eyes to heaven. Then suddenly looks across at
Abdul. He stops, frozen. He smiles at her. She looks at him. The title
appears on screen:
19

VICTORIA AND ABDUL
We hear Mr Bigge sharply chide Abdul.
bigge
Eyes!
His smile falls and he drops his head.
int. darkened room. the following day, morning
As before: a dark room, a curtain is drawn by Mrs Tuck. The room fills
with sunlight and we see we are in the Queen’s bedchamber.
mrs tuck
Good morning, Your Majesty.
Again we see the Queen seemingly upholstered into her bed. The group
of servants approach to extract her.
int. ðressing room. the same
Regal music. The Queen immobile in the centre of the room, as before.
mrs tuck
Arms.
The Queen lifts her arms. This time we witness the whole unedifying
affair. The dresser arrives with a dress and has some trouble getting it
over her head. Finally her head is prised out of the garment. The Queen
makes no expression. A gaggle of ladies in waiting and maidservants
hand jewels, brooches and various pieces of the Queen’s garb to Mrs
Tuck who expertly puts these on. Over all of this we hear Ponsonby
outline the days activities..
ponsonby
(voice-over)
Breakfast with the Royal Princes of Belgium. An audience
with the Sultan of Dubai where you will be presented with
the Diamond of Ooojay. The garden party where you will
receive the Right Honourable Marharani of Cooch Behar,
Huran Singh, the Maharajah of Karpurthala . . .
20

int. the same, the queen’s breakfast room
The Queen is eating a goose egg with a silver spoon. Dr Reid and a
phalanx of silent flunkeys are in attendance. Ponsonby is finishing his
itinerary for the day:
ponsonby
. . . And the Crown Princess Lili’uokalani.
queen victoria
Who on earth is she?
ponsonby
Monarch and only Queen Regnant of the Kingdom of
Hawaii, Your Majesty. She has composed a song for you on
the ukelele – but we have managed to put her off. Then the
afternoon audience with Prime Minister Salisbury.
dr reid
And your movements, Your Highness?
queen victoria
None to speak of.
dr reid
Not even during the day?
queen victoria
We last moved on Sunday evening.
dr reid
I fear the celebratory dinners are taking their toll. May I
suggest some Benger’s Mixture, Your Majesty?
queen victoria
I refuse to eat Benger’s. It’s baby food.
dr reid
But it is imperative, Your Majesty, that the royal colon
receives a little roughage.
queen victoria
Is there anything else?
ponsonby
Was Your Highness pleased with the mohar?
21

queen victoria
The what?
ponsonby
The mohar. The ceremonial coin presented yesterday by
the Indian servants.
queen victoria
I thought the tall one was terribly handsome.
int. the same, corridor
Arthur Bigge running at a surprising lick.
int. spiral staircase, arse end of windsor castle
Bigge runs up to a door at the top. He throws it open.We see two small
empty beds are crushed together.
ext. courtyard. the same
Abdul and Mohammed with their tiny suitcases are about to board a
carriage. Arthur Bigge comes running breathlessly into the courtyard.
bigge
Stop!
He is almost doubled up with exhaustion. He catches his breath.
Slight change of plan.
Mohammed is horrified.
ext. garden party. afternoon
Abdul and Mohammed in costume. Bigge is in a food tent, guests mill
around outside. They are near a table laden with puddings as they
receive instructions.
bigge
You must not talk to any guests. Nod or bow but please do
not interact with anybody other than the serving staff. I will
22

come to you when the Queen is seated and you will present
the pudding, as requested.
Abdul looks at the jelly on the table.
abdul
Excuse me, but what is it?
bigge
That is a jelly. A pudding made from the liquor of fruit.
Abdul and Mohammed survey it with great curiosity.
abdul
How do they get it so stiff?
bigge
Gelatin: a by-product of cow bone.
They look at the wobbling mass in horror.
mohammed
Barbarians!
int. queen’s marquee. windsor castle. day
The Queen is sitting at a table with Lord Salisbury.
lord salisbury
There’s another famine in India, more trouble in Ireland,
I’m afraid. Suez is a perennial nightmare and I’m afraid the
Boers are at it again.
queen victoria
Is there any good news, Prime Minister?
lord salisbury
We have decided to annex Zululand, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Whatever for?
lord salisbury
To prevent the Transvaal having access to the sea.

23

queen victoria
Is that absolutely necessary?
lord salisbury
We really have to box in the Boers if we possibly can, Your
Majesty.
queen victoria
Prime Minister, you really are terribly depressing.
Food starts to arrive.
Ah, luncheon!
ext. the same, table at the garden party
A wobbling jelly.We pull up to see Abdul carefully carrying it, followed
by Mohammed who has his own. Queen Victoria is at the table,
looking dour and fearsome. Abdul starts to panic as the jelly starts
wobbling perilously on the plate. The more he nears the Queen the
more errant the giant jelly becomes.With a great deal of sweat and
consternation Abdul navigates the jelly to Her Majesty.
abdul
Jelly, Your Majesty.
Abdul puts the jelly in front of the Queen, her eyes light up. Abdul
bows ostentatiously, then drops to his knees. The entire table of guests
crane round to see what he is doing. Bigge and Ponsonby look on in
horror. The Queen looks down curiously. The whole Royal Household
seem to hold their breath. Abdul suddenly lunges down – everyone
gasps. Kneeling down, he kisses her feet, rises, bows again and retreats
backwards. Everyone is astonished. The Queen is startled then her face
breaks into a smile.
queen victoria
I feel a great deal better.
She picks up her golden spoon and looks at the jelly.
ext. the same, behind the food tent
An extremely red-faced Bigge has Abdul by the collar.
24

bigge
What the hell were you thinking?!
abdul
You said present the jelly.
bigge
I didn’t say kiss the feet of the Empress of India.
abdul
I thought it would cheer her up.
ponsonby
What on earth’s going on here?! Her Majesty has requested
Mr Karim and Mr Baksh to be her personal footmen for
the rest of the Jubilee.
int. staircase. windsor castle. day
Abdul and Mohammed follow Bigge up a staircase:
mohammed
You stupid bloody idiot. All you had to do was give her
jelly.
int. outside the queen’s writing room. day
They’ve reached Ponsonby.
ponsonby
Gentlemen. (To Abdul.) She wants you to stand by the
writing desk. (To Bigge.) He can stand by the door.
int. writing room. the same
Abdul stands to attention. The Queen is led in with ceremony. She sits
down. Her pens are presented by a flunkey. The flunkey bows and goes
off to stand by the door. Abdul is standing to attention right by her
side, trying not to show his unease.
queen victoria
Don’t worry. I’m not going to eat you.
25

The Queen takes a piece of headed notepaper and starts writing.
To Doctor Reid . . . A very successful movement . . . this
morning at eight a.m. . . .
int. corridor, outside the writing room
Bigge, various Ladies in Waiting and the two flunkeys. They are trying
to look through the keyhole.
bigge
What’s he doing?
int. writing room. the same
The Queen is deeply absorbed in her letter writing. She signs the letter
with a flourish. Then suddenly she is surprised by Abdul who appears
at her shoulder with a blotter. He blots her writing and smiles at her.
queen victoria
Thank you, Mr . . .
abdul
Abdul. Abdul Karim. I am always writing. In India. I’m
writing all the day, every day.
queen victoria
Really. So in India you’re not a servant.
abdul
No. In India I am writing in my very big book.
queen victoria
You’re writing a book!
abdul
Oh yes. I am writing every name, who they are, what they
will be. This is my life. Every day I am writing. From the
morning to the night.
queen victoria
And this is fiction?

26

abdul
No, this is true. Everything I write is the very truth.
queen victoria
I don’t understand, if you are an author why you are here,
presenting the . . . thing, the . . .
abdul
The mohar. It is my humble privilege to serve Her Majesty.
I was the one who chose your carpets.
queen victoria
The carpets?
abdul
For the exhibition. The Viceroy asked Mr Tyler but actually
it was me. You have to have very good eye for the carpets.
This is a very nice one. For example.
They look at the carpet beneath them.
abdul
Very tight knots. This is the sign of a very nice carpet. The
art of carpets came to India with the great Emperor Akbar.
The skill of a great carpet is to bring all the different
threads together and we weave something we can stand on.
queen victoria
You seem to know an awful lot about it.
abdul
My family were carpet makers. But now I write in the
book. Life is like the carpet. We weave in and out to make
a pattern.
queen victoria
How very true. That is a very beautiful image.
abdul
It is a very beautiful carpet. Look at this – here is a bird of
freedom caught forever in the design.
queen victoria
So in India you are a poet?
27

abdul
No. I just make a ledger of the prisoners.
queen victoria
Indeed we are all prisoners.
abdul
Indeed we are, Your Majesty.
int. the same, anteroom
Lady Phipps is listening at the door.
lady phipps
Apparently he’s a poet!
bigge
A poet?!
Suddenly the doors burst open, out comes the Queen followed by
Abdul. Mohammed hisses in Hindi:
mohammed
What the hell are you playing at?
int. abdul and mohammed’s cell. night
A tiny room with two beds squashed together. Mohammed is shivering.
abdul
I was just trying to be friendly.
Abdul is breathing out, fascinated by his breath freezing.
mohammed
Stop being friendly.
abdul
She’s a very nice person.
mohammed
She is the tyrannical oppressor of our entire country.
And if we don’t get out of here we’ll die of bloody cold.

28

Mohammed wraps himself in his blanket and turns away. Abdul
carries on blowing out frozen exhalations.
mohammed
Will you stop doing that!
ext. gardens. windsor castle. day
Ponsonby with Dr Reid and Lady Churchill are hiding behind some
trees so they can spy on the Queen and Abdul. Ponsonby looks through
binoculars.
ponsonby
You realise this is the third day in a row.
ext. canopied writing station. windsor castle. day
The Queen finishes writing. Abdul blots her copy. She closes the book.
He goes back to ‘standing sentry’. Then the Queen turns her attention
directly to him.
queen victoria
So Mr Abdul. May I ask you which part of India are you
from?
abdul
I am from Agra. The Taj Mahal. You have been to the Taj
Mahal?
queen victoria
No.
abdul
Oh, it is the most marvellous building in the entire world.
The Crown of Palaces. It was built by Shah Jahan, the
grandson of the great Akbar, to remember his dead wife,
Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childhood with their
fourteenth child.
queen victoria
Goodness.

29

abdul
He was so upset with grief. He brought the greatest
architects from Persia and Afghanistan to build the Taj
Mahal.
queen victoria
It certainly sounds like a handsome building. I would very
much like to see it.
abdul
Oh, it is beautiful, Your Majesty. All white marble. And
Mumtaz laid inside. All of that beauty for the dead Queen.
queen victoria
How romantic.
abdul
Oh yes. And he wrote a poem:
‘The sight of this building brings me sad sighs;
The sun and the moon have tears in their eyes.’
But it makes everyone so happy. Agra is very beautiful.
Shah Jahan built the Red Fort, the Gardens of Shalimar,
and the Peacock Throne.
queen victoria
The Peacock Throne?
abdul
Oh, it was the most beautiful throne in all the world. A
throne of gold with peacocks on it. And in the throne was
the Koh-i-Noor. He would look at the Taj Mahal through
the diamond.
queen victoria
But I have the Koh-i-Noor. I have it as a brooch.
abdul
Do you?!
queen victoria
It was given to me by the East India Company. It wasn’t
very shiny so Albert had it recut. So what happened to the
Peacock Throne?
30

abdul
I don’t know, they smashed it up.
queen victoria
How awful.
abdul
Oh, they are always smashing things up. All the British
soldiers have taken the jewels from the Taj Mahal.
queen victoria
British soldiers?!
abdul
Oh yes, after the Mutiny.

to boot.
Lady Churchill grabs the binoculars.

What on earth does she see in him?
We see Abdul from Lady Churchill’s point of view.
lady churchill
Well, he is rather handsome.
ext. the same, avenue of trees
Queen Victoria continues talking to Abdul as they walk.

queen victoria
But what happened to Shah Jahan?
abdul
He was overthrown by his son and died in Agra Fort.
queen victoria
The wickedness of children.
abdul
They buried him in the Taj Mahal next to his wife. They
put an inscription: ‘Here lies Shah Jahan who left this world
to the Banquet Hall of Eternity.’
queen victoria
The Banquet Hall of Eternity.
abdul
Oh yes, it is a banquet when we leave here.
queen victoria
I rather like that idea. You seem very well informed, Mr
Abdul.
abdul
Oh, these are famous stories in Uttar Pradesh. You should
go there.
queen victoria
Oh, I can never go there. I am forbidden.
abdul
Forbidden?
queen victoria
They fear I would be assassinated.
abdul
But you are the Empress of India.
queen victoria
Exactly. (Proudly.) You know I’ve been shot at four times.
And someone came for me with a knife!

32

abdul
Goodness. So you have never seen an India street, or a stall
of spices.
queen victoria
No.
abdul
Oh, the spices. Cardamom, turmeric, cumin, coriander.
Garam masala.
queen victoria
What is garam masala?
abdul
It’s what you put into the sauce. You have never tasted
Indian food? A dahl? A rogan josh? Oh they are the greatest
dishes in the world! Biryani with mango chutney?
queen victoria
Mango chutney?
abdul
Oh yes, a chutney made of mango.
queen victoria
A mango?
abdul
Oh, the mango is the Queen of Fruit.
queen victoria
What does it taste like?
abdul
A mango is the most delicious fruit in all the world. Like an
orange and a peach.
int. corridor. the same
Ponsonby and the ladies in waiting are accompanying Queen Victoria
down the corridor. Abdul and Mohammed in tow.

33

queen victoria
Ponsonby. I would like a mango.
ponsonby
A mango?
queen victoria
Yes, I would like to taste a mango.
ponsonby
It’s impossible. They only grow in India, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
I am the Empress of India, so have one sent. I hope you
will like Scotland, Abdul.
ext. top of the moor. scotland. day
Scottish mists. The vast landscape of Scotland. A train of flunkies
come into shot carrying tables, chairs, carpets. Ponsonby, Lady
Churchill, Miss Phipps and Reid struggle up with them. Queen
Victoria comes into view close to the camera. She points a finger.
queen victoria
Here!
ext. wild promontory. day
Queen Victoria is sitting at her ‘tea’ table, formally set up and replete
with every unnecessary accoutrement. It overlooks spectacular scenery,
but Queen Victoria behaves as if she was in her back garden. Abdul
and Mohammed stand to attention in the background. Mohammed
sneezes. Butlers and maids serve the tea. Queen Victoria is very well
wrapped up. She gorges herself on a sponge cake. Everyone else is cold
and miserable. Ponsonby whispers to Dr Reid:
ponsonby
It’s alright for her. She’s upholstered.
The hand of the serving man shakes as he pours the tea.
queen victoria
How do you like your new Scottish costumes?
34

abdul
They’re very scratchy, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Everything in Scotland is scratchy. (To Ponsonby.) When
does Bertie come?
ponsonby
Tomorrow, Your Majesty. He is on his way from Monte
Carlo.
The Queen takes a slurp of the tea then puts the cup on the table.
Suddenly there’s a splish in the teacup. Then a pitter-pat as rain hits
the table cloth.
ext. vicinity of the wild promontory. scotland. day
Torrential rain. Queen Victoria is being led along by a river by a
ghillie with an umbrella. Behind her, Abdul and Mohammed,
Ponsonby and Reid are all getting soaked.
dr reid
I hate Scotland.
int. the same, balmoral
A piper plays very close to Dr Reid and Ponsonby who both blow their
noses and wince at the infernal racket. It seems everyone now has a
cold. The Household are sitting round in misery. The Queen is seated
at the centre and is tapping her foot delicately as one of the ghillies is
doing a dance in front of her. There is forced merriment from the staff.
Mohammed and Abdul are standing at the side, watching the
proceedings.
ghillie
(in incomprehensible Scots)
Ye must be the Hindoos. Very nice to meet ye.
Incomprehension from Abdul and Mohammed.
ghillie
Ye must be the Hindoos. Ye. Must. Be. The. Hin. Doos.
35

The piping stops.
queen victoria
More! More!
ghillie
I wish she’d bloody well go to bed.
The Ghillie wearily knocks back a dram from his hip flask. The piping
starts again. Lady Phipps yawns. The unfortunate dancing Ghillie
wearily raises his arms for another reel.
int. staff corridor. night
Abdul and Mohammed walk to bed. Ahead of them is a butler, with
a tray, careering from wall to wall. They pass an open door and inside
see the kitchen staff with bottles of whisky open and someone playing
the fiddle. Suddenly the music stops. They all look at Abdul and
Mohammed looking in at them. The door closes. Abdul and Mohammed
look at the closed door. The strathspey starts up again.
int. queen’s study. day
The Queen is sitting at her desk, Abdul by her side. A servant comes
in and puts down the boxes. Ponsonby blows his nose and takes her
through it.
ponsonby
Your boxes.
queen victoria
Thank you.
ponsonby
And the blank journal you requested.
Ponsonby puts on his glasses and takes a pen out of his pocket ready
to get down to work.
queen victoria
You may go.
Ponsonby waits. He is confused.
36

queen victoria
I am perfectly capable of working through the boxes. Abdul
is very helpful with his blotter.
ponsonby
But these are parliamentary papers, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
I am aware of that.
ponsonby
But Abdul is a servant. He cannot assist with the boxes.
queen victoria
I am the Queen of England. I will have whatever help with
my boxes that I require.
Ponsonby is completely banjaxed by the turn of events.
int. the same, outside the queen’s room
Ponsonby emerges wiping his brow. Mohammed is standing outside the
room, as is Lady Churchill. They look to Ponsonby to discover the
royal news.
ponsonby
He’s helping her with the boxes.
int. the same, queen’s study
Now the Queen and Abdul are alone she turns to him.
queen victoria
I want you to teach me Indian.
abdul
Indian?
queen victoria
Hindu. Whatever it is you speak.
abdul
Are you sure?

37

queen victoria
Of course I am sure.
abdul
But why would you want to speak Hindi?
queen victoria
I am Empress of India. Look. I have ordered a book. I want
you to give me private lessons.
abdul
I can’t teach you Hindi.
queen victoria
Why ever not?
abdul
You are the Empress of India. You must learn Urdu. The
language of the Mughals. Oh there are a thousand
languages in India but Urdu is the most noble. The
difference is when you write it down. In Urdu you write
like this.
He demonstrates it.
This is Persian script. Just like Arabic. And for Hindi you
write like this – in Devanagari:
He demonstrates.
The Persian script is most superior.
queen victoria
I see.

Apani utkrsta sabaka kelie apa abdula dhan yavada!

That’s it. You did it. Now write it down.

A new fat arse is on show as its owner bends in to look through the

Bertie!

Mother!
queen victoria
Were you spying on me?

40

bertie
Were you learning Urdu?!
queen victoria
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
bertie
Do you think that’s entirely appropriate?
queen victoria
I am the Empress of India. What could be more appropriate
than learning Urdu?
bertie
But in front of the entire Household –
queen victoria
You are absolutely right. I can’t have all of these
distractions. Ponsonby, I wish to go to Glassalt Shiel.
bertie

Everybody is surprised. She looks at Bertie.
queen victoria
Alone.

Queen and Abdul on the promontory.
queen victoria
Oh, to be by oneself and live a simple rudimentary
existence.
41

She turns to Abdul.
queen victoria
They don’t understand anything, those stupid aristocratic
fools. Toadying around. Jockeying for position. I’ve had this
my whole life. They couldn’t bear me bringing dear John
Brown here. Yet I have been happier here than anywhere in
the entire world. Oh, I miss him, Abdul. And Albert. It’s
been thirty years and I think about him every day. I am so
lonely, Abdul. Everyone I really loved has died. And I just
go on and on and on.
She weeps.
abdul
Oh, Your Majesty.
Abdul kneels and wipes her eyes.
queen victoria
It’s an impossible position. No one really knows what it is
like to be Queen. I am hated by millions of people – all
over the world. I have had nine children, all vain and
jealous, and completely at loggerheads with each other.
Bertie is a complete embarrassment. I have thirty-four
grandchildren, my offspring will rule most of Europe – but
look at me: a fat, lame, impotent, silly old woman. What is
the point, Abdul?
abdul
The point, Your Majesty?
queen victoria
Of life?
abdul
Service.
queen victoria
Service?!
abdul
I think we are not here to worry about ourselves. We are
here to serve a greater purpose.
42

Queen Victoria thinks about this.
abdul
In the Koran it says: we are here for the good of others.
queen victoria
The Koran?
Abdul is trying to cheer up Her Majesty with his enthusiasm.
abdul
Oh yes, I am a Hafiz. I know the Koran by heart.
queen victoria
By heart. Isn’t it very long?
abdul
There are 114 Surahs containing 6,236 verses.
queen victoria
And you know every word?
abdul
Many Muslim people know the Koran.
queen victoria
I thought you were a Hindu.
abdul
I am a Muslim, Your Majesty. I learnt the Koran from my
father. And he taught me all the great poets: Kabir, Rumi.
He is my Munshi.
queen victoria
Munshi?
abdul
Yes, Munshi. My teacher.
queen victoria
Then we would like you to be the Queen’s Munshi.
abdul
But I am a servant. A servant cannot be a Munshi?

43

queen victoria
Well, you are a servant no longer. You are my teacher. You
shall teach me Urdu and the Koran and anything else you
think of.
int. hall. balmoral. night
A dozen local guests are waiting for the dinner. Mohammed is
standing with a tray of sherry. Across the room Ponsonby, Bertie,
Miss Phipps, Lady Churchill and Dr Reid are gathered in a huddle.
bertie
What the hell is a Munshi?
ponsonby
Apparently it’s some sort of ‘spiritual teacher’, Your Royal
Highness.
bertie
Has she completely lost her mind?! She’s the head of the
Church of England, for God’s sake! What’s the Archbishop
of Canterbury going to say?
dr reid
It’s utter lunacy.
lady churchill
I say he’s ‘brown’ John Brown.
dr reid
And what’s more she’s given him my room!
miss phipps
But where have they put you, Dr Reid?
dr reid
(with a hateful look to Ponsonby)
In the tower!
Bertie suddenly sees the Queen arrive with Abdul in tow in his
magnificent Munshi garb.
bertie
Oh my God.
44

Bertie looks horrified as the Queen approaches him.
queen victoria
Good evening, Bertie.
bertie
Mother?!
Aside Mohammed whispers to Abdul.
mohammed
What the hell are you wearing?
Before Bertie can question Queen Victoria about this turn of events the
Head Waiter announces:
head waiter
Dinner is served.
int. the same, staircase
Bertie with Queen Victoria.
bertie
Lady Churchill was absolutely scandalised. A servant. And
a Hindoo to boot!
queen victoria
The Munshi is a Muslim scholar. He knows the Koran off
by heart and for your information is no longer a servant.
He is to be given a staff of his own.
bertie
This is absurd. Letters. Invitations to supper. You’re treating
him like family.
queen victoria
No, I like Abdul. Lady Churchill had better get used to the
fact – as the Munshi is coming on holiday with us as a fully
equal member of the Household.
bertie
You can’t take a Muslim to Florence!

45

queen victoria
That will be all.
The Queen walks off upstairs.
int. railway carriage. day
The train is trundling along. Mohammed blows his nose into his
handkerchief.
mohammed
A spiritual advisor!? You haven’t an idea in your head. You
promised to get us out of here. And now we’re going to
bloody Florence.
abdul
But don’t you see what a privilege it is to see the glories of
Italy with all these wonderful people?
mohammed
You complete bloody idiot. Do you really think they are
going to stand there and let her promote a wog? I did not
come here to carry your bloody cases.
abdul
What you are complaining about? We have our own
carriage. With a bathroom. They’ve a very nice bed for
you on the floor.
Mohammed blows his nose.
mohammed
I’m dying here. I want to go home. I am telling you this
whole thing is a disaster waiting to happen.
abdul
I am getting sick of your negative attitude. Life is a big
adventure. You just need to open up and enjoy it. We’re on
holiday. What on earth could possibly go wrong?
Abdul sees a rope above him – he grabs hold of it and reads the little
sign beside it.
abdul
‘Do Not Pull.’

int. queen’s carriage. train. later
The baroque splendour of the Queen’s carriage. The Queen is in bed.
Abdul is there.
abdul
I just want to apologise about the emergency brake, Your
Majesty. I hope you weren’t too badly injured.
queen victoria
It was nothing at all, Abdul. Anyway, it’s a completely
understandable mistake. I am just so glad you are with us.
What a treat to show you Florence for the first time.
Bertie emerges from the royal bathroom in his pyjamas to see Abdul.
bertie
What’s he doing here?
queen victoria
Abdul was just explaining what happened earlier.
bertie
I really don’t see why I have to share your bathroom.
queen victoria
I shared a bed with my mother until I became Queen.
bertie
Mother, I am fifty-seven years old. The Munshi’s got his
own bathroom.
abdul
Oh yes, it is a very fine bathroom indeed, Your Majesty.
bertie
Excuse me.
He has to push his way past Abdul.
bertie
Goodnight, Ma-mah.
abdul
Goodnight, Mr Bertie.

47

queen victoria
Bertie. Make sure you shut that door.
Bertie pushes past Abdul unhappily and leaves. The Queen grabs
Abdul’s hand
queen victoria
Abdul, I have something for you. To celebrate your first trip
to Florence. And becoming my Munshi. It is a locket. With
a picture of me.
She gives him a locket.
abdul
Oh Your Majesty! How can I ever thank you.
queen victoria
Keep me safe.
abdul
For ever, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Oh Abdul. You will love Florence. Such wonderful views.
int. gardens, villa palmieri. day
Abdul and Queen Victoria are walking in the Italianate gardens below
the terrace of the Villa Palmieri, Mohammed standing sentry in the
background.
queen victoria
Isn’t it glorious. Albert loved it here. The Brunelleschi
Dome. The Uffizi Gallery. He spent all of his money on
Old Masters. We collected so much I had to give most of it
to the National Gallery. He so admired the Medicis. That
they would commission the greatest artists of the day. So
they could leave something astonishing behind.
abdul
In India we also commision great artists. Each Mughal
Emperor would bring the greatest craftsmen to make great
glories for their Durbar Room.
48

queen victoria
A Durbar Room?
abdul
Oh, yes, every Emperor had a Durbar Room. Full of the
finest things known to man.
queen victoria
Well, I am the Empress of India. I should have a Durbar
Room.
abdul
A brilliant idea, Your Majesty. But where would you put it?
queen victoria
The Isle of Wight. Obviously.
Ponsonby arrives.
ponsonby
Signor Puccini has arrived, Your Majesty.
int. grand room. night
We are in the middle of the recital. The Royal Household are listening
to a fat man singing ‘Donna non vidi mai’ at the piano. Abdul is
listening intently next to the Queen, Bertie next to Lady Churchill.
Ponsonby says something to Dr Reid. The Munshi turns:
abdul
Ssshhhh!
The fat man at the piano finishes his song. Abdul applauds
enthusiastically.
queen victoria
And where did you say it was from, Mr Puccini?
puccini
It’s from my new opera Manon Lescaut. It’s about two
lovers separated by the class divide who run away together.
queen victoria
It sounds marvellous.
49

puccini
But she is imprisoned for her love, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Oh.
puccini
But they escape.
queen victoria
Bravo.
puccini
But finally she dies, leaving him utterly bereft.
queen victoria
I’m not sure we do like the sound of it. We prefer comic
opera. Do you know any Gilbert and Sullivan?
abdul
Perhaps Your Majesty will sing us a song?
queen victoria
Oh no. I couldn’t possibly.
The Household on cue:
lady churchill
But please, Your Majesty.
bertie
(aside)
God save us!
queen victoria
Well, just one. From Pinafore. Bertie.
bertie
Do I have to?
Bertie, reluctantly, goes to the piano.
queen victoria
‘Little Buttercup’. In C.
Bertie sits at the piano with immense reluctance. Queen Victoria sings
50

‘Little Buttercup’ poorly. She dries, is about to continue, but Ponsonby
prompts the applause.
abdul
Bravo! More! More!
But to everyone’s relief Puccini produces a glass of champagne and
hands it to the Queen.
puccini
Bellissimo, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
I was taught by Mendelssohn, you know.
Puccini raises his glass.
puccini
To the Queen.
queen victoria
To me.
She knocks back the champagne.
ext. terrace, florence. night
The Queen is tipsy. She holds on to Abdul’s arm as they walk along
the terrace in the warm evening air, Florence twinkling below. Bertie
and Lady Churchill look on aghast. The Queen is singing the melody
of the Gilbert and Sullivan song:
queen victoria
La, la, la, la, la, la.
She lifts her arm as she walks, half dancing.
We should not have drunk all that champagne.
She giggles.
abdul
May I?
Abdul takes the Queen’s other hand and they waltz their way along
the terrace, ‘la-la-ing’ an accompaniment.We are close up on their
51

almost childish pleasure. Finally the Queen and Abdul stumble and
come to a stop. Abdul smiling at the Queen. Still holding her.
queen victoria
Abdul, I have not been so happy for years.
abdul
When I came to England, I was terrified of you. But you
are a very kind lady. You are a very unique lady to me.
queen victoria
And you are very, very ‘unique’ to me, Abdul.
abdul
I know that you are very much older than me. And you are
the Queen of England and Empress of India and I am just
a humble Munshi. But I think you are the most special
person in my whole life.
His eyes are alight. They look at each other intimately.
abdul
Even more special than my wife.
queen victoria
(shocked)
Wife?!
abdul
Yes.
The Queen is computing this information, her face severe.
queen victoria
You are married?!
abdul
Of course.
queen victoria
But where is your wife?
abdul
In India.
queen victoria
Why didn’t you tell me you were married?
52

abdul
I didn’t think it mattered.

(severely)
Of course, this changes everything. You will have to return
to India immediately.
Abdul looks concerned.

Mohammed opens the carriage door. Abdul emerges from the carriage.
He steps down resplendent in his ceremonial outfit, double-sashed,

Mohammed, Abdul, Ahmed, Mrs Karim and the mother-in-law along
with the usual entourage, plus the retinue of the royal visitors, all
squashed tightly in Abdul’s tiny living room. Bertie and Dr Reid are
perched on travel cases because of the lack of chairs.

Abdul translates this – at great length – to his missus. She whispers
something to him – also at great length, then . . .

She says: ‘Very well. Thank you, Your Majesty.’

Her Majesty Victoria Regina of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Empress
of India, for accommodating us in this beautiful cottage.
We are extremely grateful for her infinite kindness and
interior decoration. The gift of hospitality and friendship
to strangers is of very high importance in our culture and
we are honoured to repay it in our very small way. What is
ours is yours.

Quite literally.

And this is how the world should be. Here we are,
representatives of the great nations of the world, all
snuggled together, having a nice cup of Indian tea. Thanks
be to Allah.

following close behind:
bertie
Children?!
Dr Reid is on Ponsonby’s heels.
dr reid
(aside, to Ponsonby)
If they are going to live here can I get my room back?
The Queen is the last to leave. She takes his hand:
queen victoria
Oh Abdul, I am so glad you are back – it really has been
dreadfully dull without you. And I am so glad to meet Mrs
Karim. There’s just one thing I’ve been curious about this
whole afternoon. What does Mrs Karim look like behind
her veil?
abdul
Behind her veil? You must see her.
queen victoria
Is that allowed?
abdul
Of course it is allowed. You are a lady. And the Empress
of India.
queen victoria
Really?! You think she’d let me take a glimpse?
abdul
She would be honoured, Your Majesty.
Ponsonby and Bertie at the end of the garden path.
bertie
Where the hell is she going now?

59

int. tiny living room, abdul’s cottage. day
Queen Victoria is sitting on a chair. Mrs Karim takes off her burqa.
We glimpse the gorgeous costume underneath, full of colour. Then we
see her face. Her nose is pierced with a gold chain linked to her ear.
She giggles like a schoolgirl.Victoria is transfixed.
queen victoria
Oh, you really are beautiful.
Mrs Karim giggles again, not understanding a word. The Queen
stands and takes both of her hands:
queen victoria
Tum bahut sundar ho. [You are very beautiful.]
Mrs Karim beams. Her mother watches inscrutably from her burqa.
Abdul looks on at the whole scene, proud as Punch.
queen victoria
Main tum yahaan hai bahut khush hoon. [I am so happy
to have you here.]
ext. osborne house. day
A carriage arrives. Ponsonby is waiting for Lord Salisbury, who
gets out.
lord salisbury
What on earth is a Durbar Room?
int. osborne, corridor approaching durbar room. day
The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, is marching up a corridor,
followed by his private secretary and deputy private secretary, with a
face filled with fury. Bertie and Ponsonby are running alongside.
ponsonby
It is a celebration of all things Indian inspired by the
Mughal Emperors, Prime Minister.
lord salisbury
But I don’t understand. Who gave her permission to build
this in the first place?
60

bertie
Don’t blame me. I was in Monte Carlo.
ponsonby
I’m afraid she is a law unto herself, Prime Minister.
lord salisbury
For God’s sake. She’ll be wearing a burqa next. I am
holding you entirely responsible, Ponsonby.
They have arrived at the Queen, who is waiting with Dr Reid, Lady
Churchill, Miss Phipps and the usual entourage.
queen victoria
Prime Minister, you are late.
lord salisbury
I’m terribly sorry, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Let us begin.
int. indian corridor. day
The Queen leads Salisbury, Ponsonby, Bertie, etc. down the Indian
corridor.
queen victoria
This, as you can see, is the Indian corridor. The Durbar
Room was designed by Mr Bhai Ram Singh.
They pass a smiling Mr Bhai Ram Singh.
bertie
(in Salisbury’s ear)
The place is crawling with them.
queen victoria
And we commissioned a series of portraits. Of eminent
Indians. This is Princess Gurmma.
Lord Salisbury tries to feign interest as he looks at the painting.
queen victoria
This, of course . . . is the Munshi.
61

Salisbury looks horrified at the portrait of Abdul. Then his eye falls
upon the real Abdul who is in full Munshi uniform, a flowing smock.
Abdul beams at the Prime Minister.
abdul
An honour to meet you, Mr Prime Minister, sir.
queen victoria
A very good likeness. Don’t you think?
abdul
(whispering to Lord Salisbury)
I asked him to take a few pounds off. This is my wife, Mr
Prime Minister, sir, and this is my mother-in-law.
The two ladies are by his side in their identical burqas.
At least I think that’s the right way round.
Abdul chuckles at his own joke.
And this is my servant, Mohammed.
Mohammed blows his nose. Ahmed is there.
lord salisbury
(aside to Ponsonby)
What the hell is going on here, Ponsonby?
queen victoria
And this, Prime Minister, is the Durbar Room.
int. durbar room, continuous
Salisbury follows the Queen into the Durbar Room in all its splendour.
It is a state room decorated in an over-the-top higgledy-piggle of
Mughal and Hindu motifs. Indian musicians play from the balcony.
The Queen walks through the room pointing out the carvings:
queen victoria
The carvings are all from Uttar Pradesh.
And the carpet:
The carpet was woven in a gaol in Agra. Perfect, of course,
for the tableaux.
62

At the end of the room is the Peacock Throne.
queen victoria
And the pièce de résistance. The Peacock Throne.
The Queen sits on the throne.
An exact copy of the one in Agra. And, of course, the
Koh-i-Noor!
She is wearing the Koh-i-Noor brooch.
queen victoria
Now I really do feel like the Empress of India.
She is like a little child, swinging her feet joyously. Salisbury and the
household deputation look on at her:
bertie
(aside to Dr Reid )
I thought she was supposed to be dying.
lord salisbury
It really is a remarkable addition to the house, Your
Majesty.
queen victoria
We have Abdul to thank for the whole idea.
abdul
(who is now standing next to the Queen)
Oh, really – it was nothing.
Ponsonby steps forward, very formally.
ponsonby
To celebrate the completion of the Durbar Room. A little
surprise, Your Majesty.
Mohammed appears bearing an ornately inlaid box. The Queen opens
the box and looks inside. Pulling a confused face:
queen victoria
What is it?
ponsonby
A mango, Your Majesty.
63

A general gasp. Abdul peers inside.
abdul
It’s ‘off’.
A look of horror on everyone’s face.
queen victoria
Ponsonby. This mango is off.
Ponsonby’s chagrin.
int. ladies’ dressing room, osborne house. night
Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps, and various other ladies from the
entourage in petticoats getting undressed. Helped by Mrs Tuck.
lady churchill
A line has definitively been crossed.
int. men’s dressing room. osborne house. night
Abdul is getting changed into his Sultan of Persia outfit. Mohammed
wipes his brow and sits down, shaking with a fever.
mohammed
This is a complete and utter disaster.
abdul
I don’t understand.
mohammed
They’ve been waiting for this.
abdul
Who have?
mohammed
Ponsonby, Reid. The whole damn lot of them. Don’t you
see, she’s been rubbing their noses in it but now it’s going
public. I’m telling you they’re not going to stand for it –
they’ll rise up and chop your bloody balls off. You’ve upset
the order of everything. You think they are going to lie back
and take it?
64

abdul
But I haven’t done anything.
mohammed
You stupid, bloody Uncle Tom. Don’t you see you’ve upset
the order of everything. I’m telling you this whole thing is a
complete catastrophe.
Abdul looks worried.
alick yorke
Everything alright in here?
int. durbar room. night
Now the Durbar Room has been transformed. A large stage with a
plush velvet curtain has been erected at one end and dominates the
room. The room is crammed with people ready to see the tableaux.
Bigge, Reid, Ponsonby, all the staff in the rear rows crane to see the
arrival of Mrs Karim and Mrs Karim’s mother.
The Queen raises her hand and waves at Mrs Karim.
queen victoria
Mrs Munshi! Please, sit here. Bertie.
Bertie, much put out, is forced to move. Salisbury watches the whole
thing in horror.
int. ladies’ dressing room. night
Lady Churchill puts on her a yashmak and looks in the mirror.
lady churchill
I have never been so humiliated in my entire life.
int. durbar room. night
The lights in the hall have dimmed. Music. The Queen squeezes Mrs
Karim’s hand. Alick Yorke appears from between the curtains on stage.
alick yorke
A scene in Ancient Persia.
65

He withdraws. Ponsonby pops a pill. The Queen is agog with delighted
anticipation. The curtains open to reveal painted flats. A scene from
Ancient Persia. Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps and Mrs Tuck come on
dressed in Persian costumes. They pose as a harem of supplicants. Enter
Abdul, dressed as the Sultan of Persia with Ahmed as his servant.
Mohammed is at the back sick with fever.
abdul
I am the Sultan of Persia, King of all Kings. You are now
under my power.
lady churchill
Your Highness. We bestow all the riches of the Orient upon
you.
The ladies proffer paste jewels. Abdul tries his best to look triumphantly
regal. They all look out uneasily at the audience trying to maintain a
matey rictus as the orchestra swells and they hold the tableau. Ahmed
is in the way – Abdul surreptitiously cuffs him to clear his sightline.
We notice Mohammed swaying, clearly ill, and just as the curtain
descends as everyone else is fixed in the tableau, Mohammed sneezes.
Lord Salisbury is open-mouthed. Ponsonby holds his forehead in
despair. The Queen is unabashed with her approval.
queen victoria
Bravo! Bravo the Munshi!
bertie
(aside to Dr Reid )
Now she thinks he’s Henry Irving.
As the curtain opens for the ‘call’, the Queen leaps to her feet. The
entire household follow suit, applauding politely. Only Mrs Karim and
her mother remain seated. Abdul gestures his respects to Her Majesty
and bows egregiously. She claps enthusiastically. The curtains close
again. Salisbury is not happy.
int. hallway, osborne house. night
Lord Salisbury bollocks Ponsonby.
lord salisbury
What the hell is this, Ponsonby? Munshi-mania? I’m trying
66

to keep an empire together and it looks like they’re running
the place. I want this whole sodding mess knocked on the
head or you’re finished. Understood?
Lord Salisbury turns and leaves leaving Ponsonby chagrined.
int. post-tableau room, osborne house. night
The post-tableau soirée.Victoria is sitting amongst the prominent
members of the household, drinking sherry. Ponsonby, battle-torn,
comes in to join them.
queen victoria
Ah, Ponsonby. Tell us, what exactly did the Prime Minister
say about the tableau?
ponsonby
To be entirely frank, Your Majesty, he seemed to be a little
perturbed.
queen victoria
Whatever for? He must have liked the Munshi.
ponsonby
I think the Munshi was the problem, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Really? I thought he was rather good.
ponsonby
I think he meant his position, Your Majesty. I think he
was rather alarmed he had such a prominent role in the
Household.
queen victoria
Of course Abdul has a prominent role in the household. He
is my Munshi.
ponsonby
But he’s an Indian, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
I am aware of it.

67

ponsonby
But given current sensitivities in the sub-continent, Your
Majesty. The Prime Minister was concerned it might be
‘sending the wrong message’.
queen victoria
I should have thought it was a jolly good message.
ponsonby
But he’s a Muslim, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Precisely. We owe them so much, do we not? For their role
in the Mutiny, for example.
The hubbub drops to a deathly silence.
ponsonby
The Mutiny, Your Majesty?
queen victoria
Yes. For all the help they gave us with the Hindus.
dr reid
But the Mutiny was a Muslim-led revolt, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Are you sure?
dr reid
Of course. The Muslim soldiers revolted when it was
rumoured their rifles were greased with pork fat.
queen victoria
Really?
ponsonby
The Grand Mufti, himself, put out a fatwa against you
personally. And Muslim soldiers killed over two thousand
British personnel.
bertie
Who have you been talking to, Mother?

68

Suddenly Abdul arrives with a flourish in his smartest Munshi garb.
abdul
Ta-da!
The Queen glares at him. Everyone else is staring. He realises
something is wrong.
int. sculpture corridor. osborne house. night
The Queen is standing next to Abdul in the corridor, giving him a
furious dressing down.
queen victoria
I have opened my heart to you. I have brought your family
from India, promoted you in the teeth of very considerable
opposition and disquiet from the Household. I even turned
a blind eye when you failed to tell me you were married,
which came, as you know, as quite a surprise. How could
you let me humiliate myself in front of the entire Household?
abdul
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
You said the Hindus were behind the Mutiny!
abdul
I didn’t say it was only the Hindus, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
You told me categorically that the Muslims were my
friends.
abdul
But we are your friends, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Abdul, there is a fatwa against me. It was Muslims who
started the whole thing! This is completely unacceptable.
Abdul, I thought you were outstanding as the Sultan of
Persia, but I’m afraid you will have to go home.

69

int. further along the corridor. night
Bertie, Lady Churchill and Dr Reid have gathered and are spying on
the conversation. Unable to repress his delight:
dr reid
Hallelujah!
int. osborne house. sculpture corridor
Abdul is knocked for six.
queen victoria
You have hurt my feelings very much indeed, Abdul. Don’t
you see what a position I have been put in? Thank you for
everything you’ve done for me.
She starts to leave. She turns and faces Abdul.We can see Mohammed
looking on behind her.
I will miss you a very great deal.
She turns and walks down the corridor.
Queen Victoria marches along the corridor passing Bertie, Dr Reid
and Lady Churchill, who dutifully follow her, smirking like cats that
have got the cream.
Abdul is standing devastated.We see Mohammed has been watching.
mohammed
So we’re going home.
He starts to cough.
int. sculpture corridor. night
Victoria walks along the corridor followed by the smirking Bertie, Dr
Reid and Lady Churchill. The Queen stops at the end stairs, met by
Mrs Tuck.Victoria turns to face Bertie, Reid and Churchill. They
suddenly adopt an appropriately solemn demeanour.
bertie
Goodnight, Mother.
70

queen victoria
Goodnight.
The Queen eyes them suspiciously – she knows she’s been had. They
try to keep straight faces.
int. stairs. the same
The Queen turns and struggles up the stairs. Reid’s face breaks into
a smile.
int. queen’s bedchamber. osborne house. night
The Queen on her dressing stool, unnerved. She looks up at the photo
of Abdul on her wall: Abdul standing proudly as she sits at her desk.
She thinks.
queen victoria
Mrs Tuck!
int. abdul’s cottage. night
Pouring rain. It is Mrs Tuck under an umbrella. Abdul is amazed.
ext. lane outside. night
Victoria is in her pony and trap. Abdul is standing by the trap under
an umbrella held by Mrs Tuck.
queen victoria
Abdul, you have been an utter fool and I am absolutely
furious with you. It is unconscionable that as my Munshi
you should have lied to me in any way. But also it would be
completely churlish not to recognise the considerable
kindness and devotion you’ve shown. And after all, I am
sure you thought in some way you were protecting me. But
as the monarch, I do realise nothing can really protect me.
And in that light I have decided, even though I am very
disappointed, I would like you to stay.
Abdul is astonished.
71

queen victoria
But it must never happen again.
abdul
Oh Your Gracious Majesty. How can I ever thank you?
queen victoria
Well, there is something we really must sort out, Abdul.
Abdul has no idea what she could mean.
I am deeply concerned about Mrs Karim.
int. queen’s bedroom. osborne house. day
The Queen is having breakfast in bed attended by Dr Reid, Ponsonby
and Mrs Tuck.
queen victoria
I want you to examine Mrs Karim.
dr reid
Examine Mrs Karim?!
queen victoria
Just make sure everything’s working.
ponsonby
But I thought the Munshi and his family were leaving us,
Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Whatever gave you that impression?
Astonishment from all and sundry.
The Munshi and his family are an integral part of the Royal
Household. And I would be very grateful if you gave her a
thorough examination.
She blithely goes back to work on her egg. Dr Reid looks at Ponsonby.
int. osborne house. top of stairs. day
Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid descending the stairs.
72

bertie
As far as I’m concerned this is war. We’re going to dig up
every last piece of shit the blaggard’s ever done. I want
someone in India raking through the family coals. Isn’t
your son out there, Ponsonby?
ponsonby
I couldn’t possibly be involved in subterfuge, Your Majesty.
bertie
Look. I’m going to be the one in charge very soon. You’ll
do as you’re bloody well told. I want no stone unturned.
We are going to make a dossier. Have it all down in black
and white; and put an end to this for good.
Bertie leaves. Ponsonby looks at Dr Reid.
dr reid
Well, I better go and examine Mrs Munshi.
int. cottage. day
Dr Reid is sitting awkwardly on a chair, a stethoscope round his neck,
clearly very unhappy. The Munshi’s wife is in full burqa with a veil,
sitting on the side of the bed. Her mother, also in full burqa, sits beside
her holding her hand. Dr Reid looks at Mrs Karim awkwardly, then
turns to Abdul who is waiting anxiously by the doctor’s side.
reid
I need to see her tongue.
abdul
Oh, it is not possible to uncover a lady’s mouth, Doctor.
reid
But how can I tell anything if I can’t see her tongue?
Abdul speaks to the mother-in-law in Hindi, the mother-in-law speaks
to Mrs Karim. Then she daintily lifts her yashmak a fraction and
sticks out her tongue. The doctor looks at it gingerly then it disappears
back behind the veil as quickly as it appeared.
abdul
Well?
73

reid
I think she’s fine.
int. outside mohammed’s room. day
Ponsonby and Bertie are in the servants’ corridor. Ponsonby knocks
on a door.
int. mohammed’s room. day
Bertie and Ponsonby are in Mohammed’s room. Mohammed has
declined since we last saw him.
ponsonby
Mr Mohammed. We have come here because we are not
unaware of your predicament. That you arrived in the first
place almost by accident and find yourself stuck here
through a bizarre set of circumstances – none of your own
making. It is not beneath our notice that the inclement
English weather, especially on the Solent, has been the
cause of a precipitous decline in your general health and
what’s more you continue to suffer the vast indignity of
being a servant to someone who is in many ways your
inferior, who seems to discharge his role with increasing
abuse and disregard. But it has occurred to us that we
might be able to offer you some help.
mohammed
Help?
ponsonby
Travel home, medical care, perhaps a modest pension.
In return, of course, for a little information.
mohammed
What sort of information?
ponsonby
Look, I’m not going to beat about the bush. You’ve borne
the brunt of Abdul’s appalling behaviour and that is of a
great deal of interest to a lot of people.
74

mohammed
You want me to dish the dirty?
ponsonby
In a manner of speaking.
Mohammed coughs into his handkerchief.
mohammed
What would you like me to say?
bertie
Anything really.
ponsonby
We need details. What he says, what he does.
Mohammed thinks about this.
mohammed
Abdul does what everybody else does. Looks for preferment.
‘Curries’ favour. Crawls up the stinking greasy pole of the
shitty British Empire. Making fools of you all because he is
a servant — an Indian, Muslim servant – and you are all
quaking in your boots because he’s beating you at your own
game.
bertie
No one is quaking in their boots. We are the most powerful
nation on Earth at the height of our influence.
mohammed
In that case the only way is down. So stick your stupid
British Empire up your stinky royal bottom-hole, Mr Bertie
Prince, sir. I hope he makes the whole damn thing come
tumbling down.
He coughs into his handkerchief. There is blood. Mohammed is
shocked. Ponsonby looks on in pity.
bertie
I’ll see that you die here.

75

int. osborne house. council corridor. day
Bertie and Ponsonby in a cabal with Dr Reid.
dr reid
What do you mean, he wouldn’t say anything?
ponsonby
Well . . .
bertie
The man’s a complete shit.
queen victoria
(out of shot)
Dr Reid!
The Queen comes round the corner. Suddenly Ponsonby et al. swing
round to see her with Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps et al.
queen victoria
I am not a fool. I know there is some skulduggery afoot.
Something is going on here and I am not going to stand
for it.
Ponsonby et al. look terrified.
queen victoria
Dr Reid, I asked you to get to the bottom of Mrs Karim’s
fertility issues and it seems nothing has been done.
dr reid
Well, actually, Your Majesty, it was impossible to make a
conclusive judgement for religious reasons.
queen victoria
Well, did you examine the Munshi?
dr reid
No, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Well, examine the Munshi.
The Queen heads off. Lady Churchill and Bertie hold back.

Bertie sheepishly follows. Dr Reid turns to Ponsonby.

Ponsonby and Reid knock on a bedroom door. A voice from inside.

(off)
Go away!
ponsonby
Your Royal Highness. We come with important news about
the Munshi!
int. bertie’s bedroom. osborne house. day
Bertie is now in bed with a post-coital cigar. Lady Churchill is also in
the bed. Ponsonby and Dr Reid have just explained the news.
bertie
The clap!
lady churchill
But we can’t possibly tell her. It would kill her stone dead.
bertie
Maybe it’s not such a bad idea.
ponsonby
There’s more. It appears the father, far from being an
Indian Eminent, is in fact a prison apothecary.
bertie
Are you sure?
ponsonby
I received a telegram only this afternoon from Agra. My
son visited the gaol himself. They are absolute nobodies.
Bertie takes a puff while he thinks about this.
bertie
Well, it sounds pretty conclusive to me.
int. queen’s study. osborne house. day
Bertie knocks on the door and goes in.
78

bertie
Mother, we have to see you . . .
The Queen is sitting behind a small desk, Abdul intimately by her
side. Ponsonby and Dr Reid stand nervously before her.
bertie
(looking at Abdul)
Alone.
queen victoria
I am in the middle of my Urdu lesson.
bertie
Mother, we come with very important news of a highly
personal matter.
queen victoria
I have nothing to hide from Abdul.
ponsonby
I am afraid, Your Majesty, We have news concerning the
Munshi. Proof, beyond any doubt, that Abdul Karim is a
low-born imposter, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
But the Munshi is from a noble family and a long line of
teachers.
ponsonby
The Munshi was a mere clerk in a common gaol.
She is silent.
My own son has sent word from India and has actually
spoken to the man in question.
dr reid
His family are completely uneducated. His father is a lowly
apothecary.
bertie
The Munshi didn’t even go to school, Mother. The man’s a
complete fraud. There he is, overseeing the boxes. I’m next
in line and I can’t get anywhere near them.
79

ponsonby
It is true, Your Majesty. You have been hideously duped and
ignominously misused, Your Majesty. The Munshi is a
blackguard and an arch deceiver. I am afraid Abdul and his
father are completely common.
The Queen looks horrified at the proceedings.
We have prepared a dossier.
Ponsonby flourishes the dossier and slams it on the Queen’s table. She
seems flabbergasted. She looks at the dossier. The case seems conclusive.
They stare at her with bated breath.
queen victoria
You despicable toads. Racialists! Spying?! Dossiers?!
Picking on a poor defenceless Indian. Of course they don’t
have qualifications. It’s completely different out there.
bertie
But don’t you see, Mother, he’s using his position for his
own gain.
queen victoria
And how does that make him any different to any one of
you? How dare you look down on Abdul. How dare you
defame his poor father. Bertie, I am ashamed that you are
part of this. Abdul is a loyal, wise, sympathetic human
being who has risen on his own merits. Not by endless
backstabbing or family connections. I will not have this.
Now. Repeat after me. I will be courteous to the Munshi.
She stares at Ponsonby. He looks at Abdul, then reluctantly:
ponsonby
I will be courteous to the Munshi.
queen victoria
You.
dr reid
I will be courteous to the Munshi.
queen victoria
Bertie. All of you. ‘I will be courteous to the Munshi.’
80

everyone
I will be courteous to the Munshi.
queen victoria
It has become apparent that to get any respect in the
Household one needs to be formally recognised. In which
case, Abdul, I intend to give you a knighthood in the next
honours list.
Ponsonby almost collapses.
dr reid
Enough! This is absurd. We can’t protect you from this any
further.
The Queen stares in astonishment.
The man is riddled with gonorrhoea.
Stunned silence.
queen victoria
Gonorrhoea!?
ponsonby
Yes, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Well, you’re a doctor. Why don’t you treat him?! Now get
out of my sight. All of you.
int. outside the queen’s study. osborne house. day
Abdul, Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid come out of the room. Suddenly
Dr Reid loses it and pins Abdul up against the wall.
reid
You’re killing her, you pox-ridden Indian shit.
Reid is strangling Abdul.
abdul
Doctor R—
Abdul turns puce as Reid throttles him. Ponsonby tries to wrest Abdul
from Dr Reid’s clutches.
81

ponsonby
Dr Reid! Be courteous!
Reid comes to his senses and lets go. Abdul is shaken.

The council is completely full with scores of staff and members of the

miss phipps
And a Muslim.
alick yorke
She can’t just do what she likes.
dr reid
That’s right. We are the ones who make this palace work
and we are being ignored and exploited. We have to stand
up to this wanton bullying.
bigge
Exactly. This is a usurpation of the basic tenets of
leadership.
alick yorke
There are moral standards at stake. What is this? The Year

They all laugh.
lady churchill
I propose we should rise up as a household and demand
that she retracts.

82

miss phipps
But she’s the Queen.
lady churchill
She is our sovereign. Her position is entirely based on the
implicit contract she makes with us. Who manages the
estates? Who is up at the crack of dawn preparing her
breakfast? Toadying to foreign diplomats? Eating those
interminable meals? Listening to the infernal drivel? Lords
and Ladies, the time has come to say no. We must stand
together and show her who really runs this ship.
ponsonby
But this is a palace coup.
lady churchill
It is an assertion of our inalienable rights as the aristocracy
of this country. The monarchy is not there by divine right.
ponsonby
I think it is, actually.
lady churchill
Oh shut up.
bigge
I agree. We must resist these foreign intruders, for the sake
of England, the Empire and St George.
lady churchill
I say: either she drops this preposterous insult or we will
all leave.

Hear, hear!

Unanimous assent and self-congratulation apart from:

So what should we do?
Nobody is sure.
dr reid
Somebody has to tell her.
They all suddenly look nervous.
bigge
We should make a deputation.
alick yorke
Won’t that look like a cabal?
lady churchill
I think you should go. You are the head of Household.
ponsonby
I couldn’t possibly go, it would bring the position into
disrepute.
84

alick yorke
You know her quite well, Mrs Tuck.
mrs tuck
I’m just a dresser. What about Miss Phipps?
Everyone’s attention is drawn to the skinny, mild-mannered, nervous
Lady in Waiting.
lady churchill
Brilliant. You’re the maid of honour. Exactly the person to
break the news.
Miss Phipps looks terrified.
int. council corridor. osborne house. night
Mrs Tuck fusses over Miss Phipps, making her look just so. Ponsonby,
Dr Reid and Lady Churchill are there.
ponsonby
Off you go – and don’t take no for an answer.
The poor woman is terrified. She timidly makes her way up the stairs.
She stops and looks back. Lady Churchill gives her a look of stern
admonishment. Phipps nervously carries on. Then stops again. It’s
grandma’s footsteps. Churchill ushers her on again.
int. outside the council room. night
A terrified Miss Phipps knocks meekly on the double doors.
int. queen’s study. night
Miss Phipps walks nervously across the vast room to the little table
where Queen Victoria is sitting alone at her letters. The Queen looks
up, clearly displeased to be interrupted. Miss Phipps is shaking. The
Queen stares at her full of indignant expectation.
miss phipps
Erm . . .
queen victoria
Speak up.
85

Miss Phipps tries to gather herself and stop herself collapsing.
miss phipps
Your Majesty . . .
queen victoria
Out with it, girl, we are very busy.
miss phipps
There is something I must say that . . .
She looks at the Queen, terrified.
queen victoria
What is the meaning of this? Stop shaking.
miss phipps
I have come to ask you to reconsider the elevation of . . .
of Mr Karim.
The Queen can’t quite believe her ears.
queen victoria
What did you say?
miss phipps
I have come to ask you not to give Mr Karim a knighthood,
Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Why the devil not?
miss phipps
The members of the Household demand that you abandon
your plans, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
Demand?!
miss phipps
We believe that it degrades the very concept of knighthood.
He comes from a very low family, Your Majesty. And he is
coloured.
queen victoria
Get out of my sight.
86

Miss Phipps looks like she’s beginning to crack.
queen victoria
Did you not hear me?
miss phipps
Your Majesty, I must inform you that if you refuse – the
entire Household will resign.
The Queen cannot believe her ears. She pauses for a moment. Then lets
out an earth-shattering scream of rage:
queen victoria
Treason! Treason!
She sweeps the table in anger, evicting her Fabergé egg.
int. kitchens, the same
Miss Phipps is given whisky.
int. outside the queen’s study, the same
Ponsonby, Bertie and Reid approach the Queen’s study.
int. queen’s study. day
Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid march into the room. The Queen is sitting
with Abdul. Abdul stands up and moves out of the way.
bertie
Mummy. Enough is enough. You are bringing the monarchy
into crisis. And you are humiliating yourself for no good
reason. You will drop this Munshi business forthwith. Do
you hear me?
She stares at him.
The Munshi is a servant. He is an ignorant, pox-ridden,
Indian peasant. Did you really think the Household would
countenance such an insult?
queen victoria
I will not be disobeyed.
87

bertie
No, I’ve put up with you for over fifty years. You will drop
this forthwith or . . .
queen victoria
Or? . . . Or? . . .
bertie
We will have you certified insane. And removed from office
immediately. Here are the papers. Signed by Dr Reid.
The Queen is stunned. She looks at Dr Reid, who appears terrified of
the whole situation.
queen victoria
I am eighty-one years of age. I have had nine children,
forty-two grandchildren, and almost a billion citizens. I
have rheumatism, a collapsed uterus, am morbidly obese,
deaf in one ear. I have known eleven prime ministers,
passed 2,347 pieces of legislation. I have been in office for
sixty-two years, 234 days – thus I am the longest-serving
monarch in world history. I am responsible for five
households and a staff of more than three thousand. I am
cantankerous, boring, greedy, ill-tempered, at times selfish
and myopic, metaphorically and literally. I am, perhaps,
disagreeably attached to power and should not have
smashed the Emperor of Russia’s egg. But I am anything
but insane. If the Household wish to disobey me, so be it –
let them do it face to face. I will see everyone in the Durbar
Room. At once!
She marches out past Abdul:
Where on earth did you get gonorrhoea?
int. osborne house. durbar room. day
The Durbar Room is full. The chief members of the Royal Household
are there: Ponsonby, Reid, Phipps, Lady Churchill, but so are the
pages, footmen and the maids. The Queen marches in to face them.

88

queen victoria
I understand there is some concern over my desires on
preferment. I understand that feelings have run high and
I understand that you have decided to resign rather than
withstand my decision. If any one of you would like to
tender their resignation it will be accepted without any
unfortunate consequences – but at least have the decency
to do it to my face. If anyone wishes to resign, please step
forward.
She stares at them, absolutely formidable. Nervousness. People looking
at one another. Small feints, but no one moves. Abdul is watching from
the doorway.
queen victoria
I would like to inform you that I have decided against
awarding any knighthoods at this moment.
Relief all round that she’s come to her senses.
queen victoria
Instead, you will be delighted to know I have decided to
make the Munshi a Commander of the Royal Victorian
Order as a special token of my personal esteem for his
services to the Empire. That will be all.
Ponsonby is so overcome he has to sit down. The Queen is shaking.
She walks through the middle of the crowd who part to observe their
customary obsequies. She walks out into the corridor.
int. indian corridor. osborne house. day
The Queen walks out into the corridor alone. But we see she is
faltering. Abdul sees her and runs the whole length of the corridor and
catches her in his arms. Dr Reid and Mrs Tuck arrive. Reid pushes
Abdul out of the way to get to the Queen.
dr reid
Satisfied?
Reid pushes Abdul away from the Queen. Then suddenly a shaken
Ahmed arrives.
89

ahmed
Dr Reid! Dr Reid! It’s Mr Mohammed!
ext. graveyard. day
A devastated Abdul is at Mohammed’s funeral. The Queen is with
Abdul, Mrs Karim, the mother-in-law and Ahmed. Dr Reid and
Ponsonby stand nearby out of duty to Her Majesty. Reid turns to
Ponsonby.
dr reid
One down.
Abdul stands by the grave as the others leave.
abdul
I am sorry, my friend.
Then Abdul helps lead the Queen away.
queen victoria
We need to talk.
ext. carriage. grounds of osborne house. day
After the funeral. The Queen and Abdul sit in the open carriage. The
Queen is wrapped up against the cold weather but looks very frail.
She takes Abdul’s hand.
queen victoria
I think it’s time that you went home, Abdul.
abdul
This is my home.
queen victoria
I have been short-sighted and selfish. You are a young man,
Abdul. Your whole life ahead of you.
abdul
But, Your Majesty –
queen victoria
I cannot protect you if I am not here. You must go, Abdul –
90

with your wife. The vultures are already circling. I don’t even
think I will see this year out. All these stupid ceremonies.
What is the point in them, Abdul? They will kill me.
abdul
You will live for many more years, Your Majesty.
queen victoria
No. Abdul, I am sick and weary. I can hardly see, barely
hear. The Empress of half the world and I can’t get in and
out of my own carriage.
abdul
I cannot leave you. I am your Munshi.
queen victoria
You must protect yourself. How could we have been so
blind? Forget me, Abdul. You have been a very good friend.
abdul
They can do what they like, but every day I will come and
be at your side as long as I shall live.
queen victoria
You are a silly fool, Abdul. But I adore you.
Snow falls all around them. Abdul holds the Queen’s hand.

The Queen, now ill, is wheeled along the corridor.

The Queen is now in bed unconscious, surrounded by the Household.

The Kaiser et al. walk past Abdul into the Queen’s room. The door is
closed.
int. queen’s bedchamber. osborne house. dawn
The darkened room is full. On one side of the bed is the Kaiser, on the
other is Bertie. They look at the Queen, who appears to be asleep.
Suddenly she stirs. There is a gasp in the room. She opens her eyes.
Dr Reid takes away the oxygen mask. Bertie takes her hand.
queen victoria
Abdul?
bertie
It’s me, Mummy. And your grandson, Wilhelm. The Kaiser.
She takes the Kaiser’s hand.
queen victoria
No fighting when I’m gone. Promise me. Where is my
Munshi?
bertie
Hush. Hush. Everything is fine.
queen victoria
But I need my Munshi. Where is the Munshi?
Bertie, hurt that he is not enough, gives in.

Abdul is resolutely standing by.

Don’t you dare upset her.

The crowds of dignitaries part to let Abdul through. He approaches her
sadly, and holds her hand.

Abdul?
abdul
Yes. I am here.
queen victoria
I want to talk to the Munshi alone.
dr reid
I think Your Majesty might . . .
queen victoria
I said: alone!
int. corridor. the same
The Kaiser, Bertie, the Household et al. all troop into the corridor.
int. the queen’s bedchamber. the same
The Queen has been propped up with pillows. Abdul kneels by her
bedside. Dr Reid is discreetly at the back of the room, in the shadows.
The Queen takes some oxygen then turns to Abdul.
queen victoria
When I was young I used to long for death. And now when
93

there is nothing to live for I cling on to life with every
breath. I am scared, Abdul.
abdul
Don’t be scared.
Abdul quotes a poem in Hindi. Then translates it:
queen victoria
‘Listen, little drop, give up yourself without regret
And in exchange you will gain the ocean.
Give yourself away
And in the arms of the Great Sea be secure.’
The Great poet Rumi.
She squeezes Abdul’s hand.
abdul
Prema puri hai. Hama kevala tukare kara rahe haim. ‘Love
is the whole. We are only pieces.’
queen victoria
That is very beautiful. You are a teacher, Abdul.
abdul
Everybody knows Rumi.
Allah is the teacher.
Love is the whole.
Prema puri hai.
We are only pieces.
Hama kevala tukare kara rahe haim.
queen victoria
‘Prema puri hai. Hama kevala tukare kara rahe haim.’
Alhamdulilah!
I keep thinking I am falling.
abdul
Fall. Everything will be well. You are about to go to a much
safer place.
queen victoria
To the Banquet Hall of Eternity.

94

abdul
Yes. Goodbye, my Queen.
Abdul is crying. The Queen holds on to Abdul’s hand.
queen victoria
Goodbye. Take care, my sweet son.
She starts to nod off. Dr Reid puts his hand on Abdul’s shoulder,
clearly moved.
dr reid
Let her sleep.
int. corridor
Abdul emerges still in tears. Bertie, the Kaiser, the Archbishop et al. all
look on in pity as Abdul, completely absorbed, walks away. They troop
back into the Queen’s chamber.
int. the queen’s bedchamber
Everyone has resumed their vigil. The junior serving girl yawns at the
back. Suddenly we realise the Queen’s oxygen bottle stops emitting
bubbles. Bertie has the Queen’s hand. He realises she has died.
int. corridor outside queen’s bedchamber
Abdul is waiting outside. The doors open. Bertie appears. He looks
Abdul in the eye with contempt.

Bigge, dressed immaculately in black with a top hat, walks to the gates

Bertie in the darkness of the Queen’s study. He throws open the
shutters himself, morning light floods in. He sits at the Queen’s desk –
it’s his now.

Mrs Tuck throws open the curtains as she did at the beginning of the
film. The crepuscular room is flooded with light. Maids throw off the
sheets. The Queen’s body is blanched.

Bertie looks down and sees on the desk her Urdu journals.
int. corridor outside queen’s bedchamber
Mrs Tuck comes out of the Queen’s bedchamber. She takes Abdul’s
hand and leads him into the room.
int. queen’s bedchamber
The Queen has been transformed into a transcendental vision.We see
Abdul transfixed by the dead Queen. Slowly, with great reverence, he
kneels before her.
abdul
May Allah bless you.
He kisses her feet. Finally as he raises his head we see his devastated
sadness. Then his look turns from one of devastated loss to one of
foreboding.
int. corridor, osborne house
Abdul walks out along the corridor and down the grand staircase. On
the sound track we hear the sound of violent banging on a door.

The henchmen run into the room and start ransaking the place. Mrs
Karim and her mother in full burqa try to prevent them taking things.
A henchman goes past with a drawer stuffed with letters.
ext. garden, abdul’s cottage. day
The henchmen have made a big pyre of the letters. One henchman
pours petrol on and the whole thing goes up in flames. Bertie looks on
contentedly, smoking a cigar. Mrs Karim runs out.

Abdul walking. He looks up to see smoke. He hears Mrs Karim
scream and he starts to run.

A henchman throws on more letters. Mrs Karim, screaming, is now
being restrained by a henchman. Suddenly there is a shout. Abdul
comes running into the garden.
abdul
No!
Footmen hold back the screaming Abdul as the pyre burns.
bertie
I want you out of here immediately.
Satisfied, he leaves. Mrs Karim takes Abdul’s hand.
mrs karim
They’ve taken everything.

97

She surreptitiously gives him something as the pyre burns. He looks
down. She has given him the locket. He holds it tight. The smoke of the
fire obscures everything.
int. passenger ferry, solent. misty morning
The smoke turns into mist on the Solent.We are on a ferry. Abdul and
his wife as it pulls away from shore. No one recognises Abdul. He opens
his palm to reveal the Queen’s locket. Looking back, he disappears into
the mist as the boat sails away.
int. darkened room, agra. morning
As in the beginning of the film, shutters are opened on to bright
daylight as a muezzin calls to prayers.

As before, we see a figure from behind praying. The rooftops of Agra
below, the Taj Mahal in the distance.

The bustle of an Agra street. A figure makes his way through the chaotic

We follow him from behind and see he has grey hair.We realise this is
Abdul. He makes his way determinedly through the city to a park.
ext. agra, park
Abdul makes his way to a statue of Queen Victoria. He kneels.We
think he is praying but he kisses the Queen’s feet.
abdul
Good morning, Your Majesty.

98

Abdul sits on the base of the statue. He looks out at the crowds passing
by. In his hand we see the locket – the camera slowly cranes back.
Abdul the faithful retainer has kept his word: he remains loyally with
his Queen despite everything.

We crane above the statue to see the whole vista of Agra. The Taj
Mahal glistening in the background.
