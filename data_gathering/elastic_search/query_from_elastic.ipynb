EVIL S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY                 The lair is 1960 s high-tech.  We see a huge oversized                 conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES,                 including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket                 and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic                 doctors, and the meter maid s chairs tip                 back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and                 smoking.                                       DR. EVIL                          Mustafa...

We                           must go to London.  I ve set a trap                           for Austin Powers!                 EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY                 MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.                 We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet                 pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night                 Fever.                 We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of                 Mystery.  He s a swinger, with                 medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National                 Health Services glasses.                 Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is                 that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.                 Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to                 a MOD FREAK, who s just gotten off a red double-decker bus.                 Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO                 BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all                 start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently                 to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.                 One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a                 metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears                 a see-through Mary Quant dress.                                       AUSTIN                               (taking photos)                          Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout                           for me baby.  Smashing!

Austin pulls off the mod girl s wig.  She is a MALE ASSASSIN.                  The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.                 Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin                 hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington                 kicks the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a                 head-lock from behind.                                       AUSTIN                          Where s Doctor Evil?                 ANGLE ON:  A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE                 FINGER PULLS THE TRIGGER OF A SPEAR                 gun.  The assassin falls forward.  A spear protrudes from                 his back.  Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door.                  They give chase.                 INT.  CLUB - BACK ROOM                 They enter.  Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair.                                       AUSTIN                          I ve got you again, Dr. Evil!                 The chair fills with a WHITE MIST.                                       DR. EVIL                               (unseen, through mist)                          Not this time.

Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair.                  A sign on the egg reads  CRYOGENIC                 FREEZING BEGINNING.                                        MRS. KENSINGTON                          My God!  He s freezing himself.                 Austin begins FIRING at the egg chair.  The ceiling opens up                 and the egg rises through the opening.  Everything begins to                 RUMBLE.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling.                 EXT.

He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to                 reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted                 by various miniature models.                                       NUMBER TWO                          Over the last thirty years, Virtucon                           has grown by leaps and bounds.  About                           fifteen years ago, we changed from                           volatile chemicals to the                           communication industry.  We own cable                           companies in thirty-eight states.                 The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map.

The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago.                                       NUMBER TWO                          We also own the Franklin mint, which                           makes decorative hand-painted theme                           plates for collectors.                               (holds up plate)                          Some plates, like the Gone With The                           Wind series, have gone up in value                           as much as two-hundred and forty                           percent, but, as with any investment,                           there is some risk involved.                                       DR. EVIL                          Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It s called                           blackmail.  The Royal Family of                           Britain are the wealthiest landowners                           in the world.  Either the Royal Family                           pays us an exorbitant amount of money,                           or we make it look like Prince                           Charles, the heir to the throne, has                           had an affair outside of marriage                           and, therefore, they would have to                           divorce.                 There is an uncomfortable silence.                                       NUMBER TWO                          Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did                           have an affair.  He admitted it, and                           they are now divorced, actually.                                       DR. EVIL                          People have to tell me these things.                            I ve been frozen for thirty years,                           throw me a bone here.                               (pausing)                          OK, no problem.  Here s my second                           plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a                           weather changing machine that was in                           essence a sophisticated heat beam                           which we called a  laser.   Using                           this laser, we punch a hole in the                           protective layer around                 the Earth, which we scientists call the  Ozone Layer.   Slowly                 but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the                 risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a                 hefty ransom.                 There is another uncomfortable silence.                                       NUMBER TWO                          Umm, that also has already happened.                                       DR. EVIL                          Right.                               (pause)                          Oh, hell, let s just do what we always                           do.  Let s hijack some nuclear weapons                           and hold the world hostage.                               (pause)                          Gentlemen, it s come to my attention                           that a breakaway Russian Republic                           called Kreplachistan will be                           transferring a nuclear warhead to                           the United Nations in a few days.                            Here s the plan.  We get the warhead,                           and we hold the world ransom...                               (dramatic pause)                          ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!                 There is an uncomfortable pause.                                       NUMBER TWO                          Don t you think we should ask for                           more than a million dollars?  A                           million dollars isn t that much money                           these days.                                       DR. EVIL                          All right then...                               (dramatic pause)                          ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!                 There is another uncomfortable pause.                                       NUMBER TWO                          Virtucon alone makes over nine billion                           dollars a year.                                       DR.

PATTY O BRIEN                               (quietly, straining)                          Go to hell.                 Austin drops Patty s head into the toilet and FLUSHES.  We                 hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O Brien.                 INT.  TEXAN S STALL                 The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned.                 INT.  AUSTIN S STALL                 Austin reaches into Patty O Brien s wallet.  We see his Dr.                 Evil ID card and Alotta s Virtucon business card with her                 address.                 INT.  BATHROOM                 Austin is leaving his stall.  The Texan can see Patty                 O Brien s dead body head-first in the toilet.

The charms                 come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover.  A                 second later, a blue diamond falls out.                 INT.

VANESSA                               (into phone)                          Hello Mum?                 INT.  MRS. KENSINGTON S HOUSE - LONDON                 An older Mrs. Kensington sits in her suburban English front                 room.                                       MRS.

In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is                 very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of                 flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.                                       MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

Because you managed to resist Austin                           Power s charms.                 Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.                  Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number                 Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.                                       VANESSA                          Well, God knows he tried, but I ve                           been rather firm with him, Mummy.                            You didn t tell me he was so obsessed                           with sex.  It s bizarre.                                       MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)                          You can t judge him by modern                           standards.  He s very much a product                           of his times.  In my day he could                           have any woman he wanted.                                       VANESSA                          What about his teeth?

He has cut one piece to the point                 to which it s a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it                 to her.

If the                           world doesn t pay up in four days,                           he s threatening to destroy the world.                                       AUSTIN                          Thank you, Exposition.  Only two                           things, scare me, and one is nuclear                           war.

It s one thing to                           have a warhead, it s quite another                           thing to have the missiles to launch                           it.

BASIL EXPOSITION                          My God, Austin, what have you done?

VANESSA                          Austin, have you gone mad?                 The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.                                       MRS.

No offense, but if that s a woman,                           it looks like she s been beaten with                           an ugly stick.

I mean, I                 don t want to sound paranoid, but I ve had some bad                 relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.                  You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to                 give into these insecurities, but I can t help but feel this                 weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.

Alotta                           meant nothing to me.                                       VANESSA                               (pause)                          Well, it means something to me.

ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a                 list of names crossed out, with                 comments written in beside them.

He picks up his new pair&emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER                 PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.                 Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We                 see the CDs he s just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER S                 and BURT BACHARACH S GREATEST HITS.                 Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened                 Campbell s Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It                 explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.                 He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The                 NOISE is awful.                 Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head                 ripped off, and blood spews out.                 Austin is genuinely frightened by this.                 INT.

It is                 emotionally charged.  A lot of pained expressions and coffee                 in Styrofoam cups.                                       SON 1                               (crying)                          I love you, Dad.                                       DAD 1                          I love you, Son.                 They hug.

EVIL                          Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.                                       GROUP                          Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.                                       SCOTT EVIL                               (into it)                          Hello, everybody.                                       THERAPIST                          So, Scott, why don t we start with                           you.  Why are you here?                                       SCOTT EVIL                          Well, it s kind of weird.                                       THERAPIST                          We don t judge here.                                       SCOTT EVIL                          OK.  Well, I just really met my Dad                           for the first time three days ago.                            He was partially frozen for thirty                           years.  I never knew him growing up.                            He comes back and now he wants me to                           take over the family business.                                       THERAPIST                          And how do you feel about that?                                       SCOTT EVIL                          I don t wanna take over the family                           business.                                       DR. EVIL                          But Scott, who s going to take over                           the world when I die?                                       SCOTT EVIL                          Not me.                                       THERAPIST                          What do you want to do, Scott?                                       SCOTT EVIL                          I don t know.  I was thinking, maybe                           I d be a vet or something, cause I                           like animals and stuff.                                       DR. EVIL                          An evil vet?                                       SCOTT EVIL                          No.  Maybe, like, work in a petting                           zoo or something.                                       DR. EVIL                          An evil petting zoo?                                       SCOTT EVIL                               (shouting)                          You always do that!                               (calm)                          Anyways, this is really hard, because,                           you know, my Dad is really evil.                                       THERAPIST                          We don t label people here, Scott.                                       SCOTT EVIL                          No, he s really evil.                                       THERAPIST                          Scott.                                       DR. EVIL                          No, the boy s right.  I really am                           evil.                                       THERAPIST                          Don t be so hard on yourself.  You re                           here, that s what s important.  A                           journey of a thousand miles begins                           with one step.                                       SCOTT EVIL                          I just think, like, he hates me.  I                           really think he wants to kill me.                                       THERAPIST                          OK, Scott, no one really wants to                            kill  anyone here.  They say it,                           but they don t mean it.                 The group LAUGHS.                                       DR. EVIL                          Actually, the boy s quite astute.  I                           am trying to kill him.  My Evil                           Associates have cautioned against                           it, so here he is, unfortunately,                           alive.                                       THERAPIST                          We ve heard from Scott, now let s                           hear from you.                                       DR. EVIL                          The details of my life are quite                           inconsequential.                                       THERAPIST                          That s not true, Doctor.  Please,                           tell us about your childhood.                                       GROUP                          Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.                                       DR. EVIL                          Very well, where should I begin?  My                           father was a relentlessly self-                          improving boulangerie owner from                           Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy                           and a penchant for buggery.  My mother                           was a fifteen-year-old French                           prostitute named Chloe with webbed                           feet.  My father would womanize, he                           would drink, he would make outrageous                           claims, like he invented the question                           mark.  Sometimes he would accuse                           chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of                           general malaise that only the genius                           possess and the insane lament.  My                           childhood was typical.                 Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we d make                 meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap                 bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the                 age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the                 age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically                 shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn                 scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical                 school.  From there...                 ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

Sometimes in the course of my work                           to save the world I have to shag                           some crumpet.  It s all part of the                           job.

TOUR GUIDE                          Coming up on the left, we have the                           Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide                           range of Virtucon licensed products.                            On the right, you ll notice a door                           that leads to a restricted area.                            Only authorized personnel are allowed                           beyond that point.                 INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA                 All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a                 SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the  RESTRICTED AREA  with                 a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear                 Virtucon coveralls.                                       AUSTIN                          I ll take him, you take her.                 The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men s room;                 the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin                 and Vanessa follow.                 We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING                 KNOCKED OUT.                 Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists  coveralls                 over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.                   They go through the doors into the restricted area.                 INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA                 They approach the security GUARD.                                       VANESSA                          Austin, we don t look anything like                           our photo badges.                                       AUSTIN                          Don t worry, baby.  I picked up a                           mind control technique during my                           travels to India.  I learned it from                           my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a                           chaste man who mysteriously died of                           a disease that had all the hallmarks                           of syphilis.                 Just watch me.  Watch me, now.                 They reach the guard.                                       GUARD                          Hi, folks.

AUSTIN                          Sure.                 They flash their security badges to the guard.                 ANGLE ON AUSTIN.

Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked  PROJECT VULCAN -                 TOP SECRET.   They walk through.                 INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM                 Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits                 surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.                                       SCIENTIST                          This is the strongest, sharpest drill                           bit ever produced by man.  It weighs                           fifteen metric tones and can bore                           through a mile-thick bedrock of solid                           granite in seven seconds.                 INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM                 A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count.  They                 notice Austin and Vanessa s empty seats on the tram.  The                 guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.                 INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM                 SFX:  ALARM GOES OFF                                       ANNOUNCER                               (on PA)                          Attention, there are intruders in                           the complex.                 All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin                 and Vanessa.                                       SCIENTIST                          Get them!                 The scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold                 with judo chops.                                       AUSTIN                          Judo chop!  Judo chop!                 Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.                  SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin                 and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads                  VIRTUCON                 STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY.                  INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY                 It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a                 large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test                 track very slowly.                 Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving                 steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin                 fanning out in a search.                                       AUSTIN                          Our only way out of here is to drive                           out!                 They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER,                 push him off, and assume the controls.                                       P.A. (O.S.)                          There they are!                 Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.                  Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.                  Austin punches the other one off.                                       AUSTIN                          Hang on!  I m going to floor it!                 He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.                 TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They                 are acting like they re frozen, ad if in the headlights of a                 fast-approaching car.                                       GUARD                          Noooooooooooooo!                                       AUSTIN                          Where did you learn to shoot?                                       VANESSA                          Where did you learn to drive?                 ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY                 AS IF  IN THE NICK OF TIME.   THE                 steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still                 frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.                                       GUARD                          Noooooooooooooo!                                       VANESSA                          Austin, watch out!                                       AUSTIN                               (looking around)                          Where?  Where?                 ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE                 STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS                 away.                                       GUARD                          Noooooooooooooo!                 ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING                 THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO                 downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along                 with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks.                 ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE                 STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF                 blood and guts.                 By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run                 out into the hallway.                 INT.  HALLWAY                 The coast is clear.                                       VANESSA                          Thank God, Austin, we made it.

From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is                 Random Task flanked by four SECURITY                 GUARDS.                 INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY                 We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood                 and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns                 to reveal  Steamroller Accident Response Team  written on                 his jumpsuit.                 Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and                 dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled                 Army guy s ID tag, which reads  STEVE HARWIN.                  EXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES                 It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We                 hear a PHONE RINGING.                 INT.

TANK AREA                 Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They                 can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.                                       VANESSA                          What s your plan?                 Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing                 Austin.                                       AUSTIN                          First, I plan to soil myself.  Then,                           I plan to regroup and think about                           the next move.  Any thoughts?                                       VANESSA                          Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep                           this on me just in case.                 She pulls out a container of dental floss.                                       AUSTIN                          All right, I get it.  I have bad                           teeth.  You have to understand, in                           Britain in the Sixties you could be                           a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.                            It didn t matter.                                       VANESSA                          No, no, no.  We ll use the floss to                           get to the ledge.                                       AUSTIN                          Smashing idea!  Give it to me.                 Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental                 floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.                  He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches                 like a grappling hook.                 Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.                  Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the                 sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the                 floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.                 More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally,                 the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the                 pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his                 hand like a surgeon&emdash;                 Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile                 the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the                 open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES                 at the guard loudly.  He turns around.                                       AUSTIN                          Judo chop!                 Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of                 toothpaste into the guard s eyes.                                       GUARD                               (screaming, rubbing                                his eyes)                          My eyes!  My eyes!                 Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing                 both ends.                                       AUSTIN                          Hold on, Vanessa!                 She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety                 right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.                  Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared                 all over his face.                 He and Austin STRUGGLE.                 The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin s                 head dangling over the water.  SEA                 BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin s                 head.                                       VANESSA                               (shouting)                          Austin, watch out!                 Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard s                 head off like a blender.

MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive                 dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches                 out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his                 mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.                 He throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands                 perfectly in a different Fembot s mouth.  Austin smokes the                 remaining cigarette.                 Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are                 aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest,                 and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.                 She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and                 forth like in Jacob s Ladder.                 Eventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down                 to his Union Jack bikini briefs and                 turns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.                 He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.                  Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his                 bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.                 He mouths  I love you  to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.                  He does the  I ll call you  hand signal to yet another Fembot,                 whose head explodes.                 Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.                  Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining                 Fembots.                                       AUSITN                          Oh, I fell over.

Austin sees him and goes to shoot                 him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off                 his SHOE.                 Austin makes his way across the room to the button.                 Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.                 ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR                 The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.

He stands                 there, menacing, missing one shoe.                 Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin                 is a Big Gulp.                                       AUSTIN                          Care for a drink?                 Austin throws the drink at Random Task s feet.  It lands in                 front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels                 through the Big Gulp, up Random Task s wet sock, ELECTROCUTING                 him.                 He begins to SMOKE, and then dies.                                       AUSTIN                          Shocking.

We re not so                           different, you and I.  It s true,                           you re British, and I m Belgian.                            You have a full head of hair, mine                           is slightly receding.  You re thin,                           I m about forty pounds overweight.                            OK, we are different, I m not making                           a very good point.  However, isn t                           it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very                           things you stand for&emdash; swinging,                           free love, parties, distrust of                           authority- are all now, in the                           Nineties, considered to                 be...evil?

We were innocent,                           man.  If we d known the consequences                           of our sexual liberation, we would                           have done things differently, but                           the spirit would have remained the                           same.

The DOOR BUSTS OPEN and a half dozen gun wielding BROTHERS           crowd into the tiny room.                       otal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed           in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else s           head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming.           The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of           bloody violence.                      Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice.                                           ORLANDO                      THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!

ORLANDO (CONT D)                      Now Chevy here has something he would                      like to discuss. So we are going to                      discuss it. In a civilized manner.                      Chevy? I believe you had a question, or                      some point you were trying to make?                                           CHEV                      Where s Verona.                                          ORLANDO                      OK.

CHEV                          (starting to lose it again)                      You pulled the Anselmo job together,                      don t try to bullshit me ...                      He presses closer to ORLANDO ... the BROTHERS bristle ... the           situation is close to blowing up again.

How discussion can lead to                     clarity?                       HEV is running out of patience.                                          ORLANDO (CONT D)                     Clearly you are operating under a false                     pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did                     not  pull the Anselmo job together.  In                     fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the                     Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes                     me seventy five hunna dollars.                                          CHEV                     That s not how I heard it.                                          ORLANDO                     But that s the way it is. That s the way                     it is. So you see, I don t know where                     Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where                     he is, I would probably be there right                     now, beating his Gucci ass down.           S            tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying           ORLANDO S eyes, evaluating.                       hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he s           telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.                                           CHEV                     Alright.                      The room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter           amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit           away, crazy bitch ass mother ...                                          ORLANDO                     Thank you. That s what I m talking                     about. That resembles civility.                      LUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB                      CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though           he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds           him up and shoves him away.                                          ORLANDO (CONT D)                     Shit dude, what s the matter with you?

You ve made that                     point abundantly clear to all of us.                      He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of           the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.

CHEV shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens,           tosses it into the sink. He s visibly fading.                      ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little           plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The           bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.           CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the           floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.                      CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it           right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The           BROTHERS find this hilarious.                      ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.                                          ORLANDO (CONT D)                     Chevy ... come on, man...                      We hear CHEV S heart rate start to build, increase in volume.                      Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls,           steadies himself. A new man.                                          CHEV                     OK, that s good.

DOMINICAN in his late 40s.                           The CAMERA continues its move back, skimming over blue water,                revealing an elaborate pool area on the rooftop. CARLITO is                sitting by the pool in a velvet robe.

Still in the same shot, pulling back, CARLITO puts down the           cigar, stands up and dives into the pool. The camera drops           down below the water level, and CARLITO swims right up to it           for a CLOSE-UP.                      CARLITO S POV - We are under water swimming towards the edge           of the pool. As we look up, we see a water-distorted figure           above the water, looking down into the pool. The classic           shot made famous in The GRADUATE and used a thousand times           since ... only this time the guy outside the pool JUMPS IN.           I            t s CHEV, fully dressed. He meets CARLITO face to face           underwater and points up with his index finger.                      We CUT TO CARLITO S reaction.       He follows CHEV up.                       heir heads rise just above the water, like heads on a           platter. Several jittery BODYGUARDS stand at the edge of the           pool, guns drawn. With a simple motion of his hand, CARLITO           calms them.                                               CARLITO                        Chevy.

He passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous                BUTCHER KNIFE.                           Turning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly                closed. He advances.                           The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings                the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and                tries to peer around it into the alley.                           Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the                BUTCHER KNIFE.                            efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and                neatly cuts off ALEX S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun                and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and                into the alley.

He tries to talk, or scream, but all that                comes out is a wheezing sound. CHEV follows him out into the                alley, brandishing the BUTCHER KNIFE, heartrate slamming.

HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and           lands on him with his full weight.                      CHEV is pinned. ALEX, enraged, attempts with some success to           strangle him with his remaining hand. CHEV struggles in           futility, heart hammering. It seems hopeless ...                      ... until KAYLO appears behind ALEX with a ROLLING PIN and           brings it down on his skull with a LOUD CRACK.

HEV picks up ALEX S disconnected hand, which is still           clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He           uses ALEX S finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him           away. ALEX hits the ground with a THUD.

He picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets                out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes                him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him.

CAR HORNS BLARE as motorists attempt to warn the COP, who                flinches and whips around at the noise - but it s too late:                CHEV has the gun.                           He begins to hop around maniacally, taunting the COP, as                everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic                snarl, SLAMMING INTO FENDERS, driving up onto the sidewalk,                etc.                                                  CHEV                                 (tossing the gun up and                                  catching it)                             You want it? You want this?                            he COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but                jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up                like a fetch stick, gluing the COP S eyes, then flings it 40                feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain.                            he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV                dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He                kicks up the stand and REVS IT.                                                  COP                             You son of a bitch!                           The COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as                the bike jerks forward.                            HEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on,                dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like                buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT,                kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then                jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing,                dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails                out.

It s all cats and incense,                warm natural light, a scratchy Van Morrison LP playing on a                real record player.                            VE, in a cotton nightgown, is in the kitchen, attempting                some bit of microwave programming, punching random buttons                and getting herself worked up.                                     E                                        VE                                 (to the microwave)                             I hate you ...

EVE (CONT D)                             ... calm down, what the hell ...                           It s CHEV. He s dressed in a blue Adidas JOGGING SUIT - long                sleeve jacket, warm up pants with buttons down the side, the                works. He couldn t look more out of place in EVE S mellow                apartment. He s bathed in sweat, wild-eyed, hair slicked                back like GORDON GEKKO.                                                    EVE (CONT D)                             Oh.   My.

She accepts the kiss           gratefully enough with her mouth, but holds both hands out to           her sides as if touching the JOGGING SUIT would kill her.                      Without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into           the apartment, looking around everywhere, paranoid.                                             EVE                        Is this your new look or something?                                             CHEV                        That s right.

He checks into the bedroom, satisfies himself that it s           empty.                                             EVE                        Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

Don t be                        such a freak.                      CHEV goes to the window, peaks through the curtains.                                             EVE (CONT D)                        Actually, I m glad you re here. Can you                        change the clock on the microwave?

He peeks out the kitchen window,           looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up           and punches two buttons.                      EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the           clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18-           wheeler being dragged on it s side through a cathedral.                       HEV S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head           pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up.

He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an           old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting           to smoke.                      He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND           PRESSES THE THING CLOSED.                       OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE.                       e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in           agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out           his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping           up and down.                                          EVE (O.S.)

No! ... thanks ...                      The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it           out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a           ribbon in her hair.

HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the                window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better                look.

EVE stops suddenly in front of her door - CHEV practically                PILES into her.

EVE                              I had to see if you were telling the                              truth... oh, and you have my purse.                            CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off                 and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks                 cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire                 escape.

OK, now come on.                      EVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was           avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs           her hand and yanks her along.                      He spots EVE S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and           they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND           RICOCHET off the pavement.                      EVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV           assumes she s looking for the CAR KEYS.

CHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a           few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out           onto the ground.                       o keys.

She looks like she s about to wander around, gathering up her           things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER           WINDOW of the car.                      CHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD           FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs           around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT.

He           grabs the back of EVE S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP -           just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out           the front.

CARLITO squirts a little of the MILKY LIQUID.                                          CHEV                     Is that what I think it is?

In a flash, CHEV WHIPS OUT A GUN - everyone FLINCHES... but           no, wait: he s just holding out his fist, pointing the STICK-           EM-UP FINGER right between CARLITO S eyes.                                          CHEV                     Not so fast, motherfucker.                      For a beat, no one knows quite how to react. VERONA chuckles           nervously.

VERONA shrugs it off with less than 100% confidence...           the room EXHALES.

A GOON makes a move for CHEV... but CHEV spins on him,           leveling the finger at the GOON S forehead, and pulls the            trigger ...

He s got an ASIAN           GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking,           silenced   GLOCK .9mm.                      More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking           position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed           for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes           are dead-blank COLD AS HELL.

One of CARLITO S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is           FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of           ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another           of CARLITO S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.                      CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his           GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the           bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets...                      VERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV...                       ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks           the table forward, pinning VERONA S legs to the bench - the           ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV S lap...                       e snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at           VERONA S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS... VERONA bobbles           the .357... it hits the ground - GOES OFF - and the four           fingers of VERONA S right hand are VAPORIZED.                      VERONA SHRIEKS like a ten year old girl at a JUSTIN           TIMBERLAKE concert.                      Behind the bar, CARLITO quickly punches up his cell phone.                                            CARLITO                       Get me out of here! NOW!                      EXT.

INT SMOKING LOUNGE, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS                      CARLITO S and DON KIM S MEN have backed into opposite corners           of the room, and are firing back and forth.                      VERONA crawls along the floor, gathering up what s left of           his fingers... comes across a SYRINGE and grabs it in his           teeth like a PIRATE S KNIFE.                      DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.                                          CARLITO                         (from behind the bar)                     I ll kill you for this, Chelios!                                            CHEV                     Too late!                      CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and           pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA S           FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires -           blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers.                      An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the           BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO.                      CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265           pounder - from behind...                                            CARLITO                     Get down!                      He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of           the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.                                          GOON                     Thanks, boss.                      BOOM!                      The BIG GOON S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both           up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne,           pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then           drops back down with a THUD...

By far                the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,                powerful, ignoring the hell around them.

DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw                and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is                terrified.

Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves                his jaw as if to see if it s broken.  Miller pats him on the                cheek and moves on to the bow.

Miller glances around, sees that none                of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it                belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his                eyes back to the objective.                 THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH                 The six surviving boats alongside.

Starts climbing with the first                          group.                                       THE CLIFF FACE                          The Americans swarm up the ropes.                          Taking turns firing up at the Germans.                 MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER                 A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.                Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs                on.                                       HALF-WAY                          An American private is HIT.  FALLS,                          taking two others with him.  All                          three land on the rocks below.                          Another way to die.                                       NEAR THE TOP                          Less steep.  They leave the ropes.                          Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.                                       MILLER                          Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.                          Others bottleneck behind them.  Miller                          scans the route and the defenders.                 Sees an open gap.  Deadly.  Beyond is a protective overhang.                With a clear line to the top.                                       MILLER                          That s the route.                 Miller motions to six men huddled near him.                                       MILLER                          Go!                                       THE SIX MEN                          Take an instant to get ready.  Then                          SCRAMBLE into the gap.                 MILLER AND THE OTHERS                 Do their best to cover them.  POUR FIRE up at the Germans.                Bad angle.  No Germans are hit.                                       THE SIX MEN                          Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN                          FIRE.  All KILLED.  They fall to the                          rocks below.                 SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller s right arm and                best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.                 Sarge That s a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.                                       MILLER                          It s the only way.                                       MILLER                          Turns to the next half-dozen men.                                       MILLER                          YOU RE NEXT!                                       THE SECOND SIX                          Move to the head of the gap.  Miller                          moves for a better angle against the                          machine guns.  Calls to JACKSON, a                          tall, gangly Southern country boy,                          sharp-shooter.                                       MILLER                          JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,                          WILL YOU?                                       JACKSON                               (heavy Southern accent)                          You betcha, Captain.                 Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.                Turns to the second six.                                       MILLER                          GO!                                       THE SECOND SIX                          Take deep breaths.  Head into the                          gap.                 MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE                 JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.                SARGE gets one.  Not enough.                                       THE SECOND SIX                          Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are                          KILLED.                                       MILLER                          Turns, looking for the next six.                          His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN                          who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.                          Reiben smiles.                                       REIBEN                               (heavy Brooklyn accent)                          Captain, can I put in for a transfer?                                       MILLER                          Sure, meet me at the top, we ll start                          the paperwork.                                       THE THIRD SIX                          Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller                          exchange a look.  They both see the                          madness of what they re doing.                 MILLER AND THE OTHERS                 OPEN UP on the Germans.                                       MILLER                          GO!                                       SARGE                          Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.                          Scrambles into the gap.  The other                          five right behind.                                       IN THE GAP                          BULLETS EVERYWHERE.                 Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce                down.  EXPLODE below.                 THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller                sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.                 A perfect target.  Captain s bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING                TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.                 THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER                 SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He                swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward                Miller.                 A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he s an instant                from death.                 SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE                 Under the overhang to safety.                 MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL                IS BLOWN OFF.                 UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.                                       REIBEN                          I ll be Goddamned!  I m not dead!                 Sarge hollers back to Miller.                                       SARGE                          CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO                          THAT, SHE D BE VERY UPSET!                                       MILLER                          I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.                 Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.                HIT more Germans.                 SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop                near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw                long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.                 THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.                 Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.                                       MILLER                          Crosses the gap.  His men follow.                                       AT THE CREST                          The Americans swarm over the top.                          FIRING.                 TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.                 Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans                are CUT DOWN.                 MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man                who s struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel                charges.                                       MILLER                          Okay, Wade, your turn.                 Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.                 Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to                the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.                Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED                EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.                                       MILLER AND SARGE                          Survey the field.                                       SARGE                          What the hell were you doing?  Drawing                          fire!                                       MILLER                          Worked, didn t it?                                       SARGE                          You tryin  to get yourself killed?                                       MILLER                          Don t need to, the Krauts go that                          covered.                 Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff                at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering                the rocks and the beach below.  He s clearly affected.                 Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves                on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German                bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE                surround him.  DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                 The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of                CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands                in the heart of Washington, D.C.                                       SUPERIMPOSITION:                          WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.                 JUNE 8, 1944                 INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY                 Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,                quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.                                       A CLERK                          Older than the others, sad-eyed,                          adds a sheet of paper to a large                          pile in his out-box.                                       CLOSE SHOT                          An outgoing telegram.  It reads:                           We regret to inform you...killed in                          action...heroic service...   This is                          the paperwork of death.                                       THE CLERK                          Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds                          something troubling.  Quickly shuffles                          through some other papers.  Finds                          what he s looking for.  Rises from                          his desk and hurries out of the                          office.                 INT. LIEUTENANT S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY                 Seen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG                LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.                He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the                office with the clerk on his heels.                 INT. CAPTAIN S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY                 Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks                to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly                bothered by what he s being told.  The Captain takes the                papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.                 INT. COLONEL S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY                 A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The                walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex                deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of                ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly                hasn t slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff                officer, walks in.                 Young captain Colonel, I ve got something you should know                about.                 One-armed colonel Yes?                 Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha                Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother                was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this                morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams                this afternoon.                 The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear                and freeze.                 One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.                 Young captain There s more.  There s a fourth brother.  The                youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First                Airborne the night before the invasion.  He s on the front.                 One-armed colonel Is he alive?                 Young captain We don t know.                 The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly                to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.                 The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly                to the Captain.                 One-armed colonel Come with me.                 The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his                heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.                 EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY                 A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising                behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.                 EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY                 A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as                far as the eye can see.                                       IN THE YARD                          A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed                          to the barn over a dirt basketball                          court.                                       A PORCH SWING                          Sits empty.  Moves slightly.                 ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR                 Four American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service.                                       MARGARET RYAN                          Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face                          shows the lines of a life of hard                          work and mother hood.  A good woman.                 She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the                fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind                the black car.                 She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her                house.  She starts to grow uneasy.                 As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She                reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.                 The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,                one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.                 INT. GENERAL MARSHALL S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY                 Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.                GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to                his conference table, reading the Ryan brother  files.  Half-                a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and                the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the                file.                                       GENERAL MARSHALL                               (softly)                          Goddamn it.                 One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company                in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan                brothers died on the Juneau.                                       GENERAL MARSHALL                          Any contact with the fourth brother,                          James?                 One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles                inland, near Ramelle.  That s still deep behind German lines.                 General Marshall hardens.                                       GENERAL MARSHALL                          Well, if he s alive, we re going to                          send someone to get him the hell out                          of there.  That s just what the                          General s staff wanted to hear.                 EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY                 NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.                Miller s Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force                of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the                craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in                the distance.

He surfaces, sees                          Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a                          horrific smell.  Their conversation                          is repeatedly broken by FIRING And                          DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.                                       MILLER                          Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we                          swimming in?                                       REIBEN                          Shit, sir.                                       SARGE                          Fertilizer, Captain, I think we re                          in a cranberry bog.

MILLER                          Look at the bright side, the Krauts                          sure as hell don t want to advance                          and hold this cesspool.                 Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.                                       MILLER                          Get Fire Control, we need some                          artillery...                 Radioman Trying, sir.                 MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben s worried.                                       REIBEN                          Sir, what if they send some other                          company into Caen ahead of us while                          we re pinned down here?                                       MILLER                          Don t worry, we re the only Rangers                          this side of the continent, we ve                          got to be first into Caen.                                       SARGE                          Who cares?                                       REIBEN                          I care.  Don t you know what Caen s                          famous for, Sarge?                                       SARGE                          Frogs?

Miller, Sarge                and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German                positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck                down again.                                       REIBEN                          So, you ever heard of employee                          discounts?

MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.                                       REIBEN                          Just picture some French number been                          spending all day, every day, making                          cream-colored, shear-body negligees                          with gentle-lift silk cups and                          gathered empire waists, what the                          hell you think she wears at night?                                       MILLER                          Reiben, how the hell do you know so                          much about lingerie?                                       REIBEN                          Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother s                          got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in                          it, from the time I could crawl, we                          carry Caen lingerie, it s the best                          there is, it s all I been thinking                          about since the invasion.                 Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS                HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.                                       MILLER                          There s a war on, good chance they re                          not still making lingerie in Caen.                                       REIBEN                          Oh, Captain, they ll always make                          lingerie, it s one of the three basic                          needs of man -- food, shelter, silk                          teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.                                       REIBEN                          Happy to, sir.                 Radioman Captain, I ve got Command, they want you back at                H.Q., right away.                                       MILLER                          Maybe the war s over.                 A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops                falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben                looks dubiously at Miller.                                       REIBEN                          I don t think so, Captain.                                       MILLER                               (to Radioman)                          Stay at it until you get fire control.                               (to Sarge)                          Keep  em down, wait for the navy.                                       SARGE                          Yes, sir.                 Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles                out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.                 EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY                 Chaos.  Under fire.  INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN                SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.                                       MILLER                          Runs over the broken ground and makes                          it to the sandbagged H.Q.  He stumbles                          down the make-shift stairs.                 INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY                 Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which                continue through the scene.  Miller salutes a Major.                                       MILLER                          Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.                 Major Go on in.                 Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a                dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.                Very busy.  A field map dominates the center of the small                space.                 The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him                respectfully.  He s clearly someone special.                 COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.                He s about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of                the storm.  He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.                                       COLONEL ANDERSON                               (into field-phone)                          ...I understand your problem, but if                          we don t get those tanks off-loaded                          by 0600, we re going to have an entire                          division up at Caen with its ass                          hanging out of its pants...                 A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of                paper.                 Lieutenant Captain, here s your company address list.

MILLER HESITATES, THEN:                                       MILLER                          Respectfully, sir, sending men all                          the way up to Ramelle to save one                          private doesn t make a fucking,                          goddamned bit of sense.                               (beat)                          Sir.                 The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel                Anderson glares at Miller.                                       COLONEL ANDERSON                          You think just because you hold the                          Congressional Medal of Honor, you                          can say any damn thing you please to                          your superior officers?                 Miller considers the question, then smiles.                                       MILLER                          Yes, sir, more or less.                 Colonel Anderson looks as if he s about to bit Miller s head                off, then he smiles, too.                                       COLONEL ANDERSON                          Alright, I ll give you that.                          Continue.                                       MILLER                          The numbers don t make sense, sir.                          His brothers are dead, that s too                          bad, but they re out of the equation.                          Sending men up there is bleeding                          heart crapola from three thousand                          miles away.  One private is simply                          not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson                          This one is.  He s worth a lot more                          than that.  Which is why I m sending                          you, you re the best field officer                          there is.                 Miller Shrugs.                                       MILLER                          Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?                          Fine officer, regular church goer,                          writes poetry, he might like a mission                          like this.                               (beat)                          And he s taller than me.                 Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it s                time to get back to business.                                       COLONEL ANDERSON                          That s enough, Captain, you have                          your orders.  Major Thomas will fill                          you in.                 Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes.                                       MILLER                          Yes, sir.                 Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.                                       COLONEL ANDERSON                          Good luck, John.                                       MILLER                          Thank you, sir.                 Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.                Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices                the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they                go back to work.                 EXT.

He sees his                          men and walks toward them.  Reiben                          hurries up to Miller, pleading.

Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam                of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson                and Wade are crammed in the back.                 The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL                GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his                huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.                                       GENERAL GAVIN                          SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY                          GODDAMNED JEEP!?                 The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns                to take his lumps.                 EXT. ROAD - DAY                 Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American                staging area.                                       MILLER                          We ve got to make one stop.                 Miller points the way for Sarge.                 EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY                 Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly                white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles                and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.                SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out.                                       MILLER                          Wait here.                 He strides into the tent.                 INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY                 Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious                nerds the day before finals.  They re breaking down and                gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,                detailed work.                 One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,                patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick                glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT                EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.                Miller strides in.  Miller I m looking for Corporal Upham.                 Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.                 Upham Sir, I m Upham.                                       MILLER                          I understand you speak French and                          German.                 Upham Yes, sir.                                       MILLER                          Do you have an accent?                 Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a                touch of the Bavarian.                                       MILLER                          Good, you ve been re-assigned to me,                          we re going to Ramelle.                 Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.                 Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.                                       MILLER                          That s my understanding.                 Upham Lots of them.                                       MILLER                          Do you have a problem with that,                          Corporal?                 Upham Sir, I ve never been in combat.  I make maps.  I                translate.                                       MILLER                          I need a translator, all mine have                          been killed.                 Upham But, sir, I haven t held a gun since basic training.                                       MILLER                          It ll come back to you.  Get your                          gear.                 Upham hesitates.                 Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?                 Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he s joking.                 Upham I m writing a book and I...                 Miller s expression gives him his answer.                 Upham Uh, how about a pencil?                                       MILLER                          A small one.                 Miller shoos him off.                                       MILLER                          Go, go...                 Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.                 EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY                 Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the                others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA                CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion                in military history.                 The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered                with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles                winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored                by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-                shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers                swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships                and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of                hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some                distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.                 It s an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny                band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,                speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the                bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day                Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and                infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are                littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned                equipment, bodies.                 Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine                M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly                take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in                the back of the jeep.                                       REIBEN                          Captain, can I ask you a question?                                       MILLER                          Sure, Reiben.                                       REIBEN                          Where are you planning on putting                          Private Ryan, sir?                 Miller doesn t raise his eyes from the map.                                       REIBEN                               (continuing)                          It s just that it s kind of crowded                          back here, I was wondering if you re                          expecting to have more room on the                          way back?                 Miller points out a turn to Sarge.                                       MILLER                          Left.                 Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets                it.                                       MILLER                          Now we ve got a straight shot, due                          north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,                          two villages between here and there,                          St. Mere, then Bernay.  We ll take                          the jeep as far as we can, then go                          on on foot.                                       SARGE                          We in radio contact with anybody up                          there?                                       MILLER                          Somebody put the wrong crystals in                          every one of the Hundred-and-First s                          radios the night before the drop,                          not one of them works.  We re going                          in blind.                                       REIBEN                          I usually like surprises.                                       SARGE                          What are we likely to run into?                                       MILLER                          A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut                          divisions, no fronts, no lines, the                          drops were completely fouled up,                          we ve got little pockets of                          paratroopers all over the place,                          trying to hang on.  Command says we                          hold St. Mere, but north of that,                          it s all Krauts.  Even if Ryan s                          where he s supposed to be, he s more                          than likely dead.                                       SARGE                          Hell of a mission.                                       MILLER                          Yep, hell of a mission.                 IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP                 Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring                at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful                smile.                 Upham Hi.  So, uh, you re all Rangers?                 Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an                insect.                 Upham I m Upham.                 (pointing at his corporal s stripes)                 Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.                Their jaws drop.                                       REIBEN                               (to Wade)                          You want to shoot him, or should I?                 Wade It s not my turn.                                       REIBEN                               (politely)                          Jackson?                                       JACKSON                          Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,                          Cap n Miller near bit my head off.                 Upham reacts to the metion of Miller s name.                 Upham Miller?                                       MILLER                          I don t want anybody to shoot him,                          that s an order.  He speaks French                          and his German has a touch of the                          Bavarian.                 Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?                 Miller sighs, he knows what s coming.                                       UPHAM                               (continuing)                          ...who won the Congressional Medal                          of Hon...?                 Upham s words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances                of Miller s men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-                faced.                 No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as                if it had never happened.                                       REIBEN                          Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony                          of this mission is fucking killing                          me.                                       MILLER                          Yeah, how so?                                       REIBEN                          I should be on my way to Caen, sir.                          It s like Beethoven, the guy s one                          of the greatest composers ever lived                          and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,                          who d he piss off?  And here I am,                          the Beethoven of ladies foundation                          garments, one step away from Caen,                          the center of the known lingerie                          universe and instead, I m going to                          Ramelle to save some fucking private                          who s probably already dead.                                       MILLER                          There s to be a bright side, look                          for it.                                       REIBEN                          Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous                          for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company                          is going to Caen and we re going to                          the goddamned cheese capital of                          France.  There is no bright side.                                       MILLER                          There s always a bright side.                                       REIBEN                          I m listening, sir.                                       MILLER                          Well, I, for one, like cheese.                 Wade pipes up cheerfully.                 Wade Hell, I don t mind going to Ramelle, as long as there s                something up there for me to blow up.                                       REIBEN                          Well, you re a happy idiot.                 THEY ROUND A TURN                 SKID TO A STOP AT A:                 BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES                 A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.                                       MILLER                          How s the road up to St. Mere?                 Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There re some eighty-eights hiding                somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.                                       MILLER                          Anybody getting through?                 Lieutenant The lucky ones.                 Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying                gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels                down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.                They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct                hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.                 AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS                 On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of                a dozen American troops.  It s a nightmare vision.  Upham                grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham s                reaction.                                       IN THE BACK                          The men bounce up and down like                          stuffed animals, doing their best to                          not be thrown out.                                       REIBEN                          Hell, this is better than Coney                          Island!                                       A HUGE BUMP                          Bounces Reiben up and slams his back                          down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN                          PAIN.                                       MILLER                          Just trying to make room for Ryan.                 Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his                shovel from under his bruised ass.                 THEY ROUND A BEND                 See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,                obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.                 AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN                 Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER                                       MILLER                               (sweetly)                          Sarge?                 SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.                                       ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES                          Thirty yards ahead of them.                                       MILLER                          Directs Sarge off the road.                                       MILLER                          They ve got the road zeroed.                                       SARGE                          Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep                          off the road.                                       THE JEEP BOUNCES                          Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing                          everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.                          The jeep tears along the rutted field.                                       ANOTHER EXPLOSION                          Just behind them.                                       SARGE DRIVES MADLY                          Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid                          the biggest ruts and bumps.                                       ANOTHER EXPLOSION                          Close on their side.  Showers them                          with debris.                                       SARGE                          Jesus Christ!                 MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN                 Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.                                       MILLER                          They ve got a hell of a spotter                          somewhere.                                       ANOTHER EXPLOSION                          Even closer.  The jeep s PEPPERED                          WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH                          the smoke.                                       MILLER                          S-curves, Sarge.                                       SARGE                          Turns shallow curves without slowing                          down.                 SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER                 Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned                earth.  STOPS SHORT.                 REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON                 THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt.                                       SARGE AND MILLER                          Hang on.  Stay in the jeep but are                          battered.  All stunned.  MILLER Is                          first to regain his bearings.  Jumps                          up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.                          Deep in the soft dirt.                 AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT                                       MILLER                          Sarge!  Reverse!                 Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.                The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.                Yells to the others.                                       MILLER                          COME ON!  YOU WANNA WALK?                                       STILL DAZED                          Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw                          their heads back on.  Shoulder into                          the jeep.  Push for all they re worth.                          The WHEELS STILL SPIN.                 ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT                                       MILLER IGNORES IT                          He s the only one who does.                                       SARGE                          Captain, they got us zeroed.                 Upham is very nervous.                                       UPHAM                          That s bracketing, right?                 They all ignore him.                                       UPHAM                          I know about bracketing.  I read                          about it.  The next one is going to                          land right on us.                                       MILLER                          FORWARD!

Makes progress.                 ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.  WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.                                       SARGE                          Uh, Captain...                                       MILLER                          PUSH!

It s almost                          out.                 THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS                 Knowing the shell is coming any second.  Upham is beside                himself.                                       SARGE                               (sweetly)                          Oh, Captain...                                       ONE MORE PUSH                          The jeep rocks back in, deeper.                                       MILLER                          SHIT!                 THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN                                       MILLER                          GO!                                       THE MEN                          Instantly take off.  Away from the                          jeep.  As fast as they can.                 THE SHELL SCREAMS IN                 The men hit the dirt.                                       DIRECT HIT                          OBLITERATING THE JEEP                                       THE MEN                          Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.                          STUNNED by the concussion.  SHOWERED                          with dirt, rock and debris.                                       MILLER                          Is first up.  Sarge and the men                          struggle to their feet.  Hear MORE                          INCOMING.  Miller grabs Upham by the                          collar and pulls him up.                                       MILLER                          HERE COME THE MORTARS!                 THEY ALL TAKE OFF                 Running as fast as they can.                 THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN                 The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.  But                there must be a dozen mortars firing.  The shells are almost                constant.                                       THE FIELD                          The six Americans run madly, in zig-                          zag patterns through the gauntlet of                          MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  BOOM                                       RUNNING, STUMBLING                          BOOM, BOOM, BOOM                 UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND                 Miller yanks him up.  Half-drags him to the edge of the field.                 THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES                 Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards                in.                                       THE EXPLOSIONS STOP                          THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling                          to catch their breath. Check their                          body parts.  Everything s there.                          They have their weapons, most of                          their gear.                 Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is                nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head.                                       REIBEN                          General Gavin is going to be very                          irritated at you, Captain.                                       MILLER                          Stands on the edge of the woods,                          almost in a trance.                                       UPHAM                          Captain, I...                                       SARGE                          Sssssh!                 Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from                position to position.                                       MILLER                          Sarge, maps.                 Sarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent,                frozen in place.                                       MILLER                          Two eighty-eights, just under two-                          and-a-half miles, that way, vector                          from the jeep, through those two                          trees at the base of the hill.  The                          mortars came from behind that rise,                          there, four of them.                 Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out                of it.                                       MILLER                          Wade, the radio.                 Wade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed.                                       UPHAM                          You can tell all that, just by the                          sound, sire?                                       MILLER                          That s not all.  There were nine                          gunners on the eighty-eights, one                          had a broken heel on his boot, two                          had bratwurst for supper last night,                          one of them is named Fritz, the other,                          Hans, maybe, I don t know, it s hard                          to tell.                                       JACKSON                          Corporal, you have just seen one of                          Captain Miller s many God-given                          talents.  If, by some miracle, you                          survive, you will witness many more                          of them.                 Sarge finished vectoring.                                       SARGE                          Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care                          of those eighty-eights?                                       MILLER                          That s not what we re here for.                                       WADE                               (re. radio)                          I ve got command, Captain.                 Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.                                       MILLER                               (into radio)                          This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,                          sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-                          three by baker-three.  Two eighty-                          eights.  Tell our boys to come in                          low from the east in case the Krauts                          have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over.                 A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade                packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir,                wouldn t take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.                                       SARGE                          He s right, Captain, it might be                          kind of dangerous for those flyboys.

The rest                of the men don t like it, but they follow.  Upham trails,                amazed at Miller.                 EXT. WOODS - DAY                 Miller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in                alongside Reiben.                                       UPHAM                          So, where are you from?                                       REIBEN                          Get lost.

UPHAM                               (continuing)                          That I m so fucking tired of this                          goddamned walking, I d pay a thousand                          dollars to see that bastard Ryan                          crawl on his belly over an acre of                          broken glass to hear my great-aunt                          Martha fart through a field-phone.                 The men are stunned.                                       REIBEN                          Jesus Christ, he s a natural!                                       MILLER                          Upham, are you sure you ve never                          been in combat?                 Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I m certain                I d remember.                 Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.                                       MILLER                          He s good.                 They walk on.                                       JACKSON                          Cap n, my feet are most uncomfortable.                 Miller smiles, situation normal.                 EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON                 A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active                battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR                EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers                crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.                 Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a                couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across                and disappear into the remains of a building.                 Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a                corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread                out down the block behind him.                 Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental                picture of a GATHERING OF G.I. s crouching in the cover of                an alley across the street and down the block.  They are                CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller s age, and HIS MEN.                 As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET                SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.                 Miller motions Jackson across first.                                       MILLER                          Stay low.                 Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,                kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and                makes it to the cover of the far side.                                       JACKSON                          Dang!  That was close!                 Miller nods to Upham.                                       MILLER                          Your turn.                 Upham, scared shitless, doesn t move.  Miller speaks to him                very gently.                                       MILLER                          Zig-zag, change your pace a couple                          times, you ll be alright.                 Upham s frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.                                       MILLER                          Okay, I m going to draw fire for                          you.                               (sternly)                          But if I do, you goddamned well better                          go.                 Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.                 CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER S HAND quivers.                                       MILLER                          Looks to Upham                                       MILLER                          Ready?                 Upham nods, still terrified.                 MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN                 Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.                                       MILLER                          Go.                 Upham runs.                 A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.                 He doesn t budge.                 UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.                 REIBEN watches Upham run.                                       REIBEN                          Hey, that guy can move.                 A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller s ear.  UPHAM gets to                the far side.                 MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don t                even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.                He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.                                       SARGE                               (under his breath so                               only Miller can hear)                          Damn fool.                               (beat)                          Sir.                                       REIBEN                          Captain, he s fast!                                       MILLER                               (glances at Sarge,                               speaks to Reiben)                          Glad of it.                                       UPHAM                          On the other side of the street,                          crouches in a doorway with Jackson.                          Upham is a bit in shock, less from                          the nearness of the bullets than                          from what Miller just did for him.                                       MILLER                          DASHES across the street.                 GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches                behind him.                 HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.                                       MILLER                          Bring  em over.                 UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.                                       UPHAM                          Captain, I...                 Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.                                       MILLER                          One at a time.                                       MILLER                          Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-                          runs down the block.  He passes a:                                       BOMBED OUT BUILDING                          Out of the line of fire.  A dozen                          dead American soldiers lined up on                          the ground.  The battered, bloody                          bodies, only partially covered by                          ponchos.                 Some badly wounded G.I. s are being treated next to the dead.                Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.                                       MILLER                          Sees the dead and wounded, shows no                          reaction.  Runs to:                                       AN ALLEY                          Captain Hamill and his men are bunched                          there, out of the line of fire.                          He s sending off a squad to continue                          their door-to-door.                 Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the                corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.                 The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two                captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak                familiarly.                 Captain hamill How was the road in?                                       MILLER                          We had a jeep until a few hours ago,                          a nice one, it had a cute little                          flag with a couple of stars on it.                 Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.                 One by one, Miller s men join them in the alley.                                       MILLER                          We called in a strike on the eighty-                          eights that took it out, but it s                          the Kraut spotter that counts,                          wherever the hell that bastard is.                 Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant                chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.                 Captain hamill That s where your boy is.  We ve been trying                to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying                to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant                steeple.                                       MILLER                          Jackson.                 Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson                knows what he s supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and                takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to                his back.                 He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and                methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very                unusual, long-barrel, rifle.                 Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,                along with Upham, watch curiously.                 Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,                sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he                takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He                adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham                is fascinated.                                       UPHAM                          What is that?                 Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized                shell.                                       JACKSON                          Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel                          with dual-groove, parallel rifling,                          elevated three-glass scope and a                          single-throw hammer.                                       UPHAM                          The Army gave you that?                                       JACKSON                          Yep.                                       UPHAM                          You must be a hell a shot.                                       JACKSON                          Not where I come from.                 Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and                FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.                 Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the                dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight                and waits, absolutely motionless.                                       UPHAM                          That must be four thousand yards.                                       JACKSON                               (without taking his                               eye from the scope)                          Forty-two-hundred, I figure.                                       UPHAM                          You take account of the wind?                 Jackson doesn t dignify that with an answer but he looks                back with an expression that clearly says,  What are you,                some kind of fucking idiot?  Reiben puts himself between                Upham and Jackson.                                       REIBEN                               (put-on Southern accent)                          Dang right, he take  count of the                          wind, ain t ya ll ever heard a                          Kentucky windage?                 Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the                trigger.                                       JACKSON                          Reiben, how many time I got to tell                          you, I m from Tennessee.                                       REIBEN                          They got squirrels there, too, right?                 Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart                the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his                radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them                the St. Mere road is open.                 The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to                Miller.                 Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?                                       MILLER                          Very far, they re not coming this                          way, they re going to take Caen first.                 Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We re in a                lot of trouble up here, and it s gonna get worse before it                gets better.  How many men did you bring?                                       MILLER                          Five, but we not staying, we re on                          our way to Ramelle.                 Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private                Ryan?                                       MILLER                          Yeah, you know about that?                 Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in                with the early wounded or dead.                 Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED                PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.                 Captain hamill We re supposed to tell you, they intercepted                a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two                companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,                they ll be there sometime late tomorrow.                                       MILLER                          Wonderful.                 Captain Hamill If Ryan s alive, you d better get him the                hell out of there before those Krauts show up.                                       MILLER                          How do we get out of here?                 Captain hamill You don t, until tonight, we re hemmed in                real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If                you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,                you ve got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by                tomorrow night.                 Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his                head.                 Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?                 Miller shrugs.                 Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but                I understand what you re doing?                                       MILLER                          Yeah?                 Captain hamill Good luck.                                       MILLER                          Thanks.                 Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.                 Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill s forceful                sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.                                       MILLER                          Let s find someplace to hole up.                 Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head                of the alley, Miller passes Upham.                                       UPHAM                          Sir, I m sorry about what happened,                          I...                                       MILLER                               (interrupting)                          It was nothing.                                       UPHAM                          But you could have gotten killed and                          I...                                       MILLER                               (interrupting)                          Like I said, it was nothing.                               (to the men)                          Don t bunch up.                 He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham                watches him go.                                       UPHAM                          Did you see what he did, back there?                          He stepped right into the open, so I                          could get across.                                       JACKSON                          Shit, that was no big deal.                                       WADE                          They can t kill him.                                       SARGE                          Like hell they can t.                                       REIBEN                          Wade s right, it s some kind of                          scientific, magnetic thing, I can t                          explain it, but I ve seen it.                                       WADE                          We all have, he s got nine lives, or                          he s bulletproof, or some damn thing.                 The men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is                neither.                                       SARGE                          No one s bulletproof.  No one.                               (beat)                          C mon, stay low.                 Sarge takes off after Miller.                 EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK                 Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins                of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable                spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.                Reiben paces.                                       REIBEN                          Captain, could you please explain                          the math of this mission to me?                                       MILLER                          Sure, what do you want to know?                                       REIBEN                          Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,                          since when does six equal one?  What s                          the sense in risking six guys to                          save one?                                       MILLER                          Ours is not to reason why.                                       REIBEN                          Huh?                                       MILLER                          Never mind, don t worry, we ll pick                          up this kid, high-tail it back to                          division, everything ll work out                          fine.                                       REIBEN                          I d much rather die in Caen than                          Ramelle, sir.  It s a personal thing.                                       MILLER                          Reiben, there s a fairly good chance                          you re not going to die at all.                                       REIBEN                          Easy for you to say, sir.                               (beat)                          Fucking James Ryan, I d like to wring                          his fucking neck.                                       SARGE                          Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor                          bastard s mother.                                       REIBEN                          Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you                          got a mother?                                       JACKSON                          Last I knew.                                       REIBEN                          Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of                          us, hell, I ll bet even the Captain                          has a mother.                 Miller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.                                       REIBEN                          Well, maybe not the Captain, but the                          rest of us have mothers.                                       MILLER                          You have orders, too.                                       JACKSON                          Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.                                       MILLER                          I d love to hear it.                                       JACKSON                          Seems to me, Cap n, this mission is                          a serious misallocation of valuable                          military resources.  Miller Go on.                                       JACKSON                          Well, sir, by my way a thinkin  I am                          a finely made instrument of warfare.                          What I mean by that is, if you was                          to put me with this here sniper rifle                          anywhere up to and includin  one                          mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear                          line of sight, war s over.                 Miller nods.                                       MILLER                          Reiben, I want you to listen closely                          to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe.                          Jackson, continue.                                       JACKSON                          Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that                          the entire resources of the United                          States Army oughta be dedicated to                          one thing and one thing only, and                          that is to put me and this here weapon                          on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle                          of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain t one                          to question decisions made up on                          high, sir, but it seems to me that                          saving one private, no matter how                          grievous the losses of his family,                          is a waste of my God-given talent.                                       MILLER                          Wade?                                       WADE                          Hell, I don t mind this mission,                          sir, as long as there s something up                          at Ramelle for...                                       REIBEN                               (finishing Wade s                               sentence)                          ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,                          we heard that.                                       MILLER                          Upham?                                       UPHAM                          Pass.                                       MILLER                          Sarge?                                       SARGE                          I m just here to keep a bunch of                          numb-nuts, including one certain,                          frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,                          from getting themselves killed.                 Reiben eyes Miller.                                       REIBEN                          And what about you, Captain?                 Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.                                       MILLER                          Reiben, what s the matter with you?                          I don t gripe to you.  I m a captain.                          There s a chain of command.  Griping                          goes one way, up, only up, never                          down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to                          my superior officers.  Up, get it?                          I don t gripe to you, I don t gripe                          in front of you.  How long you been                          in the army?                                       REIBEN                          I m sorry, sir, I apologize.                               (beat)                          But if you weren t a captain, or if                          I were a major, what would you say?                 Miller considers his response.                                       MILLER                          In that case, I would say this is an                          excellent mission, with an extremely                          valuable objective, worthy of my                          best efforts.                 Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no                obvious sarcasm.                                       MILLER                               (continuing)                          In addition, as I pointed out earlier,                          I have a fondness for cheese and I                          hope to have the opportunity to sample                          some of the Ramelle products, when                          we arrive there, to see if they live                          up to their excellent reputation.                          Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow                          for the mother of Private James Ryan                          and I m more than willing to lay                          down my life, and the lives of my                          men, especially you, Reiben, to help                          relieve her suffering.  The men                          thoroughly enjoy the performance.                                       REIBEN                          Sir, if you were not a captain, I                          would compliment you, now, for being                          an excellent liar.                                       MILLER                          But I am a captain.  If I were not a                          captain, I would thank you for the                          compliment and tell you that the                          ability to lie comes from being a                          top-notch poker player, which I am,                          having learned at the side of my                          mother who is, by popular acclaim,                          the best poker player in...                 The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they re                about to find out Miller s home town.  Miller smiles.                                       MILLER                               (continuing)                          ...my home town, which shall remain                          un-named.                 The men ease back, disappointed.                                       MILLER                          Any further thoughts on the subject?                                       REIBEN                          Yes, sir, as a final note, I d like                          to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,                          fuck the cheese capital of France                          and while we re at it, fuck Private                          James Ryan.                                       MILLER                          I ll make a note of your suggestions                          but I ll leave that last one to you,                          especially if he s already dead.                 The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets                serious.                                       MILLER                          We move out in two hours, try and                          get some sleep.                 The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all                settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to                follow Miller s order.  Upham looks around at these strange                men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow                suit.                 Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his                flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,                he studies his maps while his men rest.                 EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)                 Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,                Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his                flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,                watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in                Miller s map case and speaks quietly to him.                                       SARGE                          You ever going to open those letters?                          Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.                                       MILLER                          Maybe.                                       SARGE                          It s not normal, not reading letters                          from home.                                       MILLER                          Since when have things been normal?                                       SARGE                          You got me.  Afraid of bad news?                                       MILLER                          Nope.                                       SARGE                          Good news?                 Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of                them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at                the men.                                       SARGE                          You think they ll be alright?                                       MILLER                          They re fine.  As long as they can                          gripe, they ll be alright.                                       SARGE                          And what about you?                 Miller considers the question, doesn t answer.                                       MILLER                          They guys here aren t going to be                          able to hold out until battalion                          shows up.                                       SARGE                          Nope.                                       MILLER                          Command isn t going to let them                          withdraw and the Germans sure as                          hell aren t going to let them                          surrender.                                       SARGE                          Three for three.                                       MILLER                          If we stayed, we could make a                          difference.                                       SARGE                          You re kidding yourself.                                       MILLER                          You never know.                 They sit in silence for a moment.                                       SARGE                          I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.                                       MILLER                          Now you re the one kidding yourself.                               (beat)                          Hell of  a mission.                                       SARGE                          Yup, hell of a mission.                 Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.                                       MILLER                          Rise and shine, boys.  Let s go.                 Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their                gear.                 EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT                 SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY                BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral                toward the outskirts of town.  They re just a small squad,                but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are                very formidable-looking.                 EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT                 Miller s men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill                and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:                 A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON                 Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The                AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the                countryside like a tidal wave.                 Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.                 IT S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY                is incredible, strange, other-worldly.                 EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.                 Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.                 MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.                 SARGE notices, says nothing.                 MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes                go back to the BLAZING SKY.                                       SARGE                               (awe-struck)                          Makes you feel small, doesn t it?                                       MILLER                          It doesn t take this.                 Upham s face shows more fear than awe.                                       UPHAM                          I wasn t made for this.                                       MILLER                               (bitterly)                          You think the rest of us were?                 Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns                to Upham and sees that he s really scared.  Miller get a                hold of himself and speaks gently.                                       MILLER                          Don t worry, Upham, God ll protect                          you, this shit s gonna keep him up                          all night, anyway.                 Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for                a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.                                       MILLER                          Let s go, this ain t what they pay                          us for.                 Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points                the way.                 Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there s a                gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until                you clear the second field, then you ll hit the woods.                 As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to                move out, on of Captain Hamill s men, the Gentle-Faced Private                who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up                with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to                Reiben.                 Gentle-faced private Here.                 Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-                ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private s                vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.                 Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at                Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.                 Reiben takes the ammo.                                       REIBEN                               (gently)                          Just what I need.                 Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands                them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.                                       MILLER                          Thanks, but you may need these more                          than us, or Ryan.                 Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes                the ammo back.                                       MILLER                          Let s move out.                 Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,                lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill                and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a                strange bit of hope.                 EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT                 The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The                night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way                warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside                Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don t overhear.                Sarge How long s your hand been shaking?                                       MILLER                          A couple of weeks.  It started in                          Portsmouth when they brought us down                          for loading.                                       SARGE                          Is it getting worse?                                       MILLER                          No.  It comes and goes.  It stops                          when I look at it.                                       SARGE                          You may have to find yourself a new                          line of work, this one doesn t seem                          to agree with you anymore.                                       MILLER                          I ll be alright.                 Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk                on.                 EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)                 Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at                point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge                brings up the rear.                 A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate                only with hand signals.                 JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.                 MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease                into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY                MEN appear.                 REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission                to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals,  let them                go.  A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the                bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of                relief and lowers hi B.A.R.                 THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet                from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed                with fear.  The others are stone-faced.                 THE GERMANS PASS.                 MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.                 UPHAM doesn t see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh                of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing                the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.                 UPHAM FREEZES.  He s standing, barely in the shadows, nearly                exposed.  Shitting bricks.                 Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad                approaches.                 Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in                the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-                kneed, amazed that he s still alive.                 MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the                rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries                after Miller, staying close on his heels.                 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                 The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,                parallel to a cart path.  Wary.                 Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each                other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and                motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.                 EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT                 Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as                Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional                signs.  One of them reads:   Ramelle 16 Km.  Miller puts                away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn                is visible.                                       MILLER                          It ll be light, soon.  Let s pick it                          up.                 EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN                 First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by                the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.                 Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at                the view.  It s lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.                The war is far away.                 Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together                without speaking for a moment.                                       MILLER                          It looks like a Renoir.                                       UPHAM                          Yes.  Do you know Sibelius  Fourth                          Symphony, The Normandy?                                       MILLER                          I ve been humming it.                                       UPHAM                          I heard.                                       MILLER                          It seemed appropriate.                                       UPHAM                          You know classical music?                                       MILLER                          Some.                                       UPHAM                          Where are you from, Captain?                 Miller smiles.                                       MILLER                          What s the pool up to?                 Upham smiles, caught.                                       UPHAM                          Over three-hundred.                                       MILLER                          I ll tell you what, if I m still                          alive when it hits five-hundred,                          I ll let you know and we ll split                          the money.                                       UPHAM                          If that s the way you feel, why don t                          we wait until it s up to a thousand.                                       MILLER                          I don t expect to live that long.                 Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.                                       UPHAM                          Five hundred, then.                 Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to                feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself                back into a commander and barks at Upham.                                       MILLER                          Let s go, private.                 Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure                him out, then he simply follows him.                 EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN                 The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by                war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is                lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,                hundred of years old.                 Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They                advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.                An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to                this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and                a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a                draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.                A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with                empty shell casings around his body.                 Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to                Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks                gently to him in French.                 The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands                and translates.                                       UPHAM                          Five nights ago, he found this                          paratrooper caught in a tree with a                          broken leg.  The leg got infected.                          Last night he went to Ville Cholet                          to get a doctor.  The doctor refused                          to come and when he got back, this                          is what he found.  The Krauts must                          have shown up while he was gone.                                       MILLER                          Did he see any sign of them?                 Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.                                       UPHAM                          No, but he heard firing, just east,                          less that a kilometer.                                       MILLER                          Thank him and tell him we re sorry                          about his loss.                 Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.                Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.                 Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his                hand on the man s shoulder, then rises and follows the others.                 EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY                 A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last                of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.                 The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the                edge of the field.                 Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches                and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.                 Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to                some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with                bullets.                 Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.                                       WADE                          Captain.                 Staying low, they join Wade who has found:                 TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS                 A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.                 MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON                 Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The                others crawl up behind them.                                       MILLER                          Where?                                       JACKSON                          In the shadow by those two trees.                                       MILLER                          My guess, too.                                       UPHAM                          What is it?                                       MILLER                          A machine gun.                 Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover                of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.                                       REIBEN                          Sir, I ve got an idea, let s go                          around.                                       MILLER                          We can t leave it here.                                       JACKSON                          We left them eighty-eights.                                       MILLER                          They don t send planes to put out                          machine guns.                               (beat)                          Two flank runners with surpressing                          fire.  I m going right, whoever goes                          left has to be fast.                 Upham steels himself and steps forward.                                       UPHAM                          Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.                                       REIBEN                          He s fast, Captain, I saw him.                 Miller takes Upham s measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.                                       WADE                          How fast?                                       UPHAM                          Twenty-four-five.                                       WADE                          Shit, that s nothing, I ran twenty-                          two flat.                                       MILLER                          Wade goes left.                 Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is                impressed.                                       UPHAM                          Twenty-two flat?                 Wade takes a grenade from Upham s chest strap.                                       WADE                          I would have won the states if some                          bastard hadn t tripped me in the                          finals.                 Miller points the others to their firing positions.                                       MILLER                          Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,                          ten yards, either side.                 As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,                out of earshot of the men.                                       SARGE                          Rule of thumb, Captain, says you                          ought to detail this one, instead of                          going yourself.                 Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.                                       MILLER                          Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?                                       SARGE                          How about I go right, sir?                                       MILLER                          How about you take your position?                 Sarge hesitates.                                       SARGE                          How about...?                                       MILLER                               (interrupting)                          How about you shut up and take your                          position?                 Sarge nods.                                       SARGE                          Yes, sir.                 Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near                Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.                                       UPHAM                          Good luck, Captain.                                       MILLER                          Don t need it, I m a cat, I ve got                          five lives.                                       UPHAM                          The men said, nine.                                       MILLER                          What do they know?                               (beat)                          I had nine, but I feel through the                          ice when I was seven, my brother                          pulled me out.  Then I used one when                          a grenade landed in my foxhole in                          Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one                          on the beaches, one on the cliffs                          and two getting here.                                       UPHAM                          That only leaves three.                                       MILLER                          Plenty.                 Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.                                       MILLER                          Ready?                                       WADE                          Yes, sir.                 Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.                 MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.                 Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a                moment.  Then:                 A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.                 SHATTERING THE QUIET.                                       IN THE NEST                          A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING                          THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE                          8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.                          Four Germans in the nest, four more                          outlying riflemen.                                       MILLER                          Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE                          DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over                          him.                 THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS                WADE HITS THE DIRT                 The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.                 SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM                 Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS                THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.                 THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND                SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT                 Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.                                       SARGE                          FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.                          No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.                          SLAMS in another.  FIRES.                 THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER                 He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.                                       WADE                          Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly                          row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward                          him.                                       MILLER                          Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles                          up the roots.  Dives through the                          brush.                                       WADE                          On a slight rise.  Can t hit the                          dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately                          sprints.                 WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.                Goes down.                 SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest.                                       MILLER                          STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.                          Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to                          his feet, running.  Swings his                          Thompson into firing position.  Racing                          toward the nest.                 SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.                                       MILLER                          Tearing along the path.  Sees a German                          rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM                          DOWN.  Runs over the body without                          breaking stride.                 SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN                FIRE from Miller.                 The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow                he s not hit.                                       MILLER                          TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his                          Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German                          riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls                          the pin.                                       THE NEST                          The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel                          from Sarge.  Too late.                                       MILLER                          THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.                 THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are                KILLED.                 SARGE hollers to the others.                                       SARGE                          HOLD YOUR FIRE!                                       MILLER                          Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another                          BURST.  KILLS the last of the German                          riflemen.  Doesn t pause.  RUNS onto                          the field.                 SARGE AND THE OTHERS                 See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto                the field.                                       WADE                          Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.                          Astonished by the pain.                 ALL THE AMERICANS RUN                 Converging on Wade.  Miller points, and yells, without slowing                down.                                       MILLER                          REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER!  COVER!                                       REIBEN AND UPHAM                          Stop instantly.  Turn toward the                          perimeter of the field.                                       SARGE                          Roots through his medical kit as he                          runs.  Dropping and scattering                          inessentials behind him.                                       WADE                          Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too                          much pain.                 MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE                 Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both                tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping                one open.  Powder spills.                 REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.                                       SARGE                          Pulls Wade s hands from the wound.                          Pours sulfa powder.                                       MILLER                          About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the                          wound.  Stops.  Knows it s fatal.                                       MILLER                          Damn it!                 Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.                                       SARGE                          Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.                                       SARGE                          Sulfa, more sulfa...                                       WADE                          Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.                          Sees him preparing the morphine shot.                          They both know.                                       WADE                          Yeah...morphine...make it a                          double...huh...Captain...?                                       MILLER                          SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade s neck.                          Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine                          straight to Wade s brain.  Motions                          impatiently to Sarge.                                       MILLER                          More morphine, hurry up, come on,                          come on...                                       SARGE                          Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.                          Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the                          morphine.                                       MILLER                          Snatches the morphine from Sarge.                          Quickly and efficiently prepares a                          second shot.  He s done this before.                                       REIBEN                          On guard, glancing back.  Pissed                          off.                                       REIBEN                          Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn                          it...                                       UPHAM                          Freaked out.  Trying to keep his                          eyes on the perimeter.  Can t.                                       JACKSON                          Watching.                                       MILLER                          Gives Wade the second shot.                                       WADE                          Feels the effects of the first shot.                          He sees Upham and manages a pained                          smile.                 WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,                without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE                DIES                 ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE                 UPHAM begins to weep.                 REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:                                       REIBEN                          Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn                          it...                                       MILLER                          Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently                          closes Wade s eyes.  His hand quivers                          slightly as he unclips one of Wades                          dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.                          Sarge notices.                 Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men                see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.                 Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,                rises and picks up his Thompson.                 Upham shakes his head.                                       UPHAM                          That was no twenty-two flat.                 Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.                                       MILLER                          He lied.  Let s move out.                 Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men                hesitate, then slowly follow him.                 EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY                 A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.                The five G.I. s walk, spread out.                                       REIBEN                          Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,                          just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-                          bitch.                                       JACKSON                          Shut up, will you?                                       REIBEN                          You shut up, this is the most fucked                          up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned                          Ryan, fuck the little bastard.                                       JACKSON                          Just shut up, Ryan didn t kill Wade.                                       REIBEN                          The hell he didn t.                 Miller motions to them curtly.                                       MILLER                          Keep it down.                 They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,                the men don t hear.                                       MILLER                          We ve got to find someplace to hole                          up for a bit.                 Sarge looks at Miller closely.                                       SARGE                          You alright?                                       MILLER                          Let s just find someplace.                 EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY                 Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good                hiding place.                                       MILLER                          Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,                          perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.                          I m going to re-con.                 Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but                there s something missing.  It s subtle.  Only Sarge notices.                He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.                 EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY                 Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The                life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,                tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for                faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,                as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,                Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller                senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a                thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.                                       MILLER                          What was the name of that kid at                          Anzio, the one who got his face burned                          off?                                       SARGE                          Vecchio.                                       MILLER                          Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn t remember                          his name, he was a good kid, remember                          how he used to walk on his hands and                          sing that song about the man on flying                          trapeze?                                       SARGE                          Yeah.                                       MILLER                          You know why I m such a good officer?                          Because of my mother.  Have I ever                          told you about her?                                       SARGE                          Bits and pieces.                                       MILLER                          She s the best poker player you ever                          saw.  My father used to go to these                          Saturday night games and lose his                          shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him                          an ultimatum, either she gets a                          regular seat at the table or she                          locks him in every Saturday night.                          He squawked and so did his buddies                          but after a while they gave in and                          from the first night she sat down,                          she never lost.  She could read those                          cocky bastards like they were playing                          open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had                          sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her                          eyes, the tone of her voice, her                          bets, her jokes, the way she sipped                          her coffee, she was a master.  She                          won more money on shit hands than                          anyone in the history of the game.                          Every Saturday night, my father would                          lose two, three hundred bucks and                          she d win it all back and then some.                          And I d stand there, glued to her                          shoulder, from the time I was five                          years old, watching every hand, every                          move, studying how she did it.                               (beat)                          That s why I m such a good officer,                          I can look at a man s face and tell                          you exactly what he s holding, and                          if it s a shit hand, I know just                          what cards to deal him.                                       SARGE                          And what about your own hand?                                       MILLER                          No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?                          So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear                          me apart when I d get one of my men                          killed, but what was I supposed to                          do?  Break down in front of the ones                          who were standing there waiting for                          me to tell them what to do?  Of course                          not, so I bluffed, and after a while,                          I started to fall for my own bluff.                          It was great, it made everything so                          much easier.  Sarge Is that why your                          hand s been shaking?                                       MILLER                          It could be worse.  You know the                          first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?                          Lie to your men.                                       SARGE                          Oh, yeah?                                       MILLER                          Not in so many words, but they tell                          you you can have all the firepower                          in the world and if your men don t                          have good morale, it s not worth a                          damn.  So if you re scared or empty                          or half-a-step from a Section Eight,                          do you tell your men?  Of course                          not.  You bluff, you lie.                                       SARGE                          And how do you bluff yourself?                                       MILLER                          Simple, numbers.  Every time you                          kill one of your men, you tell                          yourself you just saved the lives of                          two, three, ten, a hundred others.                          We lost, what, thirty-one on the                          cliffs?  I ll bet we saved ten times                          that number by putting out those                          guns.  That s over three hundred                          men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.                          Then thousand.  Any number you want.                          See?  It s simple.  It lets you always                          choose mission over men.                                       SARGE                          Except this time, the mission IS a                          man.                                       MILLER                          That s the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who s                          Ryan?  If they re both standing in                          front of me and I have to shoot one                          or the other, how do I choose?  Look                          at my hand, there it goes again.                                       SARGE                          John, I ve got to tell you, I think                          you re about used up.                                       MILLER                          I think you re right, Keith.                                       SARGE                          You want me to take over?                 The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He                looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.                                       MILLER                          No, but if I get any worse, you ll                          have to relieve me.                                       SARGE                               (sighs)                          Just what I want to do.                 They share a smile.                                       MILLER                          You know Wade was the eleventh of                          the twelve, you re the last one still                          alive.                                       SARGE                          I know.                                       MILLER                          Don t let yourself get killed, if                          you do, they might make me give back                          the medal and then I won t be able                          to lip off to colonels anymore.                                       SARGE                          I ll do my best.                 They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller                Hell of a...                                       (BEAT)                          Ah, forget it.                 Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting                himself.  He s about ninety-five percent there.                                       MILLER                          Thanks for drawing that machine gun                          off me.                                       SARGE                          You re welcome, John.                                       MILLER                          But, that s my personal brand of                          stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary                          about it, if you do it again, you re                          busted.                 Sarge allows himself a slight smile.                                       SARGE                          Yes, sir.                 Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back                to the men.                 EXT. CLEARING - DAY                 The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.                No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.                Miller barks at the men.                                       MILLER                          Up.  We re moving out.                                       REIBEN                          I thought you said we had an hour,                          sir?                                       MILLER                          Well now I m saying we re moving                          out.  Get off your ass.                 The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow.                                       MILLER                          What the hell s the matter with you,                          Jackson?                                       JACKSON                          Sir, I ain t feeling so chipper on                          account of Wade.                                       MILLER                          Who s Wade?                 No one responds.                                       MILLER                          I said, who the hell is Wade?                 The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.                                       JACKSON                          Sir, I understand what you re doin ,                          but I respectfully request permission                          to grieve in my own manner.                                       MILLER                          You ll grieve the way I tell you to                          goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,                          there was one, but he died a long                          time ago, he s been dead for so long                          you can hardly remember his name,                          you understand?                                       JACKSON                          Sir, I understand.  I don t like it,                          but I understand.                                       MILLER                          Good, now get your goddamned gear.                 The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.                Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his                head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit                to work.  He knows they have no choice.                 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY                 Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,                grim.                 EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY                 Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds                up the map, points the way and they move out.                 EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY                 More progress.  The men are still grim.                                       REIBEN                          You know what the best possible thing                          that could happen is?                                       JACKSON                          Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get                          lockjaw, never say another word as                          long as you live.                 Miller laughs.  Miller I ll bite, Reiben.                                       REIBEN                          I ve given this a lot of thought,                          sir.  The best thing that could happen                          is, we find Ryan and he s dead.                                       MILLER                          Why s that?                                       REIBEN                          Well, sir, consider the possibilities.                          A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take                          him back to the beach.  Knowing you,                          you don t let him carry my gear,                          even though he really should, and we                          all get killed, trying to keep him                          alive.                                       MILLER                          Except for the last part, that one s                          not bad.                                       REIBEN                          B:  Ryan is dead.  He s been blown                          up by the German equivalent of Wade,                          whose name I know you don t want me                          to mention.  There s nothing to find.                          The biggest piece is the size of a                          pea.  We wander around, looking for                          him until the Germans pick us off,                          one after another.                                       MILLER                          I don t like that one.                                       REIBEN                          Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is                          the worst one, we find Ryan and he s                          wounded.  Not only does he not carry                          my gear, we have to carry his gear.                          And him.                                       MILLER                          But we accomplish the mission.                                       REIBEN                          Maybe.  But what if he dies on the                          way back?  you see what I m saying,                          sir?  The best possible situation                          is, he s dead, we find his body,                          more or less intact, we grab one of                          his dog-tags and high-tail it back                          to the beach, or better yet, we head                          over to Caen and catch up with                          division.                                       MILLER                          Has anyone ever told you, you re                          officer material?                                       REIBEN                          No, sir.                                       MILLER                          That s a mystery to me.                 No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.                 EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY                 The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush                near the crossroads.  A sign reads:   Ramelle 3 Km.   Miller                folds up the map.                                       SARGE                          Looks like we re going to beat those                          Kraut companies to Ramelle.                 Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something                the others don t hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they                do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It s an OMINOUS RUMBLE.                                       MILLER                          I don t think so.                 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY                 THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop                trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack                Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a                bridge.                 CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL                 Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.                Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.                                       GERMAN FLANK SQUADS                          Hurry along the fields on either                          side of the road, trying to keep up                          with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS                          MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching                          German Flank Squad.  They flatten                          themselves into the mucky water.                          Ready their weapons.  Prepare to                          fire.                                       THE GERMAN SQUAD                          Approaches the bridge.                 PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES                 See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.                                       MILLER                          Is just about to open up on them.                                       THE GERMAN SERGEANT                          Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind                          and CALLS to them.                                       THE GERMAN PRIVATES                          Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the                          convoy.                                       IN THE CULVERT                          The Americans breathe again.                                       UPHAM                          I wonder where they re going.                                       MILLER                          Same place we are.                 Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast                is clear.  They head out.                 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY                 A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,                cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone                walls.  The twos is visible beyond.                 Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the                stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.                 ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD                 There s a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.                                       MILLER                          Scans the Germans with his binoculars.                                       REIBEN                          Looks like tea time, maybe they re                          Brits.                                       UPHAM                          I sure hope so.                                       SARGE                          What do you think they re waiting                          for, Captain?                 Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more                threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER                and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know                that sound, they don t like it.                 FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS                 Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who                greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,                far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two                tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and                impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman s nightmare.                There are four of them.                                       MILLER                          Puts away the binoculars and jerks                          his head for his men to follow, low,                          along the wall.  The men are happy                          to do so, looking back nervously at                          the German tanks.                 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY                 The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is                a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell                casings and bodies, German and American and a few French                civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons                ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.                 Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging                debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of                the firing.                 Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He                signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the                firing.                 They move on, dashing from cover to cover.                 EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY                 A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC                FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near                the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of                heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings                are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.                There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on                both sides of the bridge.                 MILLER AND HIS MEN                 Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the                bridge.                                       REIBEN                          Looks like they ve been having a                          hell of a party, here, Captain.                                       MILLER                          ON THE BRIDGE!  WE RE COMING IN.                 A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.                                       VOICE FROM BRIDGE                          KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.                                       MILLER                          YOU FIRE AT US AND I LL DO A HELL OF                          A LOT MORE THAN THAT.                                       VOICE FROM BRIDGE                          WHO WON THE  38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?                 Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty.                                       MILLER                          I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE                          COME.                               (to his men)                          Cover me.                                       REIBEN                          What if our guys open up, sir?                                       MILLER                          You re only allowed to shoot at                          Germans, that s one of the rules.                                       REIBEN                          Have it your way, Captain.                 Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward                the bridge.                 THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP                 Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.                                       MILLER S MEN                          POUR FIRE at the German positions,                          SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.                                       ON THE BRIDGE                          The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM                          OF BULLETS at the German positions.                 Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive                jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.                 He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the                young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are                some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller                catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to                nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.                                       MILLER                          I ll keep it in mind.                               (calls to Sarge)                          OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.                 Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller s men as                they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.                 Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to                hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it s been six days.                                       MILLER                          Things are tough all over.  We re                          looking for a Private James Ryan.                 Forrest Ryan?                                       MILLER                          Is he here?                 Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.                 Forrest Go get Ryan.                                       (TO MILLER)                          What do you want him for, sir?                 Miller doesn t answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and                scrambles to them.                                       MILLER                          Jackson, get a hold of command.                 Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to                Forrest.                                       MILLER                          How many men do you have?                 They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller s men                to leap over the barricade.                 Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge                was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us                ever since.  They must want it intact or we d be long gone.                 Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller s                hailing I.D.   No response.                                       JACKSON                          Not yet.                                       MILLER                          Keep trying.                 Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?                 Miller doesn t answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:                                       PRIVATE JAMES RYAN                          Dashing from cover to cover, making                          his way toward them.  Ryan is an                          American classic, nineteen years                          old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.                          Though he s exhausted, unshaven, and                          smeared with dirt and blood, he s                          very alive.  His eyes shine, his                          face has a spark.  You can t help                          but love this kid.                                       MILLER S MEN                          All watch Ryan run toward them.                                       JACKSON                          So, that s Ryan.                                       REIBEN                          Looks like a flaming asshole to me.                 Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the                barricade.  He salutes Miller.                                       REIBEN                          I m Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see                          me?                 Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he s finally                face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,                searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.                Miller Private, I ve got some bad news for you.  Your brothers                have been killed in action.                 The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.                Somehow he remains upright.                 Ryan All three?                                       MILLER                          Yes.                 Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning                him against some sandbags.                                       THE PARATROOPERS                          Are stunned at the news.  They look                          at Ryan, there s nothing else they                          can do.                                       MILLER S MEN                          Also look at Ryan, but then, one                          after another, they turn away,                          adverting their eyes, looking a their                          own boots, the debris on the bridge,                          the sky, anything other than Ryan.                                       MILLER                          We ve been sent to get you out of                          here.  You re going home.                 Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and                the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a                little room.                 Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.                                       MILLER                          Sergeant, we re moving out and I m                          taking you and your men with me.                 Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we re to hold this                bridge until we re relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-                ninth Division.                                       MILLER                          I m giving you new orders, Sergeant.                 Forrest Sir, you can t do that, these orders are from command.                                       MILLER                          I m not going to leave you and your                          men here to get killed.  Get them                          together, we re moving out.                 A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.                                       RYAN (O.S.)                          No, sir.                 They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about                to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting                him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on                the arm and speaks softly to him.                                       MILLER                          Come on, Private, you re going home.                 Ryan jerks away from Miller.                                       RYAN                          No, sir.                 All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.                                       MILLER                          Private.  I m sorry about your                          brothers but staying here and getting                          yourself killed isn t going to help.                                       RYAN                          Sir, if the Krauts are holding this                          bridge when division shows up, our                          guys are going to be sitting ducks.                                       MILLER                          This bridge cannot be held.  The                          Germans have two companies less than                          three miles from here.  They have                          tanks.                 That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,                but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I m still not going.                 Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.                                       MILLER                          Private, if you want to commit                          suicide, that s your choice, but                          you re going to have to wait until                          after I get you back to the beach.                          And you re not going to take these                          men with you.                 Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.                                       RYAN                          I m not leaving, sir.                 Miller starts to boil over.                                       MILLER                          The hell you aren t, you re comin                           with me if I have to drag you every                          inch of the way.  You hear me,                          Private?                                       RYAN                          I hear you sir, but I m not leaving.                 Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn t                resist.                                       MILLER                          Listen you little son-of-a-bitch                          you re coming with me or                          I ll...I ll...                 Ryan speaks softly.                                       RYAN                          What are you going to do, sir, shoot                          me?                 Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind                Miller.                                       REIBEN                               (politely)                          Uh, excuse me, Captain.                 Miller slowly turns and glares.                                       REIBEN                               (continuing)                          So, what are a few tanks, sir?                 Miller s more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles.                                       REIBEN                               (continuing)                          He s right, we can t shoot him...well,                          we could but we d get in an enormous                          amount of trouble.  And he s right                          about the bridge, it s a hell of a                          lot more important than he is.                 JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.                                       JACKSON                          Cap n...?                 Miller turns his glare on Jackson.                                       JACKSON                               (continuing)                          Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,                          here, to kill two birds with one                          stone.  Command seems to think keepin                           this boy alive is worth somethin .                          If we was to do that and hold this                          bridge, good chance we d get us a                          bucket full of medals.  I might even                          get me one  a them big, fancy ones                          like you got, so s I could sass any                          officer in the whole dang army, you                          included.                 Miller does a slow burn.                 UPHAM STEPS FORWARD                                       UPHAM                          I d like to stay, too, Captain.                                       MILLER                          You don t count.                 SARGE STEPS UP                                       SARGE                          I do and personally, I d rather get                          the hell out of here, but somebody s                          got to stay and take care of you and                          these pin-head privates of yours.                 Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.                 Forrest We weren t planning on going anywhere, sir.                 Reiben smiles.                                       REIBEN                          See, Captain?  The vote s unanimous.                 Miller s eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote?                What the hell are you talking about?  We don t vote.  This                isn t a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you                follow them.  We don t vote!                                       REIBEN                          Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely                          speaking hypothetically.  IF this                          was a voting situation, then the                          vote would have been unanimous.  But                          of course, it s not a voting                          situation, you re the captain, and                          you give the orders, sir.                                       MILLER                          You re goddamned right, I give the                          order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen                          to me, you little pissant pieces of                          shit, I am the ranking officer here                          and what I say goes, is that clear?                 They all quickly nod.                                       JACKSON                          Yes, sir.                                       REIBEN                          Of course, sir.                 All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.                 Miller looks from face to face.                                       MILLER                          In that case...                               (beat)                          I vote we stay.                 That s what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn t give them                time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.                                       MILLER                          Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson,                          get up on the bridgekeepers hut with                          your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and                          Upham move that machine gun so it                          can cover the left flank, it s                          worthless where it is.  Forrest, I                          want a full inventory of all your                          weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go.                 They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller                for a moment.                                       RYAN                          Thank you, sir.                                       MILLER                               (gruffly gentle)                          Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next                          to me, no matter where I go, you                          understand?                 Ryan salutes.                                       RYAN                          Yes, sir.                                       MILLER                          Alright, come with me.                 Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check                the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.                 EXT. BRIDGE - DAY                 Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other                paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.                 Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon                grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1 s, eight Tommy                guns and about sixty rounds per man.                                       MILLER                          That s it?                 Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.                                       REIBEN                          Sir, can I change my vote?                 Miller sighs, worried.                 EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER S HUT - DAY                 Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a                crescent of sandbags.  His eye is at his scope.  He FIRES.                                       A GERMAN SNIPER                          Falls from a window on the edge of                          town, dead.                                       UPHAM                          Sits beside Jackson with a pair of                          binoculars, searching for another                          target.  The German sniper fire has                          subsided for now.  Ext. bridge - day                          Miller watches as Ryan and several                          other paratroopers dig a series of                          trenches across the street, leading                          to the bridge.                 Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.                 Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head.  He speaks                to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.                                       MILLER                          Sarge, see what you can do to make                          those buildings inhospitable.                                       SARGE                          Yes, sir.                 Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE                DISTANCE.  They all turn at the sound.                                       UPHAM                          Eighty-eights, right?                 Miller nods.                                       UPHAM                          I can tell what the gunners had for                          dinner.                                       MILLER                          Those guns are close.                 Forrest Just south of town.  The Krauts have a two gun                emplacement, we saw it on the way in.  That s how we knew                they wanted the bridge intact, they didn t blow the crap out                of us.                                       MILLER                          Let s hope they don t change their                          mind.                 Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.                 INT. BUILDING - DAY                 Within sight of the bridge.  Sarge carefully plants a wire-                triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.  He                sets the wire, then carefully backs away.                 EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING                 Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine                gun nest.  Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham                at his side.                                       SARGE                          What do you think?                                       MILLER                          Well, if we had ten times the men                          and a lot more ammo, we might stand                          a chance, but not against those tanks.                                       SARGE                          What are we going to do?                                       MILLER                          We re going to hope like hell the                          tanks were on their way somewhere                          else.                                       REIBEN                          Maybe Caen.                                       MILLER                          Let s hope, because we re sure as                          hell not going to do any damage to                          them with what we have here.                                       UPHAM                          What about our grenades?                                       MILLER                          Those are Tigers, they have six-inch                          armor, they don t even notice                          grenades.                                       UPHAM                          Would they notice and eighty-eight?                                       MILLER                          Sure, you got one?                                       UPHAM                          The Germans do.                 Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.                                       MILLER                          Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are                          going hunting.                 Upham runs off.  Sarge shakes his head.                                       SARGE                          Uh, oh.                                       MILLER                          Out of the mouth of babes.                 EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT                 Dark.  Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with                blackening soot.  The rest of Miller s men and several                paratroopers, including Ryan, look on.  Upham is distressed.                Upham It was my idea, sir, you ve got to let me go.                                       MILLER                          Upham, you ve got to learn the                          difference between whining and                          griping.  You can t just rely on                          natural ability, you ve got to study                          and practice.                                       UPHAM                          But, sir...

MILLER                          See to it.                 RYAN Steps up to Miller.                                       RYAN                          I d like to go, sir.

REIBEN                          Aren t they the same thing, sir?                 Miller smiles.                                       MILLER                          Reiben, I don t know what I d do                          without you.

Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.                                       MILLER                          You ready?                 Forrest Yes, sir.

REIBEN                               (southern accent)                          Y all come back.                                       JACKSON                          Reiben, are you makin  fun  a the                          way I talk?                                       REIBEN                               (heavy southern accent)                          Hell, no!                 Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest                into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.                 EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT                 A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the                night.  It s eight-man crew re-loads.                                       IN THE DARKNESS                          A slight movement.  It s Miller.  He                          crawls to the edge of the emplacement                          and freezes in the shadows.                 A moment later he s joined by Forrest.  A moment after that,                Jackson silently crawls up to them.                                       MILLER                          Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a                          weakness.  There is none.  He motions                          to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The                          three of them settle into the                          darkness.                 EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT                 Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan                is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller s                men eye him.                                       SARGE                          Private, I m sorry about your                          brothers.                 Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip                from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was                the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?                                       SARGE                          Wade.                                       RYAN                          Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here                          to keep me alive...I never met                          him...he didn t know me from Adam,                          strange.  What was he like?                                       SARGE                          A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,                          here, used to call him a happy idiot.                                       REIBEN                          Like hell, I did.                                       RYAN                          My brothers would be mighty pissed                          off at me, if they knew I let some                          guy get killed trying to keep me                          alive.                                       SARGE                          You didn t let anybody get killed,                          you didn t even know we were coming                          up here.                                       RYAN                          Sure, I know, but...                               (sighs)                          Goddamn it all...                 The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan.                 EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT                 Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch.                                       A SHADOW                          It s Miller.  Easing through the                          darkness.  Closer to one of the                          sentries.                 Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller                nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the                sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS.                                       BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT                          Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.                                       A GERMAN SENTRY                          Approaches.  He sees Forrest.  Just                          as he s about to open up with his                          sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him                          from behind, STABS him, eases the                          body silently to the ground.                                       MILLER AND JACKSON                          Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.                 Together they attach the eighty-eight s carriage to the                German s truck.                                       ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY                          Rounds a corner.  Sees them.  OPENS                          UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.                 Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.                                       OTHER GERMANS                          Race over, FIRING.                                       JACKSON                          Covering them, OPENS UP.  Kills the                          advancing Germans.                 MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.                 FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.                 JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.                 Spins.                 Still FIRING.                 Giving Miller cover.                 MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.                 JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.                 JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.                                       THE WINDSHIELD                          Is shattered by bullets.                 Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.                                       FORREST                          In the back of the truck.                 Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.                 MILLER FLOORS IT.                 The truck DRIVES through the Germans.                 The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.                MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.                 The Germans FIRING after them.                 EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT                 Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a                gauntlet of Germans.  As they approach the bridge, the other                American s FIRE COVER for them.                 Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.                 SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS                 THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the                barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.                                       MILLER                          RYAN!  GET BACK THERE!                 Ryan ignores him.  They get the eighty-eight safely behind                the barricade.  Miller grabs Ryan.                                       RYAN                          Sorry, sir.                 Miller fumes.  he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,                clearly not pissed at Ryan.                                       MILLER                          Don t do that again.                                       RYAN                          I won t need to sir, it s already                          here, behind the barricade so...                 Miller GROWLS.                                       RYAN                          Yes, sir.                 Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.                 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                 Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine.  Very                gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.                 EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT                 Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt.  They cover it and                step back carefully.                 Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their                tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they ll                place the rest of the mines.                 EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT                 Quiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There s nothing to do                now but wait.                 ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT                 Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see                Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning                the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.                                       REIBEN                          What do you think?                                       JACKSON                          I think I m we got that eighty-eight.                                       REIBEN                          I mean, Ryan, what do you think of                          him?                 Jackson shrugs.                                       JACKSON                          He ain t half-bad, I guess.                                       REIBEN                          I guess.                 They re quiet for a moment.                                       JACKSON                          He ain t Wade.                                       REIBEN                          Nope, he ain t Wade.                 Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.                                       MILLER                          Crouch-runs through the shadows and                          stops at the bridgekeepers hut.                                       MILLER                          Reiben...                 Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun                nest.                                       REIBEN                          Yes, sir.                 REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.                 MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in                the rear machine gun nest.                                       MILLER                          You set?  Sarge nods.                                       RYAN                          Yes, sir.                 Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to                check the others.                 EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN                 First light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE                them in their positions:                                       REIBEN AND UPHAM                          Manning the forward machine gun nest.

FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS                 Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward                and the rear machine gun nests.                                       RYAN AND SARGE                          Manning rear machine gun.                                       MILLER                          At the bridgehead, waiting.                 SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD                 All eyes turn.                 SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER                 Dashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant.                Then another.  And another.                                       MILLER                          Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down                          behind some sandbags.                                       MILLER                          HERE THEY COME!                 A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

THE GERMANS                          At least fifty of them, advancing on                          the bridge.  Running from cover to                          cover.  A squad pushing a French                          truck, using it as a shield.                                       JACKSON                          Calmly picking off the attacking                          Germans.                                       THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN                          Make their way down the streets.                          Along the riverbank.  Through the                          houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING                          from all directions.                 REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.                                       MILLER                          Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.                          Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.                                       REIBEN AND UPHAM                          Running out of ammo.  See that there s                          nothing else they can do.                                       REIBEN                          Time to go.                 Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.                Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as                they can.                 THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER                 REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.                Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.                 They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.                 DIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them.                                       RYAN IS FIRING                          With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops                          several Germans.                                       GERMANS EVERYWHERE                          They swarm over the first barricade.                                       MILLER                          FIRES A BURST into a German s belly.                          HITS another with the stock of his                          Thompson.                 HAND-TO-HAND.                 FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS                 FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don t see a                flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of                the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE                PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late.                 THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER                PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE                 No time to react.                                       HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING                          Half a dozen Germans break through.                 Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.                                       RYAN                          Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES.                          KILLS the German.                                       MILLER                          Struggling with a pair of Germans.                                       JACKSON                          FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on                          Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open                          Miller s face with bits of skull.                                       RYAN                          Leaps onto the final German attacking                          Miller.  That German raises his rifle                          on Ryan.                 UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON                 All see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.                                       THE STUNNED GERMAN                          About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by                          bullets from three directions.                                       UPHAM                          I got him.                                       REIBEN                          Like hell you did, I got him.                                       JACKSON SMILES                          He got him.                 MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four                Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben                and Upham:                                       MILLER                          BACK!  LET S GO!                 They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make                it to the barricade.                                       SARGE                          Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves                          Ryan firing the rear machine gun.                          Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING                          COVER.  Exposed.                                       BULLETS EVERYWHERE                          MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the                          barricade.  Dive over.                                       SARGE                          Sees they ve made it.  FIRES A FINAL                          BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of                          bullets right behind him.                 THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they re worth.  Trying to                cover Sarge.  Too many Germans.                 SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.  MILLER AND THE OTHERS                continue to fire, horrified.                 SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET                 Cradling the B.A.R.  Stumbling toward cover.  Slowing.                Bleeding.                                       THE AMERICANS                          Desperately trying to cover him.                                       THE GERMANS                          Open up with a volley.                                       SARGE                          Is almost there.                 ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE                 As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It s not enough.                                       SARGE                          Five feet from the sandbags, his                          back is TORN APART by Germans fire.                          He looks down, stunned at his chest.                          Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An                          instant of surprise, more than fear.                 He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls                onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.                THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY                                       THE GERMANS                          Who killed Sarge are killed.  The                          others back off for now.                 REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.                                       MILLER                          Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the                          barricade.  Sees that he s dead.                 THE GERMANS RETREAT.                 Around the corner.                                       MILLER                          Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling                          next to him.                                       THE OTHERS                          Watch, start to gather.                                       REIBEN                          Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn                          it...                                       MILLER                          Get back to your positions!                 They hesitate.                                       MILLER                          Go!                 They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn t move.                He can t take his eyes off Sarge.                                       MILLER                          Doesn t move.  He just stares at                          Sarge s body.                                       RYAN                          Looks at Miller, sees him growing                          weak, starting to sway.  He gently                          tries to move Miller aside.                                       RYAN                          I ll take care of Sarge...                 Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge s body.  Miller                grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made                as he kneeled over Wade s body.                                       MILLER                          Sarge?  Who s Sarge?                 But this time it doesn t work.  He can t make it stick.  The                hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He s                called his own bluff.                 EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT                 Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once.                 Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have                tightened their perimeter.                 Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.                 They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.                 Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:                                       MILLER                          English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.                 Slowly, Miller s men turn to him.                                       UPHAM                          What d you say, Captain?

REIBEN                          Well, I ll be goddamned, I knew it.                                       JACKSON                          Like hell, you did.

REIBEN                          What deal?                                       MILLER                          I coach the baseball team, too.

UPHAM                          Forget it.                 They all sit in silence.                                       MILLER                          You know that cruise ship Wade s                          grandfather was on?                 They all nod, except Ryan who doesn t know what Miller s                talking about.                                       MILLER                               (continuing)                          I wonder if his cabin is still                          available?                                       REIBEN                          That s not where I am.  Miller No?                          Where are you?                                       REIBEN                          I m in a dressing room with Mrs.                          Rachel Troubowitz, our super s wife.                          She s an easy forty-four, double E,                          but I ve convinced her she s a thirty-                          eight D and I m watching her try and                          squeeze herself into a side-stay,                          silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle                          with s Helf-lift brassiere.                               (smiles)                          She s having a devil of a time,                          getting into that thing.                 They all share Reiben s dream for a moment.  Then Jackson                smiles.                                       JACKSON                          Me?  I m walking with my hound, Lucy,                          it s about an hour  fore sunrise and                          we re out huntin  coon.  I got me a                          flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...                                       REIBEN                          Jackson, how many times I got to                          tell you, you re from Tennessee.                                       JACKSON                          I am, but I like imported whiskey.                          So there I am and I hear the biggest                          ole  coon you ever did hear,  a                          rustlin  right there in front of me.                          That ole  boy comes right out of the                          brush, I got a clear shot and he                          knows he s  bout to meet his maker.                          I aim, I got my finger tight on the                          trigger and then I just smile and                          say to that ole  coon, go on, now,                          you get out  a here.  Then I sit                          down on a hollow log and take me a                          right long pull a  that mash whiskey.                 Upham smiles.                                       UPHAM                          I don t know, I kind of like Wade s                          idea about the cruise ship.  I ve                          never been to Tahiti.                                       REIBEN                          What about you, Captain?                 Miller smiles.  He knows exactly where he is.                                       MILLER                          I m in my backyard, lying in my                          hammock, with my arm around my wife,                          listening for the sound of breaking                          glass.                                       JACKSON                          Say what, Cap n?                                       MILLER                          You see, I ve got the best house in                          all of Addley.  It s not the biggest                          house, but it s got the best location,                          right next to the junior high baseball                          field.  The garage windows face left                          field.  The guy who owned the house                          before me had these heavy screen S                          put over them.  The first thing I                          did when I bought the place was take                          off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-                          two yards from home plate to my garage                          windows.  It takes a hell of a junior                          high kid to hit a ball that far.  I                          look at my garage windows as a                          Motivator and a way to scout the                          kids coming up, the ones who are                          going to give us a shot at the state                          championship.  I lay there in my                          hammock and every time I hear the                          sound of breaking glass, I know we re                          one step closer to winning it all.                                       JACKSON                          Don t that get kind of expensive,                          Cap n?                                       MILLER                          It s worth it.                                       JACKSON                          To each, his own.                 They re all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.                                       MILLER                          How about you, James?                 Ryan sighs.                                       RYAN                          I m home, playing basketball with my                          brothers, it s evenin  time, we re                          trying  to get in a few more points                          before it s too dark to see the ball.                          That s where I am.                 They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes                it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all                eat in silence.                 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN                 First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.                A SOUND.  Louder.

Sees:                 THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN                                       MILLER                          Here they come.

THE GERMANS KEEP COMING                 Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.                                       MILLER                          Manning the forward machine gun.                          Way out front.  Sees that he s going                          to be cut off.  He grabs the hot                          gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.                          He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK                          toward the bridge.                 HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY                BULLETS.

They re everywhere.                                       THREE GERMANS                          Break through the perimeter.                 RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.                                       REIBEN                          Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one                          German.  STABS the other.                 RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt.                 REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE                GUN.                 OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A                LONG BURST.  Germans drop.                                       MILLER                          FIRES again.  More Germans drop.                                       THE GERMANS                          Take positions in the building near                          the bridge.                 They start working their way to the tops of the nearby                buildings.                 Making their way along the riverbanks.                                       REIBEN AND RYAN                          Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding                          the ammo belt.

He                          grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS                          toward Reiben and Ryan.                 SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM                 OPEN UP on him.                 BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He s outrunning them.  Almost there.

Falls on the                          sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the                          ammo.  UPHAM S DEAD.                 RYAN STUNNED.                 For just a micro-second.

He hears the                          RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.                                       MILLER                          TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME!                                       RYAN AND REIBEN                          Immediately grab the machine gun and                          ammo and race back to the rear nest.                 Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST                TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two                German infantry platoons.                                       JACKSON                          On the bridgekeeper s hut.

THE LAST GERMAN TANK                 Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.                Ready to blow him to bits.                                       MILLER                          Is almost there.  He arms the satchel                          charge.                 THE TIGER S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.                 BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS                                       MILLER                          Throws the satchel charge under the                          tank.  Rolls off the edge of the                          bridge.  Lands on the embankment                          below.                 THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES                 MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.                 Almost out of ammo.                 MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,                hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.                                       MILLER                          HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!                 Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.                 A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they ve heard                yet.                                       MILLER                          Goddamn it!                                       REIBEN                          More tanks...  Ryan Lot s of them                          The fear on their faces turns to                          resignation.  They know that they                          are dead men.  They settle into their                          positions, and prepare to fire and                          die.                 They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.                 THEN MILLER S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a                smile...then a real smile...                 AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then                ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...                 MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN                 Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along                with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.                 They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after                wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a                few among the departing Germans.                                       THE ADVANCING TROOPS                          Run onto the bridge and start to                          secure the position.  A SERGEANT and                          a few of HIS MEN look around,                          curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and                          Ryan, battered and bloody, standing                          among the bodies.                 A MAJOR strides up.                 Major Report, Captain.                                       MILLER                          Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,                          that s Private Richard Reiben and                          that s Private James Ryan, Hundred-                          and-First Airborne.                 The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.                                       SERGEANT                          Ryan?                 One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.                 Soldier That s him, that s Ryan.                 The Major puts his hand on Ryan s shoulder.                 Major Command is looking for you, son.  You re going home.                 Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.                 EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY                 American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the                road and over the bridge.                 MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN                 Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies                of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers                are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.                 Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if                they don t want to risk him being bumped into or run over by                any of the advancing troops or vehicles.                                       MILLER                          Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down                          next to Sarge and looks at him for a                          long moment.  Then, with a steady                          hand, he takes one of Sarge s two                          dog-tags.  Then he does the same to                          Jackson and Upham.                 REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.                                       MILLER                          Stands and walks back to Reiben and                          Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan                          who grips them tightly and nods in                          thanks.                 Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then                he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let s move out.                 Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller                down the road, away from the bridge.                                       CAMERA CRANES UP                          The three dirty, bloodied, tired men                          walk down the road, ignored by the                          fresh troops marching in the opposite                          direction.                                       RYAN                          Captain?                                       MILLER                          Yes, Private.                                       RYAN                          Upham and Jackson, what were they                          like?                                       MILLER                          Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was                          writing a book.                                       RYAN                          Yeah?                                       REIBEN                          Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the                          220 in twenty-four-five.                                       RYAN                          No kidding.                                       MILLER                          Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,                          he was going to be a preacher, his                          father and uncles have a traveling                          ministry out of the back of a stretch                          Hudson.                                       RYAN                          And Sarge?                                       MILLER                          Sarge?                               (beat)                          He was the best friend I ever had.                               (smiles)                          Lemme tell you about Sarge...                 They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds                and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the                road and over the bridge.                 Fade out.                 THE END -                 --------------------------------------------------------------  ',\n",

LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH \\x96 DAY                 Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading:  THIS IS                 WHERE IT IS \\x96 PARALLEL 38.  Below these words, arrows point                 to  NORTH KOREA  in one direction,  SOUTH KOREA  in opposite                 one. Two Air Rescue helicopters are coming in low from the                 north, descending to a point just outside the entrance to                 the hospital Admitting Ward.                 Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze goes                 from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can                 read at first are the very large letters:  M-A-S-H.  Moving                 closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can                 make out the rest of the sign. Above the four large letters                 it says:  4077TH,  and then we see there is the remainder of                 a word following each of the large letters, but in much                 smaller print, so that  M-A-S-H  becomes  Mobile Army Surgical                 Hospital.  The helicopters land and enlisted men of the U.S.                 Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from each into                 the Admitting Ward.                 LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the                 Medical Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watches                 grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into                 his hospital. CORPORAL  RADAR  O REILLY, with a long thin                 neck, large ears and a knack for anticipating his Colonel s                 wishes, moves up close behind him.

The Corporal s head is turning back and                 forth like an actual radar receiver, monitoring the northern                 horizon where the valley of a river meanders between                 mountainous ridges.

You think he ll finally break down                           and give us two more surgeons?                 The DISTANT SOUND of more HELICOPTERS becomes faintly audible                 to the normal human ear, and a moment later one appears over                 a ridge.

MOTOR POOL AND RAILROAD DEPOT \\x96 325TH EVACUATION                 HOSPITAL \\x96 YONG-DONG-PA \\x96 DAY                 Two officers come from opposite directions toward a Jeep,                 each carrying a Valpac and trailing a barracks bag. Though                 they still wear such later-to-be-discarded refinements as                 captain s bars on their caps and overcoats, they are far                 from West Point standards in dress and manner. DUKE, 29, is                 still solidly built like the fullback he once was. HAWKEYE,                 28, a former end, is taller and rangier, wears glasses. Their                 accents, Georgia and Maine respectively, are in sharp                 contrast. A MOTOR POOL SARGEANT who has driven the Jeep up                 climbs out.

DUKE                          Duke Forrest.                 Hawkeye takes the driver s seat. Duke, getting into the right-                hand side, has no objection, just a question.                                       DUKE                          You got directions?                                       HAWKEYE                          Ayuh, only it s early, I need a drink                           to wake me up.                                       DUKE                          I got some.                 He turns around and opens his barracks bag, where he finds a                 pint bottle conveniently located near the top.                                       HAWKEYE                          Make it yourself, or is it real?                                       DUKE                          Georgia, where I come from, it s                           real if you make it yourself. But I                           been buying from the Yankee Government                           since they put me in this soldier                           suit and give me a rate.                                       HAWKEYE                          Tax-free booze. It s about all you                           can say for army life.                                       DUKE                               (passing bottle)                          Where you from with that crazy way                           of talking?                                       HAWKEYE                          Crabapple Cove. Maine.                                       DUKE                          Damn! That must be about as far north                           as you can get.                                       HAWKEYE                          Pretty near. What do you know about                           the outfit we re going to?                                       DUKE                          C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant                           Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of                           them regular army clowns. Push you                           around so it s hard to get any decent                           work done.                                       HAWKEYE                          We got to head them off, right at                           the start. Push them around first.                 They have exchanged the bottle a couple of times. In the act                 of raising it to his mouth, Hawkeye looks toward the hospital                 doorway.                                       HAWKEYE                          I think we already caught their eye.                 Two MPs have emerged from the hospital administration offices                 and are heading toward them. Hawkeye goes into action quickly,                 starting the Jeep engine.                                       DUKE                          What s the initials  MP  stand for,                           Hawkeye?                                       HAWKEYE                          Shore Patrol, Duke. Let s go!                 The Jeep starts off at its maximum takeoff speed and                 accelerates dangerously as it careens out of the hospital                 grounds.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. ROAD NEAR OUIJONGBU \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye and Duke are driving the Jeep along the muddy road \\x96                 they come upon a sign which fills a large part of the screen:                  Last chance before Peking . A short distance behind the                 sign, it is now revealed are three parked U.S. Army trucks,                 in front of which parades a group of Korean prostitutes from                 fourteen to forty-five.                 Despite the autumn weather, their costumes, mixed American                 mail order and Korean, are chosen for seductive appeal rather                 than warmth.                                       HAWKEYE                          Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore                           \\x96                               (pronounced  howah )                          House. You in the market Duke?                                       DUKE                               (in negation)                          I done my shopping in Seoul last                           night.                 They now have a fairly clear view of a GI and a Korean female                 lying in tight formation in the bed on one of the trucks,                 their activity only partially concealed by a blanket.                                       DUKE                          Curb service is right.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. APPROACH TO 4077TH MASH \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye stops the Jeep as they come to a place in the road                 where they can get a downward look at their future home. The                 river valley in which the 4077th Mash is situated is almost                 surrounded by mountains. The components of the post are spread                 out in a rough horseshoe with a large compound of level ground                 in the middle. At the closed end of the horseshoe is the                 main hospital building, made of wood with a tin roof marked                 by a large red cross; everything else is canvas. To the left                 of the main building are strung out the Admitting Ward,                 Laboratory, Dental Clinic, Mess Hall, PX, Showers Tent, Barber                 Tent and the Enlisted Men s Tents. On the right side are the                 Postop Ward, Officers  Tents, Nurses  Tents, Korean Domestics                  Tents and finally, the Officers  Club. In the f.g., from                 Duke and Hawkeye s angle are four helicopters belonging to                 the 5th Air Rescue Squadron, and the signs we have already                 seen marking the post and the 38th Parallel.                                       HAWKEYE                          Well, there it is. Jesus!                                       DUKE                          The spot we picked to spend the                           winter. Maybe we ought to look a                           little harder.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. MASH MESS HALL \\x96 DAY                 As Hawkeye and Duke enter. The large tent has two floor levels                 separated by a railing into a section for officers and one                 for enlisted men, the two groups being much closer to                 numerical equality here than in an ordinary military                 installation. There is a further voluntary piece of                 segregation within the officers  section: the men \\x96 medical                 officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a                 helicopter pilot \\x96 are at one long, rectangular table; the                 nurses, ranging in rank from second lieutenant to captain,                 at another.                 Hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the                 officers  section, but Duke calls his attention to the                 outstanding feature of the nurses  table: LIEUTENANT DISH,                 24, blonde and clearly, even in her winter fatigues, the                 sexiest looking nurse in military history.                                       DUKE                          What do you think of that piece of                           scenery, Yankee boy?                                       HAWKEYE                          Finest kind. We ll sit where we can                           get the best view.                 Accordingly, they select seats close to the nurses and facing                 the Lieutenant. Some personnel are on duty in the hospital                 during this lunch period, but beside Dish, two of the                 following three nurses with whom we will become acquainted                 are present here:                 KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly                 built, very strong and very competent in her job; LESLIE,                 also a captain, not more than thirty, bright, attractive,                 cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent male                 matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as                 inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of the post; and                 LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can t match Dish or Leslie by physical                 standards but has the asset of instant availability.                 A Korean boy, not yet of military age, in green fatigue pants                 and an off-white coat, appears promptly and heaps Duke and                 Hawkeye s plates with food. Duke is hungry enough to turn                 his whole attention to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to                 keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish while eating. Thus neither                 of them is aware of the attention they are getting from the                 male officers  group, which includes HENRY, a couple of                 medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI; DAGO RED                 (officially, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, red-haired Catholic                 Chaplain of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walter                 Zaldowski, Dental Officer), both in their thirties; and                 CAPTAIN UGLY JOHN BLACK, an Australian anesthesiologist.                 There is also curiosity about the newcomers from the unlisted                 men s section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER,                 Henry s overweight Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young,                 black and fresh from Mississippi; PRIVATE BOONE, who looks                 too young and nervous to be in any man s army; and PFC                 SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him                 halfway around the world.                 Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by                 Duke and Hawkeye s unmilitary behavior, gets up and crosses                 to where they are sitting.                                       HENRY                          I m Colonel Blake. You fellows just                           passing through?                                       HAWKEYE                          Nope, we re assigned heah.                 With which reminder we will abandon all indications of the                 Maine accent.                                       DUKE                          Y all were short a couple cutters                           and we re what the Army sent.                                       HENRY                          Don t you know the first thing you re                           supposed to do at a new post is                           present yourself to the commanding                           officer with your orders?                                       DUKE                          Reckon so, but we been boozing all                           day and you work up an appetite.                                       HENRY                               (taking out orders                                and handing Duke a                                copy)                          You re welcome to one of these,                           whatever they are.

Henry scans both papers to find what he considers the most                 important part. There is a RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY in the                 distance.                                       HENRY                          Good. You ve both been working close                           to the front.                                       DUKE                               (listening to artillery)                          Never this close.                                       HENRY                          They ve hit us on Cherry Hill. I                           just got word. We have our slack                           periods but when the action starts,                           you ll have more work in twelve hours                           than a civilian surgeon does in a                           week.                                       HAWKEYE                          Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye                           and Duke are here.                                       DUKE                               (to Henry)                          That s right, pal. You just sit up                           front and sign the mail, and leave                           the cutting to us.                                       HENRY                          I may need you to go to work                           practically immediately. But meanwhile                           perhaps you d like to meet some of                           your fellow officers.                                       DUKE                          Just one for a start.                                       HAWKEYE                          The blonde dish.                                       HENRY                          If you mean...                               (looking toward                                Lieutenant Dish)                          She is a lieutenant in the Army                           Nursing Corps, Captain.                                       HAWKEYE                          Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she s                           already... involved with somebody                           here.                                       HENRY                          They ve all tried. Nobody s got to                           first base.                 He is interrupted by the fact that Dish and Knocko have risen                 from their table and are passing right by them on their way                 to the door.                 The Lieutenant has just as nice a walk as you would hope                 for, and the men s eyes follow her till she is again out of                 hearing distance.                                       HAWKEYE                          Why bother with first base? I d go                           right for the home run.

Before his name is uttered, Radar has already risen from the                 enlisted men s group, and is now at Henry s side.                                       RADAR                          Sir?                                       HENRY                          Don t do that, Radar! You make me                           nervous.                                       RADAR                          Sir?                                       HENRY                          Don t come so quickly when I call. I                           want you to take these officers...                                       RADAR                          To Major Burns  tent. Yes, sir.                                       HENRY                          Stop that, O Rielly!

RADAR                          Yes, Colonel.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. / INT.  THE SWAMP  (PRESENTLY FRANK S TENT) \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye and Duke drag their bags from the Jeep, which Radar                 drives away. They look over their new residence, a standard                 army tent, square with peaked roof, a wooden door attached                 to the canvas. Then as they approach it, they become aware                 of a youthful Korean voice reading, in heavily accented                 English, words that have no meaning for the speaker.                                       HO-JON S VOICE (O.S.)                           Yea, though I walk through the valley                           of the shadow of death...                                         DUKE                          Jesus Christ!                                       HAWKEYE                          One of his ancestors, I think.                                       HO-JON S VOICE (O.S.)                           I shall fear no evil for Thou art                           with me...                  They open the door of the tent and go in. There are three                 canvas cots with sleeping bags on them, a plank floor, an                 oil stove, electric light, a few crude shelves, one table                 and one chair plus assorted crates serving as same.                 MAJOR FRANK BURNS, 35, from Wisconsin, is sitting on one of                 the two more favorably situated cots listening to HO-JON, a                 Korean boy of 16, read from the Bible. He corrects the word                 that has given Ho-Jon the most trouble.                                       FRANK                          Thou. For Thou art with me.                               (sees Duke and Hawkeye,                                jumps up)                          Welcome, welcome, welcome!                                       DUKE                          What the hell s going on here?                                       FRANK                          This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our                           houseboy. I m teaching him English.                                       DUKE                          Where s he gonna use that kind of                           talk?  The valley of the shadow of                           death.  Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...                               (rummages in barracks                                bag)                          I got something for you.                 He takes out sex magazine, gives it to Ho-Jon in such a way                 that we see the nude on the cover, but Frank doesn t.                                       DUKE                               (to Frank)                          Little light reading matter. Just                           right for his age.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Duke)                          Well, southern boy, I suppose you                           want the sack that s convenient to                           the door.                                       DUKE                          And gets the wind every time it opens.                           No, thanks. I ll take that one.                 He indicates the unoccupied cot which, like Frank s, is at                 the rear of the tent with the stove between it and the front                 door. Hawkeye shrugs and reaches into his barracks bag.                                       HAWKEYE                          Let s choose for it.                               (finds baseball bat,                                hands it to Duke)                          You toss.                 Duke tosses the bat vertically in the air. As it comes down                 Hawkeye grabs it expertly at the tape with his left hand.                 Duke puts his left hand above that, and Duke is left with                 his right hand waving in the air with nothing to grab.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Ho-Jon)                          Part of your education. Always use                           your own bat.                 He tosses Valpac onto the desired cot.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. ADMITTING WARD \\x96 NIGHT                 It s pretty full already and more wounded are being brought                 in by corpsmen. In contrast to the opening scene, where the                 casualties were a generalized fact seen at a distance, in                 this scene they are viewed individually and at close range,                 and the effect, both on the eye and the ear, is almost                 unbearable. Hawkeye, in a white gown as are all the surgeons                 and nurses, moves from a patient he has just examined to one                 who is letting out a number of unintelligible SOUNDS mixed                 in with such clear and frequently repeated words as  Christ,                   Mother,   God damn  and  Please.  As Hawkeye approaches,                 Lieutenant Scorch removes enough of the bandaging done in                 the field to display an abdomen with part of its contents on                 the outside.                                       HAWKEYE                          Two-man job. How much blood has he                           had?                                       LIEUTENANT SCORCH                          Second pint.                                       HAWKEYE                          Duke...                 Duke has just examined a patient. He takes a step towards                 Hawkeye.                                       HAWKEYE                          This kid s ready but we won t know                           all the damage till we get in and                           see what s happened. What have you                           got?                                       DUKE                          Nothing can t wait. Shall we check                           it out with the Major?                 He indicates a Major who is standing a short distance away,                 looking like a boss but not actually doing anything. Also in                 Admitting Ward are, Murrhardt, Lieutenant Dish, PFC Seidman,                 Corporal Judson.                                       HAWKEYE                          Naw, I already found out. The only                           thing he doesn t like about being in                           charge is making decisions.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 NOTE: All principal cast should be available for all operating                 scenes.                 There are three operations going on at once. Here all                 personnel wear white caps and masks and it is hard to identify                 individuals except that at close range we can distinguish                 Hawkeye by his glasses and Duke by his eyes and his build.                 They are working together with great efficiency and an                 instinctive collaboration that seems to require no verbal                 exchange. What we see them do, without necessarily recognizing                 the portion of anatomy involved, is to cut out a section of                 bowel damaged by a shell fragment, and start sewing the                 divided ends together.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye and Duke are working together on the last stages of                 a leg amputation. This time there is no doubt about the                 surgical process we are watching; we see the almost severed                 leg and the process of controlling bleeding; then the limb                 is actually separated from its stump and handed by Duke to a                 corpsman. Hawkeye speaks to the nurse standing behind him.                                       HAWKEYE                          Hot pack.                 Watching her dip the pack into a warm solution and wring it                 out, he recognizes, despite cap and mask, that it is                 Lieutenant Dish. His eyes linger on hers for a brief moment.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Lieutenant Dish comes out of the Operating Room, tears in                 her eyes, trying to control her sobs, and moves just outside                 the circle of light from the fixture over the entrance. There,                 no longer under observation, she lets herself cry. Hawkeye                 comes out the door, registers surprise at the sight of her                 just as if he hadn t followed her out. He moves to her side                 and puts a comforting arm around her.                 She looks up just long enough to see who it is, then buries                 her head on his shoulder as his other arm goes around her.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Isn t this ridiculous, Doctor? Six                           months I ve been here and there are                           still times when I can t stand it. I                           just go to pieces.                                       HAWKEYE                          There s nothing ridiculous about it.                               (turns her face up to                                his)                          A kid like you...                 She doesn t move her head from the way he has arranged it,                 and her lips are very close to his. He kisses her and it                 turns out, from the ardent way she responds, that s what she                 wanted him to do.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Thank you, Captain Pierce.                               (her voice full of                                need)                          It s been so long.                                       HAWKEYE                          No trouble at all.                               (then)                          Hawkeye.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          How did you get called that?                                       HAWKEYE                           The Last of the Mohicans.  Only                           book my father ever read.                 He kisses her again and again she clings to him.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You re getting a workout, you and                           Captain Forrest, your first night.                                       HAWKEYE                          It isn t always this rough?                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Oh, no. We have dull stretches every                           week or so, thank God, when there s                           nothing to do after midnight.                                       HAWKEYE                          They don t have to be dull. I mean                           if you and me put our minds                           together...                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Our minds?                                       HAWKEYE                          For a start. I just have a hunch...                           well, it isn t entirely a hunch...                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You re an attractive man.                                       HAWKEYE                          You have a certain modest charm                           yourself.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                               (continuing her own                                thoughts)                          But I m married.                                       HAWKEYE                          Something else we have in common.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Very happily married.                                       HAWKEYE                          Same here.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          And absolutely determined to be                           faithful to my husband. Do we have                           that in common, Captain?                                       HAWKEYE                          It s a matter of definition. Faithful                           in spirit, yes.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          I don t make the distinction. But                           the sex urge is a powerful force. In                           women just as much as men.                                       HAWKEYE                          Ayuh.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You d think now, with only six weeks                           before they ship me back home, it                           would be easier. But it isn t.                                       HAWKEYE                          Of course not.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          It s terribly hard. Sometimes the                           temptation is just too much.                                       HAWKEYE                          Then why not, as long as it wouldn t                           hurt anybody...?                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                               (not hearing him,                                just continuing her                                own thought)                          But you ve made me feel strong again,                           Captain. Hawkeye.                               (smiling, tears gone,                                ready to return to                                work)                          You helped me pull together when I                           needed it.                 With a grateful look at him, she goes back inside. Hawkeye                 contemplates the accomplishment she has credited him with,                 and finds it appalling.                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye and Duke are working across the table from each other                 again, this time inside a man s chest, stopping a hemorrhage                 and debriding the wound.                                       DUKE                          Now that s what I call real pretty.                           We can close up here and go into his                           belly.                                       HAWKEYE                          He can t take much more time on the                           table.                                       DUKE                          So we got to cut him fast. I figure                           from the X-ray it ain t just the                           spleen. We also got to snatch his                           right kidney.                 EXT. MASH COMPOUND \\x96 MORNING                 Wearing fatigues now, Hawkeye and Duke are making their weary                 way from the hospital to their tent after a night s work.                 There is an announcement coming over the post-wide public                 address system, but it doesn t concern them.

THE SWAMP \\x96 MORNING                 Ho-Jon throws a match into the oil stove, but it doesn t                 work. He looks into it, strikes another match, and this time                 it lights up so quickly he is almost singed by the flame.                 Hawkeye and Duke open the door and come in. Ho-Jon straightens                 and bows.                                       HO-JON                          Good morning, Captain Pierce and                           Captain Forrest.

He and Duke remove their outer clothing during the ensuing:                                       HO-JON                          Because is not democrash?

He gives Ho-Jon two bottles. The boy looks at the labels.                                       HO-JON                          Gin. I know, yes.

He is so disturbed he fails to shut the door.                                       FRANK                          Is that liquor?

Duke and Hawkeye settle back to enjoy their                 drinks but they both come bolt upright when they see Frank                 drop to his knees by his cot and begin to intone the Lord s                 Prayer.

Hawkeye and Duke find it hard to believe their eyes and ears.                 They never expected to see a grown man behaving as Frank is                 now.

Radar O Reilly comes in with  Emergency  written all over                 his expressive face.

Two choppers and three ambulances                           full.                 This is the most serious kind of crisis for the outfit, and                 Henry s expression shows it.

Duke gets to his feet and Hawkeye makes a                 preliminary move toward doing so.                                       HAWKEYE                          About that chest-cutter...                                       HENRY                          I ll try, d-d-dammit!

MASH COMPOUND \\x96 DUSK                 Hawkeye and Lieutenant Dish are walking close together in an                 otherwise deserted area.                                       HAWKEYE                          Cold?                 He puts an arm around her without waiting for an answer. She                 smiles at him fondly.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Even if I weren t.                                       HAWKEYE                          Maria...                 He kisses her and they cling together, standing outside a                 tent identified by a sign:  OFFICER S CLUB.                                        LIEUTENANT DISH                          Oh, Hawkeye, I don t think I could                           stick it out these next few weeks                           without you.                 Hawkeye opens the door of the Officers  Club, looks in.                                       HAWKEYE                          Nobody here.                 He steps aside to let her precede him in. There is nothing                 inside except a pool table. She hesitates. He takes her in                 his arms again, this time pressing his hands against the                 seat of her fatigue pants.

HO-JON                          Captain Pierces...                 Hawkeye lets go of her, and they try to look like innocent                 strollers.                                       HAWKEYE                          Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin ?                                       HO-JON                          Finest kind. Captain Forrests say                           you better haul ass home quick. We                           got new chest-cutter in our tent.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. THE SWAMP \\x96 DUSK                 The wooden front of the tent has a new sign identifying it                 as  THE SWAMP.                  INT. THE SWAMP \\x96 DUSK                 First we see Hawkeye sitting on his cot, looking across the                 tent at the newcomer. Attached to the canvas wall behind him                 is a photograph of his wife and two sons, aged four and two.                 Next we turn our attention to Duke on the adjoining cot                 (formerly Frank s). He also has a family picture on display:                 his wife, two-year-old daughter and an infant. Then we get                 our first glimpse of TRAPPER JOHN, their new tentmate, about                 30, tall and very thin, his head pretty well hidden inside                 the hood of a parka. He is using cellophane tape to install                 one of the popular nude photos of the day (such as the one                 of Marilyn Monroe that circulated so widely in the early                 1950 s).                 Completing the group is Ho-Jon, who sits on the floor,                 silently taking in everything that is done or said.                 Finished with his decorating effort, Trapper reaches into                 the depths of his parka to produce a can of beer. He digs                 into the other side, finds an opener and opens the beer.                 Then his head goes back inside the parka along with the can                 as he takes a swig from it.                                       DUKE                               (to Hawkeye)                          Now I got you for a witness, I m                           going to try again. So far all I                           dragged out of him is he s from                           Bahston and he s only been in the                           Army two months.

(to Trapper)                          Haven t I?                                       TRAPPER                          If you don t know what you ve seen,                           why should I?                 Hawkeye is unsatisfied. He keeps staring at Trapper, sure                 he s seen him before.                                       DUKE                               (to Trapper)                          You ready to switch to a little tonic                           we generally take us about this time?                           Ho-Jon...                 Ho-Jon goes to the table and takes a few ice cubes from a                 hospital ice-bag, puts them into the pitcher along with gin                 and a dash of vermouth.                                       TRAPPER                          Don t you use olives?                                       DUKE                          Where you think you are, boy? They                           probably never seen a olive in this                           country.                 Ho-Jon pours three water-glasses full of martini and starts                 to distribute them.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Trapper)                          That s the front up the road a few                           miles. We have to get by without                           some of the comforts of home.                                       TRAPPER                          I like an olive.                 He reaches into his parka, comes up with a bottle of olives,                 takes one out and puts it into the martini Ho-Jon serves                 him. Then, as Hawkeye and Duke gape at him, he offers them                 the bottle.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 There are two operations going on, one of them being a simple                 procedure requiring one surgeon and one nurse. The other by                 contrast is a very special event. Trapper is operating,                 assisted by another surgeon, a couple of nurses, a corpsman,                 and the anesthesiologist, UGLY JOHN BLACK. Beside these actual                 participants almost all the nurses and doctors from both                 shifts, including Duke, Hawkeye (with Lieutenant Dish), Frank                 and Henry, are in a circle around the operating table as                 spectators.                 Trapper s job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, or                 some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and                 involving a large chest incision. We see enough of the process                 to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical area,                 but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watching,                 especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an                 operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it.                 The sequence is silent except for incidental operating room                 noises.                 Even Trapper s occasional terse instructions to his assistants                 and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low for                 us to hear.                 There are four stages to the action:                 1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive                 audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by the                 fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never dared                 to attempt.                 2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assurance                 with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working his                 way to his destination.                 3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The                 suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Trapper                 is doing the actual mending job to which all the preliminaries                 have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and                 hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and                 accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive.                 Henry, not certain of his own judgment, looks to Duke for                 confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper                 has the situation under control.                 4. The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his                 satisfaction and begins, along with his assistant surgeon,                 to close up. Henry s smile of relief is unsure and only                 tentative until he catches Hawkeye s signal that the job has                 been done to perfection.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. MASH COMPOUND \\x96 DAY                 Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke emerge from the hospital in                 fatigues. Some enlisted men are tossing a football around.                 One of them makes a wild throw and the ball rolls to a stop                 at Trapper s feet. He stops to look at it and the other two                 halt with him. Then very slowly, Trapper leans over and picks                 up the ball, waving Hawkeye downfield.                 Hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty                 yards away, Trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms.                 Hawkeye just stands where he is, holding the ball, oblivious                 of the enlisted men who want it back, as Trapper and Duke                 continue toward him.                 Revelation jolts him with apocalyptic force.                                       HAWKEYE                          Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around!                           Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat                           Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?                                       DUKE                          Sixteen times.                                       HAWKEYE                          We didn t have a chance, little                           Androscoggin College against the Big                           Green, but there was this blizzard                           and we held then nothing nothing                           till the last twenty seconds. Then                           this great passer of theirs let one                           go, snow and all...                                       TRAPPER                          Lucky you didn t have your mouth                           open or it would have gone down your                           throat.                                       HAWKEYE                          He s Trapper John! Only man in history                           who ever found fulfillment in the                           ladies  can of a Boston and Maine                           Railroad car! When the Conductor                           caught him in there with his Winter                           Carnival date, she screamed:  He                           trapped me!  What have you been doing                           since those days, Trapper?                                       DUKE                          What does he have to do? A score                           like that, a man could just live on                           his reputation.                 The enlisted men, increasingly concerned about their football,                 are muttering mutinously to each other. Hawkeye is too carried                 away about Trapper s identity to notice this till Trapper                 calls it to his attention.                                       TRAPPER                               (to Hawkeye)                          Ball.                 Hawkeye looks at the football and at the enlisted men, and,                 finally getting the point, throws it back to them.                                       TRAPPER                               (relieved to find                                another subject)                          What gives over there?                 They look across the compound to the Shower Tent, behind                 which an Army truck full of GIs has just pulled up. While                 Hawkeye and Duke explain what s going on to Trapper, and the                 three of them move in for a closer look, we see the visiting                 GIs drop one by one from the rear of the truck, pay their                 admission fees and take their places in the line leading up                 to the strategically placed peep hole in the rear corner of                 the tent.

Captain                           Waldowski in the shower?                                       HAWKEYE                          Part of him.

EXT. SHOWER TENT \\x96 DAY                 Corporal Judson from Mississippi takes his turn at the                 peephole.

OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye and Duke are working on a patient about whose chances                 their faces reveal extreme pessimism. The nurse in attendance                 is Leslie.                 Hawkeye takes the patient s blood pressure and frowns at the                 reading.                                       HAWKEYE                          This kid looks like a loser.

Ho-Jon                 sits in his usual place on the floor, following everything                 that s said and refilling martini glasses wherever needed.                                       DAGO RED                          There s sort of a built-in prayer                           for the sick man to get well, but of                           course that s not the basic intention.                                       HAWKEYE                          I don t care about the intention. I                           just know your Cross Action is a                           plus on our side.

TRAPPER                          ...But I turned in my knee pads.                                       HAWKEYE                          Ho-Jon, give the Father some more                           martini.                                       DAGO RED                          Just a taste, Ho-Jon.                               (to the group)                          I d better get to the point... what                           I came here for today.                                       DUKE                          You came because we asked you, for a                           drink.                                       HAWKEYE                          We wanted to tell you how you were                           helping us with your fixes.                                       DAGO RED                          Well, sure, but I m also worried                           about Walt Waldowski \\x96 Painless. His                           poker players got in an argument and                           asked him for a ruling, and he said                           what difference did it make, it was                           just a card game.                 It s obvious from the shocked reactions of the Swampmen that                 the priest couldn t have reported a more ominous symptom.                                       HAWKEYE                          I guess I m getting a toothache I                           better have looked at.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. DENTAL CLINIC \\x96 DAY                 There is no activity around the dental chair, but the nonstop                 poker game is thriving as Hawkeye enters, carrying a bottle                 in a paper bag. The players are evenly divided between                 officers (UGLY JOHN, MURRHARDT and a visiting HELICOPTER                 PILOT) and enlisted men (VOLLMER, RADAR and JUDSON).                                       UGLY JOHN                          Take a seat, Hawk. We can use a fresh                           pigeon.                                       HAWKEYE                          Got to see the man about a tooth.                           Where is he?

VOLLMER                               (indignantly, to Radar)                          How can you call with one lousy pair?

PAINLESS  TENT \\x96 DAY                 Painless is lying on his back on the cot, staring blankly at                 the ceiling. Hawkeye has poured drinks from his bottle and                 is sipping his, but Painless  remains untouched.                                       PAINLESS                          If a man isn t a man anymore, what s                           he got left to live for?                                       HAWKEYE                          Tell me the whole story, Walt.                                       PAINLESS                          There s this native broad works in                           the laundry. I don t know if you ve                           noticed.                                       HAWKEYE                          There s only one worth noticing.                                       PAINLESS                          You noticed. I wasn t going to fool                           around over here. I ve got these                           three girls I m engaged to back                           home...                 He indicates three photographs of young women, displayed                 with equal prominence. Any one of them could make Miss                 America.                                       PAINLESS                          But I had this feeling I ought to                           make the effort. To test myself. And                           I flunked.                                       HAWKEYE                          What did you have to test, for God s                           sake... the dental Don Juan of                           Detroit?                                       PAINLESS                          Don Juanism is just a cover... I ve                           been reading up on it.                               (emotionally overcome,                                turning away)                          I m a fake, I m a fraud, I ve been                           living a lie!                 Moved by the intensity of his self-denunciation, Hawkeye                 bends down close to Painless, puts a comforting hand on his                 shoulder.                                       HAWKEYE                          Painless, you mustn t talk that way.                           It s a lot of crap. Cover for what?                                       PAINLESS                          Homosexuality.                 Hawkeye straightens abruptly, his hand rising from Painless                  shoulder as from a hot stove.                                       PAINLESS                          Now I know that s been my problem                           since I was a kid. But it only caught                           up to me last night.                                       HAWKEYE                          You ve been drawn to other males?                           Since you were a kid?                                       PAINLESS                          No, never in the slightest.

Classic pattern of                           inhibition.                                       HAWKEYE                          That s what you ve been doing all                           these years with every dame you could                           lay your hands on?

Imagine if you found out                           you were one, you wouldn t like                           breaking the news to your wife. Well,                           I got the same problem multiplied.                                       HAWKEYE                          You don t have any problem. You ve                           got thirty good years ahead of you,                           easy.

PAINLESS                          No, one thing I finally know for                           sure, I ll never function with a                           woman again.

HAWKEYE                          There ought to be a law against                           dentists reading. Matter of fact, I                           thought there was.

This leads to another silence, broken by Trapper, who doesn t                 go so far as to stand up but leans way out from his sack to                 grasp the dentist by the hand.

TRAPPER                          We re throwing him a Last Supper. We                           came to invite you.                                       HAWKEYE                          The Painless Pole plans to cross the                           Great Divide tonight and we need                           your help to straighten him out.                                       DAGO RED                          What do you want me to do?                                       HAWKEYE                          Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows                           he s loused himself with the Church,                           but it s part of our plan to make                           him think he has the keys to the                           kingdom. Which he will think if you                           grease the skids for him.                                       DAGO RED                          I don t think I can give absolution                           to a man who s about to commit                           suicide. It s a mortal sin.                                       HAWKEYE                          What is, Red, the intention or the                           act?                                       DAGO RED                               (confused)                          I believe it takes both. I d have to                           look it up.                                       HAWKEYE                          Just use common sense. Your job is                           preventing sin, and the way to do                           that is give him your best Cross                           Action.                                       TRAPPER                          Or you can let him knock himself                           out. You personally d be sending him                           to his grave.                                       HAWKEYE                          An eternal damnation.                                       DAGO RED                               (feeling cornered)                          I don t know. I m not sure what the                           Military Vicar s office would think...                                       TRAPPER                          They sure as hell won t hear about                           it from us.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. DENTAL CLINIC \\x96 NIGHT                 The poker table, and dental chair have been removed to make                 room for two long tables from the Mess Hall. At these a                 sumptuous, candlelit, stag banquet is coming to an end. The                 guests are doctors, administrative officers, chopper pilots                 and enlisted men. Duke is on his feet, raising a glass of                 champagne in a toast. (All our male cast except Henry and                 Frank)                                       DUKE                          Y all come here to say a final goodbye                           to our old friend Walt. But maybe it                           ain t so final. Maybe he s just going                           on ahead into the Unknown to do a                           little recon job for us all.                 During this tribute the guests rise, their eyes on the guest                 of honor, who sits with his food untouched, a vacant                 expression on his face. When Duke has finished and everyone                 has drunk the toast, they applaud and sit down again. Trapper                 raps for attention and indicates Hawkeye, who rises.                                       HAWKEYE                          I just got this one thing to say.                           Nobody ordered Walt to take on this                           mission. He volunteered, for certain                           death. That s what we award our                           highest medal for. That s what being                           a soldier is all about.                 Except for Painless himself, the gathering is deeply moved                 by this thought, some of them to the point of tears. Again                 Trapper restores order.                                       TRAPPER                          Only one man here can add anything                           to that.                 He looks to Dago Red, who stands up, dressed for the first                 time in the priestly vestments he wears for Sunday Mass. He                 walks to where Painless sits and there begins the viaticum                 (holy communion for those in danger of death).                                       DAGO RED                          Receive, my brother, this food for                           your journey...                 A coffin, borne into the room by two enlisted men while Red                 is still speaking, is lined with blankets, equipped with a                 pillow for comfortable reclining prior to the onset of death,                 and furnished with mementos of Painless  earthly career: two                 fresh decks of cards, a box of poker chips, a fifth of scotch,                 some basic dental instruments and the photographs of his                 three fiancees. It is set down on the floor next to Painless,                 who regards it with the first show of interest he has                 manifested during the proceedings.                                       DAGO RED                               (bestowing the sacred                                host)                          ...The body of our Lord Jesus Christ,                           that He may guard you from the wicked                           enemy and lead you into everlasting                           life. Amen.                 Red is making the sign of the Cross when Painless  curiosity                 asserts itself.                                       PAINLESS                          What the hell s that?                                       TRAPPER                          Coffin. Yours.                                       PAINLESS                          I m not even dead yet.                                       HAWKEYE                          You re a pretty heavy guy to lug                           around. Be a hell of a lot more                           convenient for everybody if you got                           into the box as soon as you ve taken                           the capsule.                 He produces and opens a small box, inside which, surrounded                 by pure white cotton, a black capsule is displayed like a                 rare jewel. Dago Red, meanwhile, preferring not to know what                 happens from here on, makes his way out.                                       PAINLESS                               (scrutinizing the                                capsule)                          How do you take it?                                       DUKE                               (appearing at his                                side with tumbler of                                whiskey)                          With whiskey. A good swallow first                           and a big one afterwards. Speeds it                           into the bloodstream.                 Painless takes the tumbler from him with one hand, the capsule                 with the other. He downs a good-sized swig of whiskey, then,                 with the capsule in front of his face, hesitates.                                       PAINLESS                          You guys sure this ll do the job?                                       DUKE                          We wouldn t give you nothing but the                           best.                                       TRAPPER                          We stand behind all our work.                                       HAWKEYE                          You want it straight? Medical history                           records no instance of anyone taking                           this particular prescription and                           surviving.                                       PAINLESS                          Here goes nothing.                 He pops the capsule into his mouth and washes it down with a                 large drink of whiskey. Hawkeye gestures to the waiting                 coffin. Painless gets up and lowers himself into it.                                       PAINLESS                          How much time do I have?

PAINLESS                          I wonder, if Red s fix swings it for                           me, what s heaven really like?                                       TRAPPER                          It s a bedroom where a man is always                           at his peak and doesn t have to take                           any time outs.                                       HAWKEYE                          And all the angels are built like                           Lieutenant Dish.                 The Last Supper guests are filing by the coffin, bending low                 to shake Painless  hand and murmur words of farewell.                                       DUKE                          Drink up, Walt. One for the glory                           road.                 He holds the glass to Painless  lips, helps him down the                 rest of the whiskey.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. POSTOP WARD \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye finishes checking a patient, looks to doorway and                 sees lieutenant Dish standing there. He crosses to join her.                                       HAWKEYE                          Thanks for coming, Maria.

LIEUTENANT DISH                          I couldn t have slept tonight anyhow.                                       HAWKEYE                          You re leaving tomorrow?                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          In less than twelve hours I ll be on                           my way.                                       HAWKEYE                          That s when the real strain starts.                           Three weeks on a troopship.                               (embraces her)                          Poor baby.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                               (kissing him)                          Dear, sweet Hawkeye.                                       HAWKEYE                          Though I guess who it ll really be                           rough on is your husband.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You re on his side all of the sudden?                                       HAWKEYE                          A man would be more considerate. He                           wouldn t come home to his wife a                           nervous wreck.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          How would he avoid it... as if I                           needed to ask?                                       HAWKEYE                          It could be a purely impersonal thing.                           What matters is the therapeutic value                           of relieving your tensions.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You should have been a marriage                           counselor.                               (drawing his head                                closer to hers)                          But I ll show you what s wrong with                           your theory.                 They kiss passionately. Dish is shaken by it and that shows                 in her voice when she continues making her point.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          Do you think anything between us                           could be impersonal? Or pure? You                           better forget logic, because you re                           proving why I shouldn t go to bed                           with you.                                       HAWKEYE                               (after a moment of                                massive internal                                struggle)                          I didn t mean with me.                 It takes a couple of seconds for what he has said to penetrate                 her consciousness. She looks at him incredulously.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You re asking for somebody else?                                       HAWKEYE                          It happens to be a matter of life                           and death.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          A man is going to die if he doesn t                           have my fair young body?                                       HAWKEYE                          Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have                           the same privilege that comes on                           rare occasions to the chief executive                           of some state or nation... the                           privilege of restoring life, by one                           tender act of mercy, to a doomed                           fellow creature.                 While he is speaking, a blue light goes on in a tent in the                 background. As they turn to see what is going on, four men                 carrying a heavy box approach the tent.                 EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT \\x96 NIGHT (OFFICER S CLUB)                 At closer range the box is revealed to be Painless  coffin                 with the departed dentist inside it. The four men who carry                 it into the tent are Radar, Judson, Boone and Seidman. This                 tent doesn t have a wooden door like the Swamp, just a flap.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT \\x96 NIGHT                 The four enlisted men carry the coffin, empty, out of the                 tent. Then Hawkeye and Dish appear, moving slowly toward the                 tent as he continues to break down her resistance.                                       HAWKEYE                          He should come to now for a while,                           but he s got so much dope in him by                           tomorrow he won t know fact from                           fantasy.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          You think he won t.                                       HAWKEYE                          What do you care? You ll be on your                           way to Japan.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          I m fond of Painless, and I d feel                           terrible if anything happened to                           him...                                       HAWKEYE                          It s your decision, Maria. I don t                           want to high-pressure you.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          I d be crazy to think my virtue,                           such as it is, was more important                           than his life...                                       HAWKEYE                          In fact I d rather not try to                           influence you at all.                               (opening tent flap)                          Let s just go in and take a look,                           and then you think it through for                           yourself.                 INT. BLUE-LIT TENT \\x96 NIGHT                 The tent has been fixed up with all the resources at their                 disposal \\x96 cushions, parachute cloth, mirrors and little                 touches of elegance gathered from all over the post \\x96 to                 resemble a luxurious bedroom on the home front. Lying in bed                 (the pool table) between clean, inviting sheets is Painless.                 The boys have undressed him as we can see by his bare                 shoulders. Hawkeye takes Dish by the hand and leads her to                 the side of the bed.                                       HAWKEYE                          One last look at him...                               (raises sheet,                                uncovering Painless                                to the knees)                          ...still alive...                               (slips raised sheet                                into Dish s grasp)                          ...the whole man.                 Dish s eyes pop at what she sees. So astounded is she that                 she doesn t notice Hawkeye has given her the sheet and made                 off.                                       LIEUTENANT DISH                          My God, Hawkeye, I never realized...                           I never even dreamed...                               (becoming aware he s                                no longer at her                                side)                          Hawkeye! Hawk...                 She finds he s disappeared altogether. She can t resist                 turning her gaze back to the uncovered Painless. Then she                 drops the sheet.                 EXT. BLUE-LIT TENT \\x96 NIGHT                 The tent flap drops into place, continuing the movement of                 the sheet. Our attention is drawn up the front of the tent                 to its peak, which points firmly upwards.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. THE SWAMP \\x96 MORNING                 There is the SOUND of a HELICOPTER overhead. Hawkeye emerges                 from the tent to look at it, verifying that it is coming                 from the peaceful south rather than the embattled north.                 Then he sees Lieutenant Dish coming out of her tent, wearing                 her Army uniform and followed by one of the enlisted men                 carrying her bags. Hawkeye waves goodbye but Dish doesn t                 see him. Her face, seen up close, has a serene, faraway look,                 neither happy nor unhappy, but enriched by experience.                 Hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him;                 he understands it s a question of preoccupation and not a                 deliberate snub. He starts across the compound to the Mess                 Hall, noting that the helicopter is descending to land on                 the far side of the hospital.                 EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH \\x96 MORNING                 There is a small welcoming party on hand, headed by Henry                 himself, to greet the passenger arriving in the helicopter.                 When it lands the door is opened and HOT LIPS (as she will                 soon be known) gets out smartly, which is the way she does                 everything. Her official name is Major Margaret Houlihan and                 she is tallish, willowish, blondish, fortyish, prettyish.                 She and Henry exchange salutes and then shake hands. The                 others in the greeting party are out of the habit of saluting,                 and have to be reminded by a stern look from their Commanding                 Officer.                 As Henry and Hot Lips, followed by the others, head for the                 hospital entrance, Lieutenant Dish appears with the enlisted                 man behind her.                 She gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after                 her. A moment later the chopper is airborne again.                 INT. MESS HALL \\x96 DAY                 One of the first people Hawkeye sees in the officer s section                 is Painless, who is eating an enormous breakfast with great                 gusto.                                       HAWKEYE                          Morning Painless. How they goin ?                                       PAINLESS                          Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.                 INT. POSTOP WARD \\x96 DAY                 Frank is listening gravely to a wounded soldier s heartbeat                 through a stethoscope. Standing by awaiting orders is Private                 Boone. Frank has a disturbed reaction to the lack of vital                 signs from the patient.                                       FRANK                               (to Boone)                          Get me one c.c. of adrenaline and a                           cardiac needle.                                       BOONE                          What s a...?                                       FRANK                          Never mind questions. Get them!                 As Boone dashes off with no comprehension of the errand he                 is supposed to perform, Trapper, a couple of beds away, in                 the soiled fatigues he wears on nonoperating room duty, can                 see and hear what is going on. While he watches, Frank checks                 the patient further and establishes that he is dead. With a                 disappointed sigh, he drops the man s lifeless arm and throws                 the bedcovers back over him up to his neck.                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 Henry is showing Hot Lips through the hospital and introducing                 her to personnel. At the moment he is presenting Knocko.                                       HENRY                          Captain Williams, Major.                               (to Knocko)                          Major Houlihan is our new Chief Nurse.                 Knocko holds out her hand in friendly greeting, and is                 startled to find Hot Lips expects a salute instead.                 INT. POSTOP WARD \\x96 DAY                 Trapper, having observed Frank s recognition of the fact his                 patient is dead, is unprepared for what the Major does when                 Boone comes running back with a syringe, a small vial and an                 ordinary hypodermic needle.                                       BOONE                               (anxiously)                          This what you wanted, Major?                                       FRANK                               (looking at vial)                          No, you idiot. I said adrenaline.                           And a cardiac needle.                 He turns back to the patient and goes all over again through                 the same checking process he followed before.                                       BOONE                               (desperately)                          I ll ask a nurse!                                       FRANK                          It s too late. You killed him, Boone.                 A ghastly look appears on Boone s face. He tries to say                 something, can t get it out, and bursts into tears instead.                 Then additionally ashamed of himself for this weakness, he                 runs out. Frank, deciding not to discipline the boy for the                 display of unsoldierly conduct, is proceeding about his                 business when Trapper accosts him.                                       TRAPPER                          You got a moment, Frank?                 He indicates the Utility Room, which leads off the Operating                 Room and the Postop Ward. When Frank assents, Trapper opens                 the door and ushers him in.                 INT. UTILITY ROOM \\x96 DAY                 It s a small room containing, among other items, a table                 with a pot of coffee and cups which are available to medical                 personnel at all hours.                                       TRAPPER                          You all through work for the day?                                       FRANK                          Yes, I am. Why do you want to know?                                       TRAPPER                          Make sure you got time to sleep this                           off.                 He puts his whole hundred and thirty pounds behind a right                 uppercut that lands squarely on Frank s jaw. At the same                 instant the door from the Operating Room opens, and Henry                 gallantly makes way for Hot Lips to precede him.                                       HENRY                          This is the...                 Frank drops to the floor, momentarily knocked out.                                       HENRY                          T-Trapper!... C-C-Captain McIntyre...                           what the hell... ?                                       HOT LIPS                               (staring at Trapper                                incredulously)                          That s a captain?                 Frank is coming to and could probably get back into the fight                 by a count of eight if he had any desire to.                                       HENRY                               (to Trapper)                          What s going on? Who started this?                                       TRAPPER                          You mean who hit who?                                       HENRY                          Yes, that s what I mean.                                       TRAPPER                          I did. First and only blow. So far.                                       FRANK                               (getting up)                          He wouldn t have touched me if I d                           had my guard up. Let us settle this                           between ourselves, Colonel. Alone.                                       HENRY                          What do you think I m running, an                           English boarding school? McIntyre,                           you re under arrest. Confine yourself                           to quarters, pending an investigation.                                       TRAPPER                          If you say so, Henry. But remember                           my claustrophobia.                                       HENRY                               (to Hot Lips)                          I deeply regret this unfortunate                           incident. We try to remember we re a                           military organization.                                       HOT LIPS                          I certainly would have thought so.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. THE SWAMP \\x96 NIGHT                 Henry is standing indignantly over Trapper, who is sipping a                 beer in his sleeping bag. Duke, Hawkeye and Ho-Jon are                 witnesses to the encounter.                                       HENRY                               (yelling)                          What s wrong with you?                                       TRAPPER                          I don t know. I must have lost my                           punch. I didn t think the son-of-a-                          bitch would get up.                                       HAWKEYE                          Stop acting like a colonel, Henry.                           You know Trapper wouldn t sock him                           without a good reason.                                       HENRY                          There s no reason good enough for                           one medical officer to strike another.                                       DUKE                          That there Frank Burns is a menace.                           Whenever a patient croaks on him                           it s either God s will or somebody                           else s fault.                                       HAWKEYE                          This time he did it to a kid who s                           simple enough to believe him. Why                           don t you dump the mother, Henry? He                           creates more work than he gets done.                                       HENRY                          I should fire him because he got in                           the way of Trapper s fist? No. I ve                           put up with a lot from you guys, but                           now I finally have to take                           disciplinary action.                                       HAWKEYE                          Christ. All of a sudden it s West                           Point.                                       DUKE                          What are you going to do with him?                                       HENRY                          Well...                               (to Trapper)                          I was going to name you Chief                           Surgeon...                               (to Hawkeye)                          To consult on both shifts, yours and                           Frank s.

HAWKEYE                          First decent idea you ve had in a                           month.                                       HENRY                          Now I ll have to wait at least a                           week. If I announced it tomorrow,                           after what our new Chief Nurse saw                           this afternoon, they d hear her                           yelling from Seoul to Washington.

MESS HALL \\x96 DAY                 Hot Lip s handsome face is relaxed into her most charming                 smile as she approaches Hawkeye at the table where he sits                 by himself having a late breakfast after a long night s work.                 Hawkeye (like Trapper and Duke) no longer makes any attempt                 at a proper military appearance.                                       HOT LIPS                          Captain Pierce, would I be                           imposing...?                                       HAWKEYE                          Honey, nobody as pretty as you could                           ever impose... please sit down.                           Coffee?                 He offers her some from the pot beside him, and she holds                 out a cup while he pours it.                                       HOT LIPS                          Captain, I ve been observing the                           nurses on your shift. But naturally                           your own opinion is more informed                           than mine.                                       HAWKEYE                          I m glad you feel that way, Major,                           because you see it s a team effort...                           doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and                           I feel responsible for my whole team,                           and I want you to know I m satisfied                           with them.                                       HOT LIPS                          All of them?                                       HAWKEYE                          That s right. We work well together.                                       HOT LIPS                          Major Burns is far from satisfied.                                       HAWKEYE                          That don t surprise me. If you re a                           good observer, you must have observed                           by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.                                       HOT LIPS                          On the contrary, I ve observed he s                           not only a good technical surgeon,                           he s a good military surgeon. And                           that includes how a man dresses and                           how he bears himself and his sense                           of what it means to be an officer in                           the United States Army.                                       HAWKEYE                          And his track record, that don t                           count? Look, honey, when you watch                           the two shifts try to notice which                           one does the most work with the least                           fuss.                                       HOT LIPS                          I ve noticed that both nurses and                           enlisted men address you as  Hawkeye.                                        HAWKEYE                          It s my name. Maybe that sounds silly                           to you but...                                       HOT LIPS                          That kind of familiarity is                           inconsistent with maximum efficiency                           in a military organization.                                       HAWKEYE                          Okay, Major, honey.                               (pushes back his chair)                          I m going to have a couple shots                           scotch and go to bed. I d normally                           ask you to join me but obviously                           you re a female version of the routine                           Regular Army clown. And that turns                           me off, so just leave my outfit alone                           and we ll get along fine.                               (stands up to go)                          See you around the campus.                                       HOT LIPS                               (icily)                          I wonder how a degenerated person                           like you could have reached a position                           of responsibility in the Army Medical                           Corps.

He grabs her and kisses her and from her reaction we get a                 clear picture of the kind of female she is. She responds to                 the kiss fervently, pressing her lips and body against his,                 but the moment she decides to end it she switches right back                 to her businesslike manner.

BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. MASH MAIN BUILDING \\x96 AT MAIL DEPOSIT BOX \\x96 NIGHT                 Frank deposits the letter in the box while Hot Lips stands                 by. Then they proceed on their way to the Mess Hall, unaware                 that they have been observed by Radar on the other side of                 the partition into which the mailbox is set.                 INT. MASH MAIN BUILDING \\x96 NIGHT                 Radar picks up the letter Frank deposited and reads the                 address.                 INT. THE SWAMP \\x96 NIGHT                 There is a party going on.

Radar enters, engages                 Hawkeye s attention and shows him the letter. Hawkeye glances                 through it, looks to Radar for confirmation and, getting it,                 tears up the letter. Meanwhile under Duke s leadership, a                 bedpan is affixed with adhesive tape to Trapper s head.                                       DUKE                          Hail to the chief!

He s crowned                           like a king ought to be, but he can t                           just walk to the Mess Hall by himself.                           He has to be carried by native                           bearers.                                       HAWKEYE                          Good thinking, Duke. How about it,                           Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of                           the boys?

HO-JON                          And if I go to New York, the natives                           there will carry me? I don t think                           so.

MESS HALL \\x96 NIGHT                 Frank and Hot Lips, sitting by themselves in a corner are                 disgusted, and the rest of the people there are mildly amused,                 by the spectacle of Trapper s entrance. The new Chief Surgeon,                 still wearing his bedpan crown, is borne in on his cot by                 Hawkeye, Duke, Painless and Ugly John. They set him down and                 break into song.

Frank follows her.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT.

Instead of lingering on a scene that threatens to become                 pornographic, our attention is drawn down beneath Hot Lips                  cot, where a strange object is being inserted under the canvas                 wall of the tent.

Frank reacts angrily and is about to go                 after Duke when Hot Lips touches his shoulder and speaks in                 a low tone.                                       HOT LIPS                          No, leave all the rowdiness to them.                           Calm down, drink your coffee.                 Hawkeye probably can t make out her exact words, but his                 gaze follows her as she goes out the open door. The he looks                 at Frank, bending low across the table as if he, too, had                 something confidential to say, but actually speaking quite                 distinctly.                                       HAWKEYE                          Tell me, Frank, is that stuff you re                           tapping any good?                 Frank reacts with such rage he can t speak for a moment.                 EXT. MESS HALL \\x96 DAY                 Henry, Leslie and Radar, passing by the Mess Hall entrance,                 encounter Hot Lips on her way out. Her salute catches Henry                 by surprise, but he makes a quick stab at returning it though                 his attention is on what he sees through the Mess Hall                 windows.                                       HENRY                               (to Radar)                          Hawkeye and Frank Burns. That s                           encouraging.                 INT. MESS HALL \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye, who can see Henry outside (which Frank can t),                 affects surprise at receiving no answer to his question.                                       HAWKEYE                          I was just asking...                                       FRANK                          Shut up or I ll tear you apart.                 EXT.

RADAR                          I can try, sir.                 INT.

Do those big boobs                           hold up or are they kind of droopy?                 EXT.

INT.

MESS HALL \\x96 DAY                                       HAWKEYE                          You know, does she go in for sound                           effects...?                 He keeps a wary eye on Frank while talking, and thus is able                 to duck the coffee pot Frank hurls at him. From where Henry                 stands in the doorway, this act of unprovoked aggression is                 astonishing enough, for he can see Hawkeye innocently eating                 his cereal, but the Colonel is even more amazed when Frank                 follows it by springing across the table onto Hawkeye and                 raining blows on him. Hawkeye puts up no resistance but simply                 covers his head and screams.                                       HAWKEYE                          Help! He s gone mad! Help, somebody!                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. MASH COMPOUND \\x96 DAY                 Two MPs are dragging Frank in a straitjacket to an MP Jeep.                 They load him into the back and one of them gets in alongside                 him while the other takes the wheel.                 Watching the MPs drive off with their prisoner are Henry,                 Duke and Trapper.                                       DUKE                          Fair s fair, Henry. If I get into                           Hot Lips and jump Hawkeye Pierce, do                           I get to go home, too?                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY INDUCTION CENTER IN SEOUL \\x96 DAY                 (SNOW IS GONE)                 It is now February. A jeep with Hawkeye at the wheel, Ho-Jon                 beside him, drives up to the entrance. Hawkeye gives Ho-Jon                 a final instruction as the boy gets out of the Jeep and goes                 into the building. Hawkeye finds a place to park in the shade.                 Lieutenant Scorch is with them.                                       LIEUTENANT SCORCH                          It was really nice of you to take me                           along.                                       HAWKEYE                          I didn t have much choice.                                       LIEUTENANT SCORCH                          You really say the cutest things.                                       HAWKEYE                          Yeah!                 INT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER \\x96 DAY                 The locale is established by the presence of military                 personnel in uniform and the fact that a KOREAN ARMY DOCTOR,                 with the aid of one assistant, is examining in quick                 succession a long line of naked young Korean boys. Ho-Jon s                 turn comes up and we see how perfunctory the process is: a                 brief overall scrutiny for visible defects, a blood pressure                 reading, and the application of a stethoscope to a few key                 spots. Ho-Jon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by                 the unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethoscope                 to the boy s heart. He turns to check the blood pressure                 figure which his assistant is about to record on the form he                 has taken from Ho-Jon.                 Apparently the pressure is just as out-of-line as the                 heartbeat, and the doctor feels Ho-Jon is ineligible for                 military service.                                       KOREAN DOCTOR                               (to assistant, in                                Korean)                          We can t take this one. His heartbeat                           is much too fast, and his blood                           pressure is dangerously high.                               (to Ho-Jon)                          Have you ever seen a doctor before?                               (abruptly, to assistant)                          Wait a minute! What does it say there                           about where he s been working?                               (takes Ho-Jon s form                                and reads the                                information for                                himself; then, to                                assistant)                          Get the check on his urine sample                           right away.                               (to Ho-Jon)                          You ll have to wait around for a                           while, young man. I need some more                           information before I talk to you                           again.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. KOREAN ARMY INDUCTION CENTER \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye, with Lieutenant Scorch, waiting in the Jeep, is                 startled at being addressed by a stranger, whom he recognizes                 as the doctor that examined Ho-Jon. Ho-Jon is with him.                                       KOREAN DOCTOR                               (in English)                          You please excuse...                               (as Hawkeye turns and                                sees them)                          I have been making examination of                           this young man to find if he will be                           soldier in our army.                                       HAWKEYE                          Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it                           go?                                       KOREAN DOCTOR                          I don t liking it at all, what I                           hear when I listen to the heart. And                           such a blood pressure for so young a                           boys. Is frightening.                                       HAWKEYE                          I m sorry to hear that. You think                           he s unfit for military service?                                       KOREAN DOCTOR                          At first is no doubt. But then I am                           seeing on his paper he work in                           American hospital. And I think there                           are so many drugs in such a places,                           he could take some by mistake.                                       HAWKEYE                          Why would he do that?                                       KOREAN DOCTOR                          Who is knowing? But the drug I have                           find in his urine is solving all                           mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone                           his fast heart and high blood                           pressure. So I think maybe you will                           like to tell him goodbye. Okay?                 He gives Hawkeye a warm smile and leaves the two of them                 alone. It s clear from Hawkeye s expression that he has no                 choice but to admit defeat.                                       HAWKEYE                          Sorry, Ho-Jon. I didn t think they d                           be that sharp. But I m still going                           to start the ball rolling for you to                           go to college in America when you                           get out. My old school, Androscoggin.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. OFFICERS  LATRINE \\x96 DAY                 It s a warm spring day in a climate much like the northeastern                 part of the United States. At first we see nothing but the                 latrine tent, which is identified by a sign. A couple of                 small missiles propelled with considerable force strike the                 canvas, but it is only when they roll back to the ground                 that we can identify them as golf balls. A closer look at                 the ground area reveals a dozen other balls scattered around,                 and then we see two Korean Houseboys appear from protected                 places on the sides of the tent, looking carefully to make                 sure there are no more balls coming, and proceed to gather                 up those on the ground. During this action there is the SOUND                 of a helicopter landing near the hospital.                 EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS  LATRINE \\x96 DAY                 The disreputability in clothes and grooming that has been                 increasing with each view of the Swampmen has reached an                 extreme stage in the view we now get of Hawkeye and Trapper.                 ALong with their soiled fatigue pants, Hawkeye wears a torn,                 dirty T-shirt of some unlikely color, Trapper a sport shirt                 that looks as if he had picked it up in Hawaii on the way                 over and worn it ever since. Both are unshaven.                 Each has a well-equipped golf bag into which he now replaces                 the iron club he has been using for the medium-range shots                 they have been practicing. Taking out drivers, they set tees                 in the ground and, as the houseboys run up with the balls,                 Trapper indicates they will be shooting down the longest                 dimension of the field. After addressing the balls with a                 few practice swings, they deliver expert drives that are not                 only in the 250-yard range but fairly straight in the intended                 direction.                                       HAWKEYE                               (pleased with himself)                          I came within about ten yards of                           you. You know something, Trapper,                           the way we been going, if we ever                           got to see a real golf course again,                           I bet we could burn it up.                                       TRAPPER                          As far as the greens maybe. I don t                           know if my putting would come back                           or not, without some practice.                 The SOUND of the helicopter taking off again doesn t concern                 them till they realize it is headed directly toward them. It                 comes down so close to them they step back to avoid the wind                 from the propeller blades, which the PILOT keeps going as he                 and Vollmer climb out.                                       VOLLMER                               (to pilot)                          That s him on the right.                                       PILOT                          That s Captain McIntyre?                                       VOLLMER                               (to Trapper)                          The Lieutenant s flown up from Seoul                           just to find you.                                       PILOT                          You re Captain McIntyre?                                       TRAPPER                          That s what the Army calls me. Stick                           out your tongue, take off your shirt                           and tell me where it hurts you.                 His face showing his bewilderment, the Pilot silently hands                 Trapper a long white envelope and a large brown one. Trapper                 tears open the white one, glances at the top copy of the                 order it contains.                                       TRAPPER                           ...Proceed immediately to Kokura,                           Japan...                                (to Pilot)                          Do you know what this is about?                                       PILOT                          There s a GI there whose father s a                           Congressman. A grenade went off in                           training and they think there s a                           piece of it in his heart.                                       TRAPPER                               (opening brown envelope)                          These his X-rays?                                       PILOT                          Yes, sir. Apparently some big chest                           surgeon in Boston told the Congressman                           the only man to take care of his son                           was Captain John McIntyre.                               (his doubt undiminished)                          I suppose there could be more than                           one doctor with that name...                 Trapper meanwhile has held the X-rays up to the sunlight and                 invited Hawkeye to look at them at the same time.                                       TRAPPER                               (looking back at                                orders; to Hawkeye)                          General Hammond says I can take anyone                           along I need to assist me. Want to                           come?                 Hawkeye uses the pretense of scanning the X-rays from another                 angle to draw Trapper aside, so they can speak without the                 Pilot and Vollmer hearing them.                                       HAWKEYE                          I m not so sure the goddam thing s                           in his heart.                                       TRAPPER                           Course it isn t, but how many chances                           do we get to go to Japan? With our                           golf clubs.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. AIRPORT IN KOKURA, JAPAN \\x96 DAY                 It is a bright, sunny afternoon in peaceful Japan. Hawkeye                 and Trapper, in the same outlandish clothes, walk from the                 military transport plane in which they have made the trip                 from Seoul, and approach a car with  25TH STATION HOSPITAL                  emblazoned on its side.                 The driver, SERGEANT GORMAN, is asleep. With their golf clubs                 slung over their shoulders, they get into the back seat.                 Hawkeye pulls the door closed with the loudest possible BANG,                 and succeeds in waking Gorman, who turns on them with outraged                 indignation.                                       GORMAN                          Garrada there!                                       TRAPPER                          What?                                       HAWKEYE                          Let me translate. I ve had some                           exposure to the language. The young                           man is from Brooklyn and he wants us                           to vacate this vehicle.                                       TRAPPER                               (to Gorman)                          But weren t you supposed to meet the                           surgeons who are going to slice up                           the Congressman s son?                                       GORMAN                          You guys are the quacks?                                       HAWKEYE                          You betcher ever-loving A, buddy-                          boy.                                       GORMAN                          Poor kid. Goddam Army.                                       TRAPPER                          But besides the operation, we ve got                           to get in at least eighteen holes of                           golf.                                       HAWKEYE                          So let s haul ass, Sergeant.                                       GORMAN                          Goddam Army.                 But he starts the engine.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. ARMY CAR \\x96 DAY                 There is silence between Sergeant Gorman and his passengers                 as the military hospital comes into view. But something else                 comes into view in the distance at the same time: the                 unmistakable contours of a golf course.                                       TRAPPER                          Look.                                       HAWKEYE                          Beautiful. What do you think? Should                           we stop and play nine holes now and                           operate on the kid later? If he s                           still alive.                                       GORMAN                          Goddam Army.                                       TRAPPER                          I think we ought to operate first,                           no frills, get through it on the                           double. Then we ll be nice and relaxed                           on the course.                                       HAWKEYE                          Good thinking.                                       GORMAN                          Goddam, goddam Army.                 They are coming to a stop in front of the hospital.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 A PRETTY WAC sits behind a reception desk doing a job so                 utterly routine she doesn t even look up from her magazine                 when Hawkeye puts a question to her.                                       HAWKEYE                          Where s the Congressman s son at,                           honey?                                       PRETTY WAC                          Ward Six.                 But then she does glimpse enough of their costumes to take a                 full look, and her reaction indicates clearly that she is                 not prepared for unkempt, unmilitary-looking men carrying                 golf bags.                                       PRETTY WAC                          Hey you can t go in there! Who are                           you?                                       HAWKEYE                          I m the pro from Dover and this is                           my favorite caddie.                                       PRETTY WAC                          Well, you can t go in. No till you                           tell me your business and I check                           with Colonel Merrill s office.                                       HAWKEYE                               (relenting)                          Well, if you must know...                 But Trapper has meanwhile made a feint toward the door, to                 which the Pretty Wac responds by rising and interposing                 herself in his path.                                       TRAPPER                               (to Hawkeye)                          Hold it. If this soldier enforces                           her own orders. I m ready to take                           her on. Anxious. Single combat.                 He moves toward the girl, who holds her ground staunchly                 till they are almost in contact. Then she takes a step back,                 and continues to take one step backwards for each one of his                 in her direction. When they get close to the door, her                 resistance collapses entirely and she scurries back to her                 seat at the desk, where she grabs the phone as Trapper and                 Hawkeye march through the door.                                       PRETTY WAC                               (into phone)                          Colonel Marril s office.                 INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 All personnel, American and Japanese (who, like the Koreans                 at MASH, do the menial work) react in surprise to the sight                 of Trapper and Hawkeye making their way around a few corners                 till they find Ward Six.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. WARD SIX \\x96 DAY                 Two golf bags are propped against the foot of the                 Congressman s son s bed. Trapper listens closely to the boy s                 chest while Hawkeye bends down to his ear to reassure him. A                 WARD NURSE hovers near him, not actually cooperating with                 them but not defying them either.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Congressman s son)                          Don t worry, son. That s Captain                           McIntyre, and he s the best chest                           surgeon in the Far East and maybe in                           the whole U.S. Army. He ll fix you                           up fine. Your daddy saw to that.                                       TRAPPER                          Just like we thought, it s a routine                           problem. Nurse, who s in charge of                           operating room preparations?                 By the time he has begun his question to her, the WARD NURSE                 has spotted someone approaching of whom she is in obvious                 dread. And it is at this figure that she points by way of                 answer: a firece looking NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN.                                       WARD NURSE                          Sh-sh-she is.                 Anticipating that a major confrontation is about to take                 place, Trapper and Hawkeye decide to keep it away from their                 patient s beside. Accordingly they pick up their golf bags                 and go to meet the advancing Captain.                                       NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN                          What are you hoodlums doing in this                           hospital?                                       HAWKEYE                               (politely)                          We re surgeons, ma am, we re here to                           work. All we want is our starting                           time.                                       NURSE CORPS CAPTAIN                          You can t even look at a patient                           here till Colonel Merrill says it s                           okay. And he s still out for lunch.                                       TRAPPER                               (quietly)                          Look, Mother. I want to go to work                           in one hour. We re the pros from                           Dover and we figure to crack that                           kid s chest and get out to the golf                           course before it s dark. So find the                           gas-passer and tell him to premedicate                           the patient. Then bring me the latest                           pictures on him; the ones we saw                           must be forty-eight hours old by                           now. And tell the kitchen to rustle                           up some lunch. Ham and eggs ll do;                           steak would be even better. And give                           me at least one nurse who knows how                           to work in close without getting her                           tits in my way.                               (as she hesitates)                          You re going to have to move quicker                           than that. I said an hour.

At that moment the doors open and in come                 Trapper and Hawkeye, also wearing OR outfits, as are the two                 nurses who stand by waiting for them. Trapper looks                 questioningly at Me Lay, who answers with a nod that all is                 ready.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 The atmosphere in the OR is tense. Hawkeye is maintaining                 proper traction on the clamp that holds the lung in place,                 while Trapper concentrates on removing the fragment.                                       TRAPPER                          Got it.                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          I demand an explanation!                 COLONEL MERRILL, Commanding Officer of the hospital, has                 stormed through the OR swinging doors in full military uniform                 without any antiseptic precautions.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to circulating nurse)                          Get that dirty old man out of the                           operating room!                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          I m Colonel Merrill!                                       HAWKEYE                          Beat it, Pop. If this chest gets                           infected, I ll tell the Congressman                           who did it.                 To everyone s astonishment, including the Colonel s, it works.                 He turns around and walks out without another word. Most                 affected of all by Hawkeye s audacity is Me Lay, who reacts                 with a sharp look in Hawkeye s direction and then by picking                 up his anesthesia chart and writing, in the space labeled                  First Assistant,  the name  Hawkeye Pierce.                                        TRAPPER                          Okay, I m closing up. Everybody relax.                                       ME LAY                               (to Hawkeye)                          May I have the surgeon s name, please?                                       HAWKEYE                          He s the pro from Dover and I m the                           Ghost of Smokey Joe.                                       ME LAY                          Save that crap for the rest of the                           clamdiggers back home.                 Both surgeons stop working in their surprise. Hawkeye looks                 at the anesthesia chart and sees where Me Lay has written                 his name. Then he takes a closer look at Me Lay himself, or                 what shows of him between his cap and his mask.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Trapper)                          Did I ever tell you about Me Lay                           Marston?                                       TRAPPER                          Your high school friend who went                           around saying  Me lay, you lay?  to                           all the young females in the                           community. As I remember, you said                           it was quite a successful approach.                                       HAWKEYE                          Well, he wouldn t score more than                           once in seven or eight tries, but                           the important thing was he didn t                           waste time socializing. Anyway,                           Trapper John, this is Me Lay.                                       ME LAY                          The real Trapper John? The one who                           threw you the famous pass and went                           to greater glory on the Boston and                           Maine Railroad?

TIME LAPSE:                 INT. SURGEONS  DRESSING ROOM, 25TH STATION HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye and Trapper have washed and put their golf practice                 clothes back on. Me Lay is dressed in fresh fatigues with                 Captain s bars.

Sometimes                           I tend bar and act as bouncer.                 A CORPORAL enters with the manner of a messenger from on                 high.                                       CORPORAL                          Captain Pierce? Captain McIntyre?

We might                           as well see him.

CORPORAL                          What?                 Trapper just slings his golf bag over his shoulder with a                 sigh, as does Hawkeye. Me Lay, meanwhile, has written a few                 words on a scrap of paper.                                       TRAPPER                               (to Corporal)                          Never mind.

TRAPPER                          Mine s already been struck, and it                           doesn t have to be very fancy.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Corporal)                          Lead the way.                 The Corporal does so and they follow him out.                 INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye and Trapper come out of the dressing room after the                 Corporal and follow him down a corridor. Then they realize                 to their surprise that there are two other soldiers following                 them who have been stationed outside the dressing door. Their                 invitation from the Colonel is getting to seem less casual                 every moment.                 INT. COLONEL MERRILL S OUTER OFFICE \\x96 DAY                 A SECOND LIEUTENANT and a Sergeant seated on opposite sides                 of a desk look up with interest as Trapper and Hawkeye come                 in with escorts fore and aft.                                       SECOND LIEUTENANT                          These the prisoners?                                       CORPORAL                          Yes, sir.                 Hawkeye and Trapper exchange looks.                                       SECOND LIEUTENANT                          They can wait in the Colonel s office.                           He ll be back in a few minutes.                 The Corporal opens the door to the Colonel s empty and quite                 luxurious office. Trapper and Hawkeye go in with their golf                 bags.                 INT. COLONEL MERRILL S OFFICE \\x96 DAY                 Trapper and Hawkeye enter, the door closing behind them, and                 look around. It is a long time since they have seen                 surroundings like these, with Western upholstered furniture,                 pictures on the walls and high quality wall-to-wall carpeting.                 It is this last feature that attracts Hawkeye s attention.                 He squats down to feel its texture and with a look invites                 Trapper to do the same. Trapper is also impressed with the                 smoothness of the surface, and without having to exchange a                 word about it, they each find a putter and a golf ball and                 start lining up targets for their brief sorely missed putting                 practice.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. COLONEL MERRILL S OFFICE \\x96 DAY                 The Colonel comes in militarily, which is the way he makes                 all his entrances.                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          You men are under arrest!                                       TRAPPER                          Quiet! Can t you see I m putting?                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          I ll have you...!

Your boys blew this                           case, we bailed you out. We figure                           we ought to hang around a day to                           check the Congressman s kid, and we                           also figure to play some golf. So if                           that s okay with you, we got a deal.                                       TRAPPER                          And if it isn t, why don t we call                           Washington on your telephone? You                           tell your story, we ll tell ours.                                       HAWKEYE                               (picking up his clubs)                          When you make up your mind, get in                           touch. The golf club is probably the                           best place to leave a message.                 Trapper has also taken his golf bag, and the two of them                 walk out serenely together. The Colonel supports himself on                 his desk as he makes his way to his chair and sits down to                 absorb the shock to his system.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. JAPANESE GOLF CLUB PRO SHOP \\x96 LATE AFTERNOON                 The shop features an assortment of Western style golfing                 attire, all about two decades behind the times. Trapper is                 holding a pair of  plus fours  in front of him to test the                 size. The GOLF PRO looks on with the studied approval of the                 dedicated salesman everywhere; Hawkeye with amusement.                                       TRAPPER                          These the longest you ve got?                                       GOLF PRO                          Wonderful. They are looking like                           they are made for you.                 Hawkeye has discovered a pair of knee-length argyle socks,                 which he exhibits to Trapper.                                       HAWKEYE                          We got to have these to wear with                           them.                               (glances out window)                          You know, by the time we get all                           this stuff on, it ll be practically                           dark.                 Two GIRL CADDIES enter the shop while he is speaking. They                 are very young, not more than seventeen, dressed in slacks.                 They see Trapper and Hawkeye s golf bags and start to sling                 them over their shoulders.

YAMACHI S N.E.P.H. & W. \\x96 DINING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Trapper and Hawkeye, dressed in kimonos, are sitting Japanese                 style on the floor with Me Lay around a low table. Three                 girls serve them attentively, doing everything for them except                 actually feeding them.                 A girl named MICHIKO takes away a plate that Trapper has                 left virtually untouched and puts a bowl of thick soup in                 front of him.                 The second girl serves soup to Hawkeye and Me Lay, and the                 third brings in a large bowl of rice.                                       TRAPPER                          Soup? Rice? What are we doing,                           beginning all over again?                                       ME LAY                          No, we had a clear soup to start.                           This is a thick one and you ought to                           taste it. There s nothing like it                           back home.                                       TRAPPER                          How can I taste it now? We ve already                           had like twelve courses.                                       MICHIKO                          You are not wishing to eat more? I                           bring you most special plum brandy.                                       TRAPPER                          I don t want it. I don t want to                           eat, I don t want to drink.                               (reaches out and grabs                                Michiko s ankle)                          All I want...                 There is a KNOCK on the door, followed immediately by the                 entrance of a Japanese nurse, who indicates an urgent desire                 to speak to Me Lay. Me Lay gets up and listens to what she                 tells him in an undertone. Trapper meanwhile has succeeded                 in pulling Michiko off her feet, and makes clear the general                 direction of his intentions by sprawling out on the floor                 with her in his embrace.                                       ME LAY                               (to Hawkeye and Trapper)                          Can you guys take one minute to look                           at a kid for me?

HAWKEYE                               (to Me Lay)                          Why can t you look at him?

HAWKEYE                          What s the story?                                       ME LAY                          Well, one of the girls got careless                           and two days ago she gave birth to                           an eight-pound American-Japanese                           male.

ME LAY                          Every time we feed him, it either                           comes right back up or he coughs and                           turns blue and has a hell of a time.                                       TRAPPER                               (releasing Michiko                                and sitting up                                reluctantly)                          We don t have to see him.

A foreign civilian.                                       HAWKEYE                          Don t give them any unnecessary                           details. Just say the pros from Dover                           are on their way with an emergency.                           And you d better get the OR cranked                           up because I got a feeling you re                           going to pass some gas while I help                           Trapper close a little bastard s                           tracheo-esophageal fistula.                 INT. 25TH STATION HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Three OR nurses are at work getting things on order when the                 swinging doors open and Me Lay, carrying the two-day-old                 baby, enters, accompanied by Hawkeye and Trapper. Nothing                 has led the nurses to expect an infant patient, and they are                 distinctly taken aback.                                       FIRST OR NURSE                          Where did that baby come from? Is                           that what you got us up for?                                       HAWKEYE                          Yes, ladies, that s why we got you                           up. Me Lay, put him down there...                               (indicating operating                                table)                          ...and get ready to start giving him                           the anesthetic.                               (to nurses)                          We stumbled on this deal. We didn t                           want it but we don t see how we can                           walk away from it, no matter whose                           rules are broken. This baby has no                           legal right to be taken care of in                           an Army hospital, though his father                           was probably an American soldier.                           But he s going to die if we don t                           fix him now, tonight. So what about                           it?                                       FIRST OR NURSE                          Let s get going.                 Me Lay places the mask attached to his gas container on the                 baby s face ans starts to administer a carefully limited                 quantity.                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          This time I will not be intimidated!                 He has come into the OR while he is talking, and he is so                 menacing that all preparations are halted while he finishes                 his pronouncement.                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          I command that this improper and                           illegal use of Army facilities cease                           immediately. Twice you men have forced                           me into appeasing your aggression by                           threatening me with what you ll say                           to a certain Congressman. Well, I                           don t care what you tell him or anyone                           else! I don t care if it costs me my                           command and my whole career in the                           Army. On this point I stand as a                           matter of principle, as unshakable                           as the Rock of Gibraltar.                                       HAWKEYE                          Me Lay? Trapper?                 Moving in concert, Hawkeye and Trapper grab Colonel Merrill                 and drag him over to Me Lay s end of the operating table. Me                 Lay takes the anesthetic mask from the baby s face and clamps                 it firmly on the Colonel s. The Colonel struggles for a while                 but they manage to hold him and pretty soon he is quiet.                                       HAWKEYE                          Is he out?

The Colonel opens his                 eyes but he is still too drugged to have any idea where he                 is or how he got there.                                       ME LAY                          Okay, Michiko.                 Michiko moves toward the bed, removing the kimono which is                 her only garment. At the same time Hawkeye grabs a camera,                 which is all ready for use with a flashbulb attachment and                 starts to take a series of shots of the Colonel and Michiko,                 both naked in the bed. The Colonel reacts to the intermittent                 bursts of light.                                       COLONEL MERRILL                          What the hell s going on?                                       MICHIKO                          Please, you no worry, sweetheart.

You can                           put your clothes on, Colonel.                 Michiko reaches for her kimono and puts it back on as she                 gets out of bed. The Colonel sits up, still a bit dazed but                 becoming more aware of what s happening all the time.                                       COLONEL MERILL                          I ve been framed!                                       HAWKEYE                          That s what they all say. But I have                           photographic evidence here that you re                           a lecherous old man and a disgrace                           to the uniform. However, I won t                           even develop the film if your people                           watch that baby we operated on like                           he was the Congressman s grandson.

Me Lay open a bedroom door, revealing Trapper fully dressed                 and sound asleep on the bed.                                       ME LAY                          Give him a few hours, Michiko. Right                           now he couldn t get up a flight of                           stairs.                 Michiko s answering smile indicates superior feminine wisdom                 in these matters. She goes into the room, closing the door                 behind her.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT.

He looks at the                 boy s chart and then at the patient himself, finding both of                 them quite satisfactory.                 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM \\x96 DAY                 Trapper, similarly outfitted with individual variations of                 his own, has just examined the baby they operated on. He                 writes out some instructions and gives them to a nurse. Then                 he picks up his golf bag and goes out to a corridor where                 Hawkeye is waiting for him.                 They start to walk toward the hospital entrance, finally                 ready for a few hours of relaxation on the golf course.

HAWKEYE                          It couldn t be good news.                 By joint unspoken agreement, they quicken their pace in the                 same direction.

For the first                 time we see Henry himself in surgeon s working dress, winding                 up an operation. Completing his work, looking tired and                 anxious, he walks through the crowded OR to the Preop Ward,                 which is also jammed up with cases awaiting surgery. Leslie                 comes to meet him.                                       HENRY                          What s the lineup, Major?                                       LESLIE                          Six cases ready for surgery, sir,                           and four more that just need a little                           more blood or a little more time for                           the antibiotics to take hold.

Every time they fly while it s still                           daylight, they ve got wounded that                           can t wait.

Once                 more, as at the beginning, he is standing outside the                 Admitting Ward with Radar, listening for helicopters coming                 from the north. Radar, straining his superhearing to listen,                 reacts unhappily to a sound neither we nor Henry can catch.                                       RADAR                          Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of                           them, I m afraid.

(looking south)                          There.                 Henry looks eagerly to the south as the COMBINED SOUND of                 three helicopters becomes audible and quickly mounts in                 intensity.                 EXT. SKY TO THE SOUTH \\x96 DAY                 A helicopter (the type that came from Seoul to pick up Trapper                 and Hawkeye, rather than the Air Rescue Squadron ones that                 bring the wounded from the front) approaches the landing                 area and starts to make its descent. There is a golf bag                 full of clubs attached to each of its pods.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. ADMITTING WARD \\x96 DAY                 Trapper and Hawkeye, conspicuous because they are still in                 their golf costumes, are among the surgeons checking the                 newly arrived wounded. More cases are still being brought in                 from helicopters and ambulances, mainly on stretchers, a few                 under their own power assisted by a Medical Corpsman or two.                 This is really the most hideous face of war; the mangled                 bodies and limbs and faces, the expressions alive with pain                 and dulled by shock, are more terrible than any number of                 quiescent corpses. Trapper finishes examining a man and speaks                 to Hot Lips.                                       TRAPPER                          This one goes right to the OR.

So never mind                           the side issues.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT.

Lapham                 glances at the patient s face.                                       LAPHAM                          Duke...                 Duke looks, too, and the patient s eyes are enough to tell                 him the job he s doing no longer has any function. After an                 almost superfluous check of the heartbeat, Lapham closes the                 man s eyes.                 INT.

Suddenly all the lights                 in the OR go out. This is not an unprecedented event, and                 one by one three corpsmen appear in different locations around                 the operating table with flashlights whose combined beams                 make it possible for Trapper to carry on.                 INT.

Immediately two other                 corpsmen bring a stretcher to the other side of the table                 and unload a new patient onto it.

Trapper and Duke are examining                 an unconscious Negro private. Trapper looks at him with                 special attention to the eyes. The right pupil is dilated                 and fixed. Duke meanwhile checks his pulse and blood pressure.                                       DUKE                          Pulse, slow, very little pressure.                                       TRAPPER                          Look at that right eye.

You ve been                           that route a little, haven t you?                                       DUKE                          Not enough to be a pro.                 He moves to another case. Duke continues to examine the                 private with particular attention to the right side of the                 head. The more he observes, the more alarmed he becomes.                                       DUKE                               (to corpsman)                          Into the OR! Right now.                 He runs ahead of the stretcher through the Preop Ward. At                 the entrance to the OR he runs into Knocko.                                       DUKE                          Quick, Knocko, get me gloves, knife,                           hammer, chisel, Gelfoam and a drain.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 Knocko finishes saving and cleaning the right temporal area                 of the unconscious private s head, and Duke wastes no time                 making an incision down to the bone.                                       DUKE                          Okay, give me the hammer and chisel.                           There are drills you can make nice,                           neat holes in the skull with, but we                           ain t got none.

He pounds the chisel into the private s skull and keeps at                 it till he cracks his way through. Blood flows out in a                 torrent. Duke pulls his tools away and just watches. Very                 quickly he is rewarded by the sight of a torrent diminishing                 to a dribble.                                       KNOCKO                          What happens now?                                       DUKE                          We sew him up.                 He stuffs Gelfoam down into the bleeding site, puts in a                 rubber drain and starts to sew the skin back together with                 silk sutures.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 The private is moaning and stirring restlessly on the table                 as Duke finishes closing the incision and Knocko takes the                 Patient s pulse.                                       KNOCKO                          Pulse is way back. Nearly sixty.                                       DUKE                          We took the pressure off his brain.                           You know, Knocko, this boy might                           just make it, and if he does you and                           me ought to be ready with a story.                                       KNOCKO                          What do you mean?                                       DUKE                          One thing everybody knows for sure                           that don t know hardly anything else,                           is how delicate any kind of brain                           surgery is. So I certainly wouldn t                           like it if there was somebody going                           around saying all I did was crack                           him on the head with a hammer and                           chisel.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. ADMITTING WARD \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye is examining a young PRIVATE FIRST CLASS who is in                 shock, semiconscious and saturated with mud over his whole                 uniform, hair and skin. There is a muddy, bloody bandage                 around his neck.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to a corpsman)                          Get that bandage off so I can see                           what the hell s underneath.                 He moves on to the next stretcher. The corpsman undoes the                 bandage and pulls it away. The Private First Class turns his                 head to the left, and blood spurts two feet into the air                 from a hole in the right side of his neck.                                       PRIVATE FIRST CLASS                          Mama, Mama! Oh, Mama, I m dying!                 The blood continues to gush as the people in the immediate                 vicinity watch in fascination. As it comes down again if                 falls on the PFC s face and into his mouth. He reacts by                 coughing, spraying his audience with blood. Hawkeye runs                 back and sticks his index finger down the hole, blocking off                 the severed artery and stopping the flow of blood.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to corpsmen)                          Bring him to the OR right on this                           stretcher. I can t take my finger                           out. Somebody find Ugly John and get                           his ass in there.                 They are already in motion toward OR, Hawkeye moving along                 beside the stretcher with his finger in the hole. On the way                 they pass near Leslie.                                       HAWKEYE                          This one is urgent, Les. Start                           somebody cutting off his clothes.                           Tell the lab to come in with a couple                           of pints of low titre O, and type                           and cross-match him for five or six                           more. Get somebody to do two                           countdowns and start the blood. Come                           to think of it, get somebody to start                           rounding up donors, and send some                           cowboys to Seoul for all the goddam                           blood they can get. And get that                           miserable gas-passer in here!                                       UGLY JOHN                               (at OR entrance)                          I m here.                                       HAWKEYE                          Good. Get him asleep and a tube in                           him if you can. His common carotid                           is cut and I can t do anything with                           the son-of-a-bitch jumping all over                           the place.                               (to Leslie)                          Find somebody to help me. I got to                           keep a finger on this or we lose                           him, and I can t get it clamped with                           my left hand.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 The PFC has been transferred to an operating table without                 Hawkeye losing his finger pressure on the artery. The clothes                 have been cut off him, and Ugly John has both blood and                 anesthetic going into him, the latter through an intratracheal                 tube. Hawkeye has a scalpel in his left hand and with it he                 enlarges the wound around his right index finger. Then he                 tries to slide a Kelly clamp down his finger into the wound                 to clamp the artery but he can t manage it lefthanded.                 He looks desperately around the OR only to observe that every                 surgeon and nurse is fully engaged, including Henry and Hot                 Lips. Ugly John is having a hard time fulfilling his dual                 function as it is, and can t possibly take on another. Hawkeye                 tried again with the clamp and fails, and then, to his great                 relief, there appears within in his peripheral vision as he                 concentrates his attention on the PFC s neck, a male figure,                 gowned, capped, masked and gloved. It doesn t matter to                 Hawkeye which of his colleagues it is; he just tells him                 what assistance he needs from him.                                       HAWKEYE                          Grab this Kelly, ride it down my                           fingers and we ll have this mother                           under control.                 The newcomer, though Hawkeye doesn t realize it, is Dago                 Red.                 Following instructions, he takes the clamp and inserts it in                 the wound.                                       DAGO RED                          What do I do with it Hawk? This is a                           little out of my line.                                       HAWKEYE                          Didn t recognize you, Red. When you                           get the clamp all the way down, open                           it as wide as you can and see if you                           can close it on the artery.                 Dagor Red obeys these orders cautiously. When he widens the                 clamp and starts to close it again, he has the satisfying                 sensation of feeling something substantial, and seizes it                 vigorously.                                       DAGO RED                          I got it! I got it!                 But what he has grabbed with the clamp is Hawkeye s finger                 and Hawkeye, by reflex action, pulls it out to where we can                 see it with the clamp grasping it. The blood starts to spurt                 again and Hawkeye goes back into the wound, but this time                 with his left index finger.                                       HAWKEYE                          You got my finger for Christ s sake.                           But maybe I can do better with my                           right hand.                               (inserts a retractor                                into wound, puts the                                working end of it in                                Dago Red s hands,                                taking back the Kelly                                clamp)                          Pull it toward you. More. Good.

That does it for now.                               (to Ugly John)                          We ll keep him right where he is                           till Trapper John can give me a hand                           sewing that artery back together.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH \\x96 LATE AFTERNOON                 Two helicopters descend to the ground, and corpsmen start                 unloading the wounded. Also visible are a couple of ambulances                 that are being unloaded. Henry and the three Swampmen have                 stepped outside the Admitting Ward entrance to watch. They                 are all haggard, unshaven and groggy, but Henry, the oldest,                 is the one who shows the strain the most.

Henry is so fatigued he allows himself to be led away by                 Radar.

Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke are checking                 them to establish priorities. They reach the last cot, on                 which Ho-Jon is lying, attended by a Corpsman we haven t                 seen before.                                       CORPSMAN                          This kid is pretty bad.                 Out of habit Hawkeye looks at the X-ray first.                                       HAWKEYE                          For you, Trapper.

Duke, will you take that belly back                           there? The Australian?                 Duke turns back to undertake his assignment. Trapper and                 Hawkeye continue to study the X-ray.                                       HAWKEYE                          It s in pretty deep.

Hey, Radar!                 Radar, passing through the ward, comes over in response to                 the summons.                                       TRAPPER                               (to Radar)                          Has that A-negative come from Seoul?                           We ll need some in the OR.                                       RADAR                          There isn t any. We keep ordering                           and they don t deliver.                                       HAWKEYE                          We got to have at least one pint.                           It s for Ho-Jon.                 Radar reacts in surprise and looks toward Ho-Jon s cot.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye is assisting Trapper in making the incision in Ho-                Jon s right chest. Ugly John is giving the boy additional                 anesthetic.                                       HAWKEYE                          If we squeeze him through, I m going                           to get him into Androscoggin College.                                       TRAPPER                          How about squeezing him through into                           Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is                           catch lobsters, he can learn that                           here.                                       HAWKEYE                          Dartmouth s too big and too expensive.                           If he s as good as I think he is, he                           can move into the big league later.                           But Androscoggin first.                                       TRAPPER                               (studying the incision)                          We ll need room. The sixth rib goes.                                       HAWKEYE                          Never mind the conversation. Do it,                           Dad.                                       TRAPPER                          You aspirate the blood from the chest                           cavity. Damn, there s more of it                           than I thought.                                       HAWKEYE                               (preparing to use                                suction device)                          If we don t get that pint, he s in                           trouble.                 EXT. AND INT. HENRY S TENT \\x96 NIGHT                 Radar, followed by an associate lab technician, enters Henry s                 tent.                 Henry is snoring away in deep sleep. Gently Radar straightens                 Henry s right arm and deftly injects Novocaine over a vein.                 Henry stirs.                                       HENRY                               (mumbling in sleep)                          Not now, honey. Gobacksleep.                 The lab technician tightens the sleeve of Henry s T-shirt to                 serve as a tourniquet, and Radar expertly inserts a needle                 into the vein and starts extracting blood into a pint                 container.                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye has finished aspirating the blood. Trapper reaches                 down into the wound.                                       TRAPPER                               (triumphantly)                          I got it. Here, feel. In the cava.                 He takes his hand out and lets Hawkeye put his in.                                       HAWKEYE                          I don t feel anything.                                       TRAPPER                          Oh, Jesus.                 He indicates that he wants to feel again. Hawkeye withdraws                 his hand and Trapper puts his back in again.                                       TRAPPER                          I can t feel it now either. The mother                           must have gone in.                                       HAWKEYE                          I don t get it.                                       TRAPPER                          It was in the cava and the hole sealed                           itself off. I must have jiggled it                           just enough to turn it loose. I can t                           feel it in the heart or the right                           pulmonary artery. So it s in the                           left pulmonary artery.                                       HAWKEYE                          What do we do?                                       TRAPPER                          We ll have to close this hole and                           make one on the other side.                                       HAWKEYE                          Be kind of rough on him if there s                           no blood. Why don t we close up and                           sit on him a couple of days?                                       TRAPPER                          Sure, that s the right way... at                           John Hopkins or someplace. But how                           do we know there won t be even more                           of a jam-up a few days from now?                           Maybe we won t be able to get to him                           when we want to. Maybe the goddam                           thing ll erode the artery when                           nobody s looking. Our best shot is                           now.                 Radar comes up to the operating table with a container of                 blood.

Duke and                 Hawkeye are assisting him by applying traction to the tapes                 on either side of where Trapper is now cutting the artery,                 so that there is only a small flow of blood from the incision.                 Trapper brings out his hand and displays the tiny metal                 fragment which is the object of their efforts.

Standing all by itself in an                 empty field is a sign on which some fairly careful carpentry                 and lettering work has been expended.

The heat from which they seek relief is obviosly                 intense, and they are pampering themselves further with tall,                 ice-filled drinks. On the riverbank near them stands one                 empty cup and one half-full bottle of Pimms No. 1 Cup, and                 all three surgeons are more noticeably drunk than we have                 previously seen them.

DUKE                          There s only one way.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. SHOWER TENT \\x96 NIGHT                 Twelve hours later. The shower tent is simply an ordinary                 Army tent enclosing a row of showers supplied by a water                 tank on a high platform in back of the tent. Duke and Hawkeye                 are working under cover of darkness to loosen each of the                 stakes that secures the tent to the ground around it.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. THE SWAMP \\x96 DAY                 The following afternoon. Trapper and Hawkeye sit in chairs                 outside their tent, glasses in hand, still on their tall,                 hot-weather drink kick. Trapper looks at his watch.                                       TRAPPER                          It s five minutes into nurses  shower                           hour. Where are they?                                       HAWKEYE                          They re coming.                 EXT. MASH COMPOUND \\x96 DAY                 The Swamp is at the end of the officers  row nearest the                 nurses  tents, so they have a good view of the women as they                 emerge from their quarters dressed in bathrobes and carrying                 towels, shower caps and bars of soap. The first two to appear                 are Knocko and Lieutenant Scorch. Next, from her own private                 tent, comes Hot Lips.                                       HAWKEYE                          Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures                           you promised to look at of my kids.                           You too, Wilma. It won t take a                           minute.                               (to Hot Lips politely)                          You can see them too, if you want.                                       HOT LIPS                          No, thank you. I m not the slightest                           bit interested.                 She continues on across the compound and enters the shower                 tent.                 Knocko and Lieutenant Scorch come over to the Swamp while                 Hawkeye goes inside to find the pictures. Then two more nurses                 emerge from a tent and head for the showers. Trapper gets up                 and saunters over to intercept them.                 EXT. SHOWER TENT \\x96 DAY                 The door of the tent is closed behind Hot Lips, and after a                 moment there is the sound of water being turned on. Then our                 attention is drawn to the peak of the tent, to which a thin                 scarcely visible strand of wire has been attached. The wire                 is drawn taut and runs across the peak of the barbershop                 tent next door and down the far side of it to where Duke                 sits on the ground operating a sort of windlass upon which                 the wire is wound. He turns the crank with a quick burst of                 energy.                 Back at the shower tent the force of the wire pulls the canvas                 tight, the loosened stakes come out of the ground, and the                 whole tent is whisked right off its center pole, revealing                 Hot Lips nude under the shower.                 EXT. BARBERSHOP TENT \\x96 DAY                 Duke abandons his machine and moves to where he can get the                 crucial view of Hot Lips. The he calls across the compound                 to Hawkeye.                                       DUKE                          Okay, Yankee know-it-all! Pay up!                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. HENRY S TENT \\x96 DAY                 Hot Lips, in her robe, her hair still wet from the shower,                 carrying her towel and shower cap, is expressing her wrath                 forcefully to Henry, ignoring the facts that he is in bed                 and that Leslie is in bed with him, which explains why we                 have never seen anybody make a pass at her.                                       HOT LIPS                          This isn t a hospital, it s an insane                           asylum! And it s your fault because                           you don t do anything to discourage                           them!                                       HENRY                          What do you expect me to do?                                       HOT LIPS                          Put them under arrest! See what a                           courtmartial thinks of their drunken                           hooliganism. It started with their                           calling me Hot Lips and your letting                           them get away with it. You let them                           get away with everything! And if you                           don t turn them over to the MPs now,                           I m going to resign my commission                           and...!                                       HENRY                          Oh, g-g-goddamit, Hot Lips, resign                           your ggodam c-commission!                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. FRONT OF 4077TH MASH \\x96 NIGHT                 Two days later. An Army car bearing the single star of a                 brigadier general drives up to the entrance. The sergeant at                 the wheel jumps out and open the rear door for General Hammond                 and his aide, a captain.

BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. MESS HALL \\x96 NIGHT                 Most of the officers of 4077th Mash are assembled to listen                 to General Hammond. Henry and Hot Lips are both in the front                 row but separated by some distance and not looking at each                 other. All the Swampmen are on hand.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          ...These are very serious accusations,                           and without prejudging the charges                           against him, I am suspending Colonel                           Blake from all his duties during the                           investigation, which I will conduct                           myself. I will also serve as your                           Commanding Officer during that time.                           I shall be calling on a number of                           you for your individual testimony on                           the points at issue.                 Thank you. Carry on.                 INT. DENTAL CLINIC \\x96 NIGHT                 Hawkeye, Duke and Painless are playing poker with a British,                 a Norwegian and an Australian officer. It is close to two                 o clock the same night. General Hammond opens the door and                 looks in, doesn t like what he sees and steps inside. All                 six players are immediately aware of his presence but decide                 to act as if they weren t.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to British Officer,                                who is dealing)                          Gimme three.

GENERAL HAMMOND                          Pierce! That soldier requires                           immediate attention. I m a surgeon                           and I know.                                       HAWKEYE                          You betcher ass, General.

Hawkeye and the Australian throw in their hands.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          Are you going to take care of your                           patient or are you going to play                           poker?                                       BRITISH OFFICER                          King-high flush.                 Painless and the Norwegian throw in their hands, and the                 Englishman pulls in the pot.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to the general)                          I m going to play poker until three                           a.m. or until the patient is ready                           for surgery. However, if you d like                           to operate on him yourself right                           now, be my guest. I get the same                           dough whether I work or not.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          I want to talk to you, Pierce.                                       HAWKEYE                          There s nothing to talk about,                           General. You take the case yourself                           or join me at three o clock. Either                           way you re liable to learn something.                 The General is far from pleased with the disrespect accorded                 him, but as the poker players start a new hand, he decides                 against making an issue on terms selected by Hawkeye. Instead                 he turns around and goes out.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT.

HAWKEYE                          General, at one-thirty when I checked                           him last, this guy had had less than                           a pint of blood, and he d lost two                           or three. His pulse then was 120 and                           his blood pressure was about 90.                           Now, at three o clock, he s had three                           pints of blood. His pulse is 80 and                           his pressure 120. His collapsed lung                           has been expanded and he s had a                           gram of terramycin intravenously. We                           can operate on him safely and we                           should do it quickly, but we don t                           have to do it frantically or                           carelessly.

The incision is still open with sections of bowel on which                 repairs have been done still exposed.

GENERAL HAMMOND                          Obviously you don t think so, and I                           don t know why.                                       HAWKEYE                          Well, Dad, we haven t found any holes                           in the large bowel. They ve all been                           in the small bowel, but the smell is                           different. I caught a whiff of large                           bowel, but it ain t staring us in                           the face, right?                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          Right.                                       HAWKEYE                          So if it ain t staring us in the                           face, it s got to be retroperitoneal.                           And that, along with the look of the                           wounds, makes me figure he s got a                           hole in his sigmoid colon that we                           won t find unless we look for it.                 He has been working all the time he has been talking, and                 now, after a little more manipulation within the incision,                 is able to indicate the perforation he has hypothecated.                                       HAWKEYE                          And there it is.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          I m impressed, Pierce. Naturally,                           the kind of job I have, I don t get                           much chance to keep up with what                           goes on in the OR.                                       HAWKEYE                          Neither does Henry Blake. But I ll                           tell you what makes him the best                           C.O. you ve got in any of your                           hospitals. He leaves all the medical                           decisions to the men who do the day-                          to-day work and understand what                           meatball surgery is.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. THE SWAMP \\x96 DAY                 The following day. General Hammond is having a drink with                 Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke. Ho-Jon keeps the glasses full.                                       TRAPPER                          It certainly isn t Henry s fault Hot                           Lips Houlihan doesn t like her name.                                       DUKE                          Or her figger.                                       HAWKEYE                          She s so square she s even against                           our having a football team.                 This stirs the General s curiosity, but Duke speaks before                 he has a chance to ask his question.                                       DUKE                          You don t think we d be speaking up                           for a goddam Regular Army colonel,                           do you, if it wasn t important?                           Begging your pardon, General. I                           forgot.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                               (to Hawkeye)                          Football?                                       TRAPPER                          Anybody you replaced Henry with                           couldn t last. We guarantee that.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          I didn t know you had a football                           team.                                       HAWKEYE                          Well, it s still pretty much in the                           talk stage.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          We had a team at the 325th Evac last                           fall. I coached the boys myself.                                       HAWKEYE                          I think I heard about that.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          Now we re working out a schedule of                           the outfits we re going to play this                           year. We all chip into a pool and                           make bets.                                       HAWKEYE                          Must be fun. But the point we want                           to make about Henry...                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                               (rising)                          I m sure we could find a date for                           your team. Why don t I take it up                           with Henry?                               (exiting)                          Thanks for the drink, boys.                 After the General has left, the other two Swampmen look at                 Hawkeye uncomprehendingly.                                       DUKE                          Where the hell we going to get us a                           football team?                                       HAWKEYE                          All three of us played for our                           schools. And there are at least four                           other guys...                                       TRAPPER                          But he s got five times the man-power                           to draw on.                                       HAWKEYE                          We can balance that by getting                           ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say                           he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a                           specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon                           Jones.                                       DUKE                          Never heard of him.                                       HAWKEYE                          Sure you have, only as  Spearchucker                            Jones.                                       DUKE                          The nigra boy with the Philadelphia                           Eagles?                                       TRAPPER                          He only lasted one season.                                       HAWKEYE                          On account he got caught in the doctor                           draft. He was a surgical resident                           playing semi-pro ball weekends when                           the Eagles signed him.                                       DUKE                          How come nobody knows about him? And                           you do?                                       HAWKEYE                          I worked with Spearchucker my first                           month over here, at the 72nd Evac in                           Taegu. Most of the colored guys know                           who he is but they re not talking                           because he asked them not to.                                       TRAPPER                          So what makes you think he ll play                           for us?                                       HAWKEYE                          We ll cut him in on the bets we make.                           And still have enough profit to send                           Ho-Jon to college.                                       TRAPPER                          Might make kind of a social issue,                           not having any other Negro officer.                                       HAWKEYE                          He can move in here with us.                                       DUKE                          Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a                           long way, learning to put up with a                           couple of crazy Yankees, but...                                       HAWKEYE                          Don t tell me about your problems,                           boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.                 INT. HENRY S OFFICE \\x96 DAY                 Henry, nervous at what he thinks is going to be his showdown                 with General Hammond, is startled by the General s unexpected                 proposal.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          If we had closer relations, there                           wouldn t be any misunderstandings.                           That s where a football game would                           help. Between your outfit and mine.                                       HENRY                          A football game?                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          Special Services in Tokyo are all                           for it. They say it s one of the                           main gimmicks we have to keep the                           American way of life going here in                           Asia.                                       HENRY                          But what about Major Houlihan?                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.                                       HENRY                          N-n-no thanks, G-General.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH \\x96 DAY                 It is September. A helicopter descends to the ground in the                 familiar location and, as on earlier occasions, Medical                 Corpsmen come from the hospital to aid in unloading it. But                 this time the cargo, instead of wounded men, turns out to be                 boxes which the corpsmen rip open and which contains football                 uniforms: black shoes, cardinal red jerseys, white helmets                 and white pants.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. FIELD BEHIND OFFICERS  LATRINE \\x96 DAY                 A day or two later. Fifteen men are wearing uniforms from                 the chopper load. Practice at this point is confined to                 kicking and passing the three footballs at their disposal,                 and the uniforms still look clean and new. Trapper is a good                 passer, Hawkeye is a better-than-average receiver, and Duke                 punts well, but generally speaking, the balls are dropped                 more often than they are caught, and the overall effect is                 pretty ragged. Among the other players are Vollmer, Ugly                 John, Boone, Painless and Judson. On the sidelines watching                 are Henry, with a whistle tied to a piece of rubber hospital                 tubing around his neck, and, in uniform, SPEARCHUCKER, a                 very big, broad-shouldered black man in his early thirties.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          If I can make a suggestion, Coach.                                       HENRY                          The way I run an organization, any                           man in it has the right to speak his                           mind.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          In that case, here are ten basic                           plays. I think that s about all this                           bunch can handle.                 He hands Henry ten sheets of paper, on each of which a running                 or pass play is diagrammed down to the finest detail.                                       HENRY                          Thank you, Spearchucker. I ll                           certainly take a look at these. Where                           the hell did you ever get that name?                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          I used to throw the javelin.                 Hawkeye catches a pass from Trapper and runs with the ball                 right to where Henry and Spearchucker are standing.                                       HAWKEYE                          Listen, we look pretty lousy out                           there, right?                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          Well, for college players that have                           been out of training seven or eight                           years...                                       HAWKEYE                          I m thinking about how we can make                           more money.                               (to Henry)                          Suppose we bet only part of our dough                           and keep this big animal out of the                           game the whole first half and let                           them roll up some points. Then you                           could bet the rest of our bundle                           between the halves and get the General                           and his friends to give us some real                           odds.                                       HENRY                          It s a nice idea. I mean it has style.                                       HAWKEYE                          It s the only way we can make enough                           to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.                 EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 It is November. The Mash team, in uniform, comes out of the                 quonset hut assigned to it as dressing quarters. Already on                 the bench toward which the players head are a few supporters                 including Dago Red, Knocko and Leslie. Radar is also there                 serving as water boy.                 Spearchucker has a blanket wrapped over his head and held                 together at the chin to eliminate the chance of his being                 recognized as he looks over their opponents, who now file                 out of their quonset hut.                 The first notable thing about them is that they number twenty-                five as opposed to a total of fifteen in uniform for the                 Mash team.                 Second is the even more discouraging fact that two of them,                 one black and one white are enormous, bigger than                 Spearchucker. The uniforms are orange and black.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          Those two big guys were tackles on                           the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead                           played halfback with the Rams.                                       HENRY                          They can t do that to me!                                       HAWKEYE                          The bastards outconned us.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          I think we could still have a chance.                                       HAWKEYE                          If you start the game instead of                           waiting, you mean?                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          No, let s stick to that strategy                           till we see whether you boys can do                           two things. The first is get that                           halfback out of the game. He had one                           year with the Rams before the Army                           got him, but he didn t play too often                           because he s one of those hot dogs.                                       DUKE                          What?                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          When he sees a little running room,                           he likes to make a show... you know,                           stutter steps and cross-overs and                           all that jazz. Also he never learned                           to button up when he gets hit, so if                           you two can get a good shot at him                           once, you can hurt him.                                       HAWKEYE                          But we d have to break his leg or                           something to keep him out of the                           game for good.                                       TRAPPER                          Not necessarily.                                       UGLY JOHN                          As long as there s a pile-up, we can                           do our bit to encourage his permanent                           withdrawal from the contest.                                       TRAPPER                          It s a technique Ugly John and I                           worked out in case something like                           this came up.                                       DUKE                               (gazing across at                                opposition tackles)                          Look at the size of those two beasts.                                       HAWKEYE                          I don t think I could hurt one of                           them with a sledgehammer.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          You can make them run. They ve got                           the occupational disease of oversized                           ex-athletes. They re carrying thirty                           pounds extra apiece. So we run                           everything wide, wide, wide... make                           them move more then they want to on                           every play.                 EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 The Mash team is lined up to kick off, which is Duke s                 function.                 There is only one official, a REFEREE, dressed in conventional                 white.                                       HAWKEYE                          The pro halback is playing safety.                           Kick it to anybody else.                 Duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled                 to his left. But the player who takes it on the thirty-yard                 line simply runs to his left and back a little toward his                 own goal line in order to hand it to the RAM HALFBACK as he                 charges downfield from his safety position. He sidesteps,                 straight-arms or otherwise eludes all eleven of the Mash                 players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown. A few moments                 later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after                 touchdown.                                       HENRY                               (screaming from                                sidelines)                          Stop him! Stop that man!                                       DUKE                               (as they line up to                                receive)                          Sure, you just blindfold him first                           and tie him to a stake.                 Duke is the one to receive the kickoff, which he takes on                 the ten.                 He runs it back about twenty yards, dodging several enemy                 tacklers, then sees the black tackle from Cleveland bearing                 down on him. Duke runs back and forth sideways a few times,                 not gaining any ground but making the other man move.                                       DUKE                          Hawkeye!                 He throws a lateral pass to Hawkeye, toward whom both tackles                 from Cleveland now run. Hawkeye leads them almost from one                 side of the field to the other, then reverses direction,                 keeping them on the move till he sees a chance to throw a                 lateral to Trapper.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                               (from the bench)                          That s the stuff! Run the hams off                           those big hogs!                 Trapper returns the ball to Duke, who manages to make a couple                 of yards forward and a lot more sideways before the Ram                 halfback cuts him down from the rear. The Mash team goes                 into its first huddle.                                       TRAPPER                               (to huddle)                          Okay, don t give them a chance to                           get their breath. Hawkeye wide to                           the right.                 They are near the sideline to their left, playing a winged T                 formation. Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer, the center,                 runs back as if to pass but really gives it to Hawkeye at                 left half as Hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that takes                 him all the way to the right sideline with the two Cleveland                 tackles in pursuit.                 Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but one                 of them brings him down for a gain of no more than two yards.                 On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass, but his                 blockers are of no use against the pro tackles, whom he sees                 descending on him. Trapper starts running straight back for                 a while, then makes a dash to the right followed by a dash                 to the left. He is almost tackled again, and his only route                 of escape is back toward his own goal line.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                               (from the sideline)                          Throw it! Throw it!                 Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spots                 Hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the                 ball to him.                 Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and                 he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play.                 Moving faster than they have to in order not to give the                 opposition any rest, the team huddles.                                       TRAPPER                               (to huddle)                          Wide to the left. Duke, you re the                           pacesetter this time.                 They go into action again. This time Trapper, taking the                 ball from Vollmer, gives it to Duke, who makes a feint at an                 off-tackle play, then turns back and into a wide end run                 instead. Duke is still a good ball carrier by college                 standards and he has little trouble shaking off the amateurs                 who try to tackle him, and is thus able to make it a running                 duel with the professionals. When they finally nab him, he                 is no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage                 line, but the ex-tackles from Cleveland are visibly panting                 and wishing they hadn t allowed all that extra poundage to                 accumulate. On the fourth down, of course, they have to punt.                 Duke goes back to receive the ball from Vollmer at center.                                       HAWKEYE                          Don t try to get it far down. Kick                           it up high so we can get there and                           surround that son-ofa-bitch.                                       DUKE                          Yeah, if I can.                 He does a good job of it. The kick is high enough so there                 are several red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he gets                 under it.                 He raises his right arm for a fair catch. The would-be Mash                 tacklers, including Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated. They                 array themselves defensively while their opponents have a                 huddle and line up to take the offense.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Duke and Trapper)                          Let s get him this time. I don t                           think they ve got anyone else who                           can carry the ball.                 As Hawkeye anticipated, the opposing quarterback slips the                 ball to the Ram halfback, who starts to go wide of the tackle,                 sees Hawkeye, untouched by blockers, closing in from the                 outside, and makes his beautiful cross-over to cut back in.                 At the same time he is hit at the knees by Hawkeye, and high                 by Duke. And there are quite a few other Mash players in the                 immediate vicinity, Trapper and Ugly John in the forefront,                 so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the flashy                 halfback.                 A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching inside                 his jersey and under a shoulder pad, from which he extracts                 a hypodermic needle. With the skill of an expert                 anesthesiologist he pulls up the sleeve of the tackled and                 stunned halfback, and plunges the needle into his arm.                 The Referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the Mash                 players on top of the pile and orally expressing his                 disapproval.                                       REFEREE                          Get off the guy! He s tackled. You                           don t all need to jump on.                 The Mash players quickly remove themselves. Duke and Hawkeye                 are the last to get up. Remaining on the ground is the former                 halfback for the Rams, still firmly clutching the ball but                 looking as if he needed to get a lot of air into his lungs.                 His captain, the white pro tackle, takes one look at him and                 speaks to the Referee.                                       325TH CAPTAIN                          Time! Time!                 The Referee blows his whistle to stop the clock. The captain                 waves for assistance from the sidelines, and the trainer and                 water boy come running in. Radar also appears from the                 opposite sideline with water for his team. Ugly John takes                 advantage of his presence to slip the hypodermic he has been                 concealing in his hand into Radar s pocket.                 Meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the                 Ram halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest                 up. A couple of his teammates assist him to the bench. The                 Mash players observe this.                                       TRAPPER                          Well, he s taken care of. Scratch                           one hot dog.                                       DUKE                          You really think we hurt him that                           bad?                                       TRAPPER                          Hell, no, all you did was knock the                           wind out of him. But he won t be                           playing any more football today.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. 325TH EVAC TEAM S DRESSING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 It is between the halves and the General s players are                 resting, especially the ex-Cleveland tackles, who are                 stretched out prone.                 General Hammond and his TRAINER (a medical Corps Captain)                 are concentrating on the ex-Los Angeles halfback, who sits                 on a table looking groggy. Henry sticks his head in the door.                                       TRAINER                               (to Ram halfback)                          The Trainer has to assist the man,                           and the moment he lets go of him,                           the halfback crumples to the floor.                                       HENRY                               (starting out again)                          Sorry. You obviously won t be wanting                           any more bets.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          The hell we won t! You bastards pulled                           something, I don t know what, but                           we ve been beating you without him.                           Ane we ll go on beating you!                                       HENRY                          You willing to b-back that up with                           odds?                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          Damn right. Three to one, as much as                           you want to put up.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 The two teams have taken the field again. Hawkeye has switched                 to left end, Spearchucker replacing him in the backfield.                 This time General Hammond s men are kicking off to Henry s.                 It s a long kick but it doesn t go toward the center of the                 goal line, where Spearchucker is waiting for it, but to Duke,                 who runs toward Spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral.                 The two pro tackles from the Browns run down the field so as                 to converge on Spearchucker around the Mash twenty-five. But                 the other Mash players divide themselves into equal units of                 five to do nothing but take out the two tackles. The other                 opposing players are no problem for Spearchucker, who runs                 around or right through them, and crosses their goal line                 for a touchdown. The ball is brought out for the extra point                 which Duke scores with a place kick. Before the teams                 reassemble for the next kickoff, the captain of the 325th                 team detours a few yards toward his bench and calls something                 to General Hammond, whose reaction is to stand up and shake                 his fist in Henry s direction. On the Mash bench, Radar leans                 over to Henry.                                       RADAR                          General Hammond, sir, has just been                           informed about the identity of Captain                           Jones. His ringers recognized our                           ringer.                 On the field Duke is preparing to kick off.                                       HAWKEYE                               (to Spearchucker)                          What s the matter?                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          We may be in trouble, I can t catch                           my breath. I ve got the occupational                           disease of oversized ex-athletes.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD, 325TH EVAC HOSPITAL \\x96 DAY                 Spearchucker is trying to block or intercept a forward pass,                 but the two tackles from Cleveland still have enough strength                 left to put him out of action with their combined efforts.                 They block him so forcibly, in fact, that he drops to the                 ground and has some trouble getting up. The pass is completed                 and the receiver tackled on the Mash thirty-five yard line.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          Timeout!

Radar comes out to the Mash huddle with his water-bucket and                 towels.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          We got to stop them right here.                                       DUKE                          And get ourselves another touchdown                           to win.

HAWKEYE                               (getting an idea)                          Radar!                                       RADAR                          All you have to do is ask.                               (concentrates on the                                huddle twelve yards                                away)                          The quarterback is saying they ll                           run the old Statue of Liberty. Their                           left end will come across and take                           the ball out of his hand and try to                           get around our left end.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          What else?                                       RADAR                          Everyone s talking at once, but now                           the captain is telling them to shut                           up. The quarterback says, if the                           Statue of Liberty doesn t work,                           they ll go into the double wing with                           the left halfback taking the handoff                           first and then slipping it to the                           right halfback heading to the left.                 The Referee blows the whistle and the two teams line up to                 resume action. The 325th Evac quarterback drops back as if                 to pass, his left end starts to his right, and the whole                 Mash eleven starts to their left. Only Ugly John finds himself                 temporarily buried under a 265-pound tackle. The other ten                 men in red meet the enemy left end after he takes the ball                 off the quarterback s hand, and they bring him down for a                 loss. The opposing team goes into another huddle but their                 strategy remains as Radar overheard it. When the left halfback                 starts to his right, the Mash players start to their right,                 and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries                 to turn in, he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered.                 Spearchucker hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws                 him back five yards and induces him to fumble the ball. A                 pile of half a dozen MASH players pounces on it, causing                 some damage to each other.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                               (to Referee)                          Time!                 He goes over to the Referee and exchanges a few words with                 him, then walks into his team s huddle.                                       TRAPPER                               (to Spearchucker)                          You got to be the one. We re all                           agreed on that.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          No, it s too far and we re all too                           bushed. I just told the referee we re                           going to try something different. We                           make the center eligible by...                                       VOLLMER                          Me? I can t catch a pass.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          You don t have to. We line up with                           everybody to the right of center                           except Hawkeye, who drops back a                           yard just before the snap. At the                           same time Duke moves to the right                           side of the line.                               (to Vollmer)                          That makes you eligible but all you                           have to do is take the ball right                           back from Trapper between your legs                           and hide it under your belly. Trapper,                           you make like you got the ball, fake                           to me and keep going. One of the big                           guys will hit you, maybe both...                                       TRAPPER                          No! I only got my GI insurance.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                               (to Vollmer)                          As soon as that happens, Sergeant,                           you start walking, not running to                           their goal line. Remember that, don t                           run! Come on, we just got time!                 They break out of the huddle and line up as directed, with                 all the linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmer s right. Their                 opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even more                 confused when, just as Trapper bends down to take the ball                 from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps back into the backfield and Duke                 squeezes into the already crowded right line. Returning the                 ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back, fakes a pitchout to                 Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line, and continues                 backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball and                 were fading for a long pass. So successfully does he create                 this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seeing                 clearly that Spearchucker hasn t received the ball, descend                 on Trapper with their last burst of energy. Two other orange-                and-black linemen also fall on top of him. Meanwhile, Vollmer,                 holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hide                 the ball, and looking as if her were suffering from a painful                 blow beneath the belt, starts walking down the field at an                 angle toward his own sideline, making the opposition think                 he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury.                 Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, looks                 back to where Trapper s tacklers are beginning to remove                 themselves, but also notes out of the corner of his eye that                 only the opposing safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and                 that he isn t paying much attention to him.                 From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the sight                 of his center and Sergeant Major coming off the field.                                       HENRY                          What s going on? What the hell are                           you doing?                 He opens his arms enough for Henry to see the pigskin cradled                 there.                                       HENRY                          Then run for God s sake! Run!                 Vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line, which                 has the unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to                 what is happening.                 He races across the field to cut Vollmer off. Spearchucker                 starts into motion at the same instant and gets down there                 so fast that just as the safety man is tackling Vollmer in a                 way that would throw him out of bounds on the two-yard line,                 Spearchucker hurls himself against the safety man with a                 strong and well-aimed block that sends both men across the                 goal line.                 General Hammond runs onto the field in vehement protest.                                       GENERAL HAMMOND                          Illegal! Illegal!                 The Referee, looking at his watch and raising his Army .45                 to signal the end of the game, goes over to meet the General                 and explain the sad truth to him.                 INT. MASH TEAM S DRESSING ROOM \\x96 DAY                 Some of the players are partly undressed but most of them                 are too exhausted to begin that process. Trapper is stretched                 out on a bench, apparently unconscious. Henry enters                 triumphantly, waving a thick stack of paper money.

SPEARCHUCKER                          What s that, Henry?                                       HENRY                          I out-coached that General Hammond.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 EXT. FRONT OF 4077TH MASH \\x96 EVENING                 A covered Army truck pulls up with the victorious football                 team breaking the normal rule for hospital zones by singing                 a boisterous old drinking song. Several of them have bottles                 in their hands as they descend to the ground. Hawkeye and                 Duke are among the first and the noisiest until they notice                 Lapham (the new surgeon we saw the first time during the                 deluge) standing under the light at the hospital entrance.                 There is something in his expression that makes them break                 off their singing abruptly. Trapper and Spearchucker, jumping                 down after them, react the same way, and their sudden silence                 affects the others so that in a matter of seconds the singing                 has died out entirely. Hawkeye and Duke run toward the                 hospital entrance, Trapper and Spearchucker a little behind                 them.                                                            BRIEF TIME LAPSE:                 INT. AT HO-JON S BEDSIDE \\x96 EVENING                 Ho-Jon is unconscious. Lapham holds an X-ray while Trapper                 scans it.                                       TRAPPER                          It s a massive one.                 The X-ray is passed on to Hawkeye, Duke and Spearchucker in                 turn.                                       SPEARCHUCKER                          Isn t he awful young...?                                       TRAPPER                          That s the artery we sewed up last                           summer. Had to end up smaller, that                           much easier for the thrombosis to                           occur.                 Ho-Jon opens his eyes, slowly reacting to the pressure of                 all the doctors.                                       HAWKEYE                          Pain bad, Ho-Jon?

DUKE                          No, Ho-Jon, we re not going to open                           you up.                 Duke s words are intentionally ambiguous, and when Ho-Jon                 looks from one doctor to another to find the real meaning of                 them, they all try not to reveal it. But he knows.                                                                  TIME LAPSE:                 INT. DENTAL CLINIC \\x96 DAY                 Hawkeye and Trapper are in a stud poker game along with                 Painless, Vollmer, Radar, a helicopter pilot and the Norwegian                 Officer we saw playing before. There is an entrance to the                 hospital visible through a window, and an ambulance is parked                 outside it.                                       VOLLMER                          Pair of sevens ll say a buck.                 The ambulance driver and another soldier come out of the                 hospital bearing a shrouded corpse on a stretcher. Hawkeye,                 choosing not to call the bet, turns over his cards, stands                 up restlessly and sees the body on the stretcher. Trapper,                 who has a view out the window from the seat, also sees it,                 and the effect on him is to take his attention momentarily                 from the game.                                       PAINLESS                          Make it two.                 The helicopter pilot folds his hand, and it s Trapper s turn                 to be next. Radar, who is dealing, waits a moment to see if                 he has to be reminded.                                       RADAR                          Two dollars to you, Trapper.                 Ho-Jon s body is tossed into the back of the ambulance.                 Trapper checks his cards and turns them over.                                       TRAPPER                          Sorry. I m out.

Hawkeye, in a heavy sweater, is running toward the brightly                 lit hospital.                 INT. OPERATING ROOM \\x96 NIGHT                 Spearchucker is doing a brain operation with Duke assisting.                 Hawkeye comes in excitedly but stops within a few feet of                 the operating table because he isn t sterile. He grabs a                 surgical mask and holds it in front of his face as he speaks                 to Duke.                                       HAWKEYE                          Henry s got our orders! We re going                           home!

SPEARCHUCKER                          There might be another tiny piece we                           missed. I want to look around before                           we close up.

He works the retractor he is holding to spread the incision                 while Spearchucker probes it.                                       HAWKEYE                          There s no transportation anyway                           this time of night.

THE SWAMP \\x96 DAY                 The next day, snow still on the ground. Ugly John is at the                 wheel of a Jeep into which Hawkeye and Duke are storing the                 same Valpacs and barracks bags they arrived with more than a                 year before. There is a small group gathered to say goodbye,                 including Dago Red, Lapham and Vollmer, who is Regular Army,                 but none of the others who were part of the outfit when they                 first arrived. When they are all ready to take off, Hawkeye                 and Duke go back inside the Swamp.                 INT. THE SWAMP \\x96 DAY                 Trapper is drunk and gloomy, Spearchucker in fairly good                 spirits.                 Duke pours small drinks into three glasses and adds some to                 the drink Trapper is already holding.

Hawkeye and Duke are inspecting the                 troopship on which they will make the long voyage to Seattle.                 They have undergone a startling transformation: they have                 had shaves and haircuts, and they have abandoned their                 fatigues for clean, new-looking uniforms with Eisenhower                 jackets adorned with their proper insignia, including a                 caduceus of the Medical Corps. There is a lot of activity on                 board the ship and on the dock, where a MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT                 with a notebook accosts them.                                       MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT                          Excuse me, gentlemen, but are you                           sailing on the troopship tomorrow?

By the                 time he comes near where Hawkeye and Duke are standing, the                 Sergeant is beginning to wonder if there is something peculiar                 about the names he is calling. For added protection Hawkeye                 and Duke have replaced their Medical Corps insignia with the                 simple cross of the Chaplain s Corps.

Hawkeye kills it and throws it                 into a trash can.                                       DUKE                          Let s hear from you, you goddam                           Yankee.

MARCIE                       No.                                   JIM KURRING                        You on any medication?

MARCIE                        It s ten o clock in the morning --        There s a small THUMP noise OC. Jim turns his head quick and      looks and Marcie freezes.                                   JIM KURRING                       --- What was that?                                   MARCIE                        I didn t hear anything.       Marcie stands up.                                  JIM KURRING                        No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit                        back down on that couch --                                   MARCIE                        I don t have to do a god damn thing.        Kurring gets his handcuffs out and handcuffs her wrist to the      couch, she goes crazy, screaming and yelling the whole time;                                  MARCIE                        WHAT S THIS? WHAT S THIS? GOD DAMN                        BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON T PUT THOSE --                                   JIM KURRING                        Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN                        and don t do this. I want you to stay --        Continue with that until he s got her cuffed to the couch.       He removes his REVOLVER from his holster and starts to move      slowly down the hall to the back bedroom --                                   MARCIE                        WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT?                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, MOTHERFUCKER?                       MOTHER-GOD-DAMN FUCKER.  WHERE ARE YOU GOIN ?                       DON T GO IN MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.        Kurring keeps moving slowly, gun drawn, CAMERA behind him;                                  JIM KURRING                        This is the LAPD. If anyone is                        back here I want you to come out                       and I want you to show yourself                        to me with your hands in the air --                                   MARCIE                        THERE S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT                       OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.       Kurring moves into the BEDROOM now and sees that the CLOSET is      closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding;                                  JIM KURRING                        This is the LAPD, if anyone is in                       the closet I want you to come out                        and show yourself to me, slowly and                       with your hands up --                                   MARCIE (OC)                        THERE S NO ONE IN THERE!                                  JIM KURRING                        Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone                       is in the closet, come out now --                                   MARCIE (OC)                        THERE S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN                        CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM,                       STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.                                  JIM KURRING                        -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn                       and If I Have To Open That Closet                        you will get shot -- Step Out Now.        Jim inches towards the closet, flips it open real quick and      stands back, ready for something to jump out -- nothing.                                   MARCIE                        I told you there was no one in there!        Jim looks down the hall at Marcie who has physically dragged      the large couch handcuffed behind her;                                   JIM KURRING                        Marcie - Do not drag that couch any further!        JIM S POV, CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CLOSET.       He pushes some sheets aside and burries around to reveal:        A DEAD SKINNY WHITE MAN (50s) curled up in a ball on the       floor of the closet.  He d dead and he s been covered in dirty      laundry.  He has a gag around his mouth.       HOLD on Jim for a moment, he panics a little and swings his REVOLVER      towards Marcie:                                  JIM KURRING                        What the hell is this Marcie?                                   MARCIE                       THAT S NOT MINE.        Jim swings the aim of his gun back at the dead body.                                                                  CUT TO:        INT. EARL S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY       Earl in bed, pretty out of it, but once in a while a couple clear      moments.

Stay with Phil a moment as he turns his head, looking around the      house a moment, looks back to Earl.                                                                   CUT TO:        INT. BURBANK HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - THAT MOMENT       FRANK steps into a CLOSE UP and holding a mic, says:                                  FRANK                       Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.       REVERSE, THAT MOMENT. The crowd of fifty GUYS who are taking the        Seduce and Destroy Seminar  that Frank is teaching today laugh and      play along;        Frank is on a slightly elevated stage.  vBehind him a huge banner for,       Seduce and Destroy,  whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf      with a big buldge in his fur.  It reads:  No Pussy Has Nine Lives .                                   FRANK                        And you did hear me right.  Tame it.                       Take it on, head first -- with your                        skills at work and say,  No.  You will                       not control me.  You will not take my                       soul and you will not win this game.                         cause it is a game, guys, you wanna                        think it s not -- go back to the schoolyard                       and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect                        the cock -- you are embedding this thought:                       I m in charge.  I m the one who says yes,                        no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true.                       Sad But True.  And you wanna know what?                       It must be the way.                        The thing about chicks and the thing                       about this course that we re going                        through today is how universal the whole                        thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here                        and say that it s not -- because the reality?                       If each chick had something new, something                       really new that I d never seen before?                        Fuckin  hell: I d be in the money!  Because                        I d have to create a hundred new cassettes,                       a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars                        and hundred new videos just to deal with each                       and every situation a chick could create -                        but that is just not the case.  They are universal.                       They are sheep. They are to be studied and                        watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped,                       interupted and resisted. I d be makin  a fuckin                        butt load if they were actually as much of                        a challenge as they want you to think they are!                       Reality: They Are All The Same.                        Each and every one of them.  And once you learn                        these methods: You re Set.  You Don t Have To Come Back.                       That s it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why?                       Because all women are the same.  Period.                        End of discussion.  Sorry.  It s true.  Sad But True.                       And anyone who wants to say that these methods                       we work by are  unfair?   Yes, they are.                       Guilty as charged.  And so s the world.                        It s a harsh, hard unfair place, but it s not                        gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie --                        Period.  Sorry.  End of discussion.                                                                  CUT TO:       INT.

FRANK                        I can t believe I m telling you guys this,                        but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS.                       Any girl that calls herself your friend is not                       gonna let you be alone in a situation like that.                       Technique #2: Staging a fight.                        This is not knock down, drag out, crying                       screaming, yelling -- this is a simple,                        direct and subtle way of planting confusion                       into a girl s mind.  Remember we are using                        reinforcement technique  G  with these women.

What could I have done different?                          How should I behave to get this back?                        And if they think that way -- then they                       are asking for you to hurt them and                        That Is What You Must Do.  That is what                       you must do which is punish them many,                       many times over.                                                                  CUT TO:       INT.

LANDON                        If you re happy with Phil taking care                       of him and helping you, that s fine,                        but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --                                   LINDA                        -- you don t understand: it s more pain                        than before and the fucking morphine pills                       aren t working, he s -- past two days it s                        like he can t really swallow them and I don t                        know if they re going down -- I can t see inside                       his mouth anymore -- I m up all night staring                       at him and I don t think the pills are going                       down and he moans and he hurts --                                   DR. LANDON                        We can fix that, because I can give                       you -- are you listening?                                   LINDA                        I m listening.  I m getting better.                                   DR. LANDON                        Do you wanna sit down?                                   LINDA                        I need to sit down.                                  DR. LANDON                        Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it.                       He s dying. He is.  He is dying very,                       very rapidly --        She breaks a bit more.                                  DR. LANDON                        Now the thing here is making that experience                        as painless and easy as possible for him,                        you understand?  Now you need to get in touch                        with Hospice care because they can take care of                       all those practical things that you re asking                        me about -- they are who you call when he dies.        He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;                                  DR. LANDON                        This is the number for Hospice.                       Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go,                       there is something else to consider that                       can take the pain away that he is in,                       there is a very strong and very potent solution                       of liquid morphine....it s a little bottle,                       with an eye dropper and it s easy to get in                       his mouth and drop on his tounge and                        it will certainly diminish the pain that                       he is in but you have to realize that                       once you give it to him; there really                        is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly                       cure his pain, but he will float in and                        out of consciousness, even worse than he                       is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the                        recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --                                   LINDA                        -- how the fuck can I say anything                        to that -- I don t know what to say to that --                                   DR. LANDON                        The job here is to make him as comfortable                        as possible -- right now -- our job is to just                       try and make it as painless as possible.                       Right?  You understand?

RICHARD                       Saucy-saucy.

CYNTHIA                       Just hold it, you ll be fine.        They arrive and enter onto the stage -- CAMERA swings around, branches      away from them and BOOMS UP to reveal the set;        There is a LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE that s being settled into their seats.       It s a three-camera set up with a FLOOR DIRECTOR roaming around,      shouting orders, etc.       There s a spot for the announcer, an old-pro named DICK JENNINGS (60s)      Dick is in the middle of doing bad-comedy warm up for the studio      audience.  He s had a few drinks, etc.        The STAGE itself is a cross between JEAPORDY/NEWLEYWED GAME/PRICE IS      RIGHT.  There s a podium for Jimmy Gator.  One panel holds  The Kids,       and one panel holds,  The Adults.   There are chaser-lights all around      and some of the design feels left over from the early days of the show.       CAMERA hangs out with the KIDS as they are ushered into their panel,      which at this moment faces away from the audience and is behind a      curtain.  Julia turns her head, sees something:                                  JULIA                        Here they come --        The ADULT CHALLENGERS are brought out by an assistant type and loaded      into their panel.  The Adult Challengers are:       Black woman named MIM MacNEAL(40s)       White guy with glasses TODD GERONIMO (20s)      Puerto Rican guy named LUIS GUZMAN (40s)        The Adults give a couple small glares over to the Kids.                                   RICHARD (sotto)                        Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep lookin                        tough-old folks.

Dexadrine s basically                       speed in a pill.  Y know?  But I guess                       a lot of doctors are balancing out                       the prozac with the dexadrine, eh?

The Older Pharamacist DINGS his bell and the Young Pharmacy Kid       gets the bag and starts to ring it up.

PHIL                        There s no number for Frank in any                        of Earl s stuff and he s pretty out                       of it -- I mean, like I said, he s                       dying, y know.

PHIL                        I know this all seems silly.                        I know that maybe I sound ridiculous,                       like maybe this is the scene of the                        movie where the guy is trying to get                       ahold of the long-lost son, but this                        is that scene.  Y know?  I think they                        have those scenes in movies because they re                       true, because they really happen.                        And you gotta believe me: This is really                       happening.

FRANK                        I don t how much I went -- but I was                       enrolled.  I was such a loser back then.                        I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat.                       Not even close to what I am today.                        Not the Frank TJ Mackey you re eager to talk                       to because I was swimming in what was as                       opposed to I wanted.                                   GWEN                        Where does that name come from?                                   FRANK                        What name?  My name?                                   GWEN                        It s not your given name, right?                                   FRANK                        My mother s name, actually.                        Good question.  You ve done you re research.                                   GWEN                       And  Frank?                                   FRANK                         Frank  was my mother s father.                                   GWEN                        Ok.  That s why.  I had trouble locating                       your school records at Berkely and UCLA.                       Your name change -- they had no official                       enrollment --                                   FRANK                        Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn t --                                   GWEN                       They wouldn t?                                  FRANK                        no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn t                       officialy enrolled, that s right.                       Was that unclear?                                   GWEN                       Kind of.                                  FRANK                       I wouldn t want that to be misunderstood:                       My enrollment was totally unoffical because                       I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up                        there.  But there were three wonderful men                       who were kind enough to let me sit in on                       their classes, and they re names are:                        Macready, Horn and Langtree among others.                       I was completely independent financially,                       and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit.                        So what we re looking at here is a true                       rags to riches story and I think that s                        what most people respond to in  Seduce,                        And At The End Of The Day?

So, Claudia, lemme just say,                       so I can get my role of LAPD officer                       out of the way before we enjoy our                        coffee (I never like to talk shop over coffee)                       I m not gonna write you up or anything,                       I m not gonna give you a citation here --                        but the real problem we have is that there                       are people around here, people that                        work from their homes, people tryin  to get                       some work done, and if you re listenin  to                        your music that loud:  They re incovenienced                       by that.  If you had a job you d probably                       understand, but I see you like listenin                         to your music and that s fine, you re just                        gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume,                       maybe memorize what number you see on the                       dial and just always put it to that --                        If it s the middle of the day -- that s                        what I do -- just put it on two and a half                        and that s a good listening level, alright?                        I see you like listenin  to your music loud,                       but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you                       end up damaging your own ears ok?                                   CLAUDIA                       Yeah.                                   JIM KURRING                        Arlight, then.  Cheers.        They clink coffee cups.

Brad smiles with his braces, Donnie looks      away quick --                                  THURSTON                        It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who                        also spoke of a fella  Who was not only                        dull but a cause of dullness in others.

DONNIE                        -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson                       never had his life shit on and taken from                       him and his money stolen -- who took his                       life and his money?

THURSTON                        This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.                                   DONNIE                        I used to be smart but now I m just stupid.                                   THURSTON                        Shall we drink to that?       Donnie looks to the television for a moment, starts to tear up,       CAMERA pushes in slow to an EXTREME CLOSE UP.  He repeats line s from      his days on  What Do Kids Know?  and does his best Jimmy immitation;                                   DONNIE                         If a brick weighs one pound plus one                        half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?                         Well if subtracting the half of brick from                       the whole brick you got one half of brick,                       equals one pound so therefore the brick                        equals two pounds --   A little more than                        kin and less than kind,  is Hamlet to Claudius.

Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done.                       Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is?                       How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and                       ahead of it s time this concept is?  I m                        talking about eliminating insight and understanding                       as human values.  GOD DAMN I M GOOD.  There is                       no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for                       UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take                        any subjective human experience -- in other                       words -- all the terrible shit or all the                        great shit that you ve had happen to you in                        your life -- and quickly and easily transform                       it in the unconscious mind through the subtle                        and cunning use of language.

A state that is brand new.  The System s state.                       What did I do?

KLIGMAN                        Adultery isn t illegal -- it s not something                       that can be used in a court to discredit                       the will or -- Linda. Linda.

KLIGMAN                        You don t have to change the will,                        if what you want to do is get nothing                       you can renounce the will when it s time.

Considering that there s no one                        else mentioned in the will...we d                       have to go to the laws of intestacy,                        which is -- as if someone died without a will --                                   LINDA                       What does that mean?                                   KLIGMAN                        The money would go to Frank.  The court                        would put the money in the hands of a relative --                                   LINDA                        -- that can t happen.

KLIGMAN                        -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted                        as a beneficiary that s what will happen.                                   LINDA                        This is so over-the-top and fucked-up                       I can hardly stand it.                                  KLIGMAN                       Linda, you just have to take a moment                       and breath and one thing at a time --                                   LINDA                        Shut the fuck up.

KLIGMAN                        You need to sober up.                                   LINDA                        Now you must really shut the fuck up, please.

GAME SHOW STAGE - THAT MOMENT       Three MEN in TUXEDOS and HARMONICAS have taken a place near      the band.  Jimmy, reading from his cards, introduces them and      asks the following question:        (Note: Jimmy s speech is starting to slur a bit more at this       point.  His motor skills seem to be fading quickly.)                                  JIMMY                        Imagine you are attending a jam session                       of classical composers and they have                        each done an arrangment of the classic                        favorite,  Whispering.   Here are three                        variations on the theme, as three classic                        composer s might have written it -- you are                       to name the composer.  The First:        The Harmonica Fella s play an arrangment....CAMERA pushes in close      on STANLEY and TITLS DOWN CLOSE TO HIS PANTS....       Stanley begins to piss his pants.  He trembles and shakes and       holds back tears as the wet stain gets bigger.       OC through this we hear the Adults answer the question:                                  TODD (OC)                       Well, Jimmy that sounded to me                       like Brahms, a bit like his Hungarian                       Dance Number Six, I believe.                                   JIMMY (OC)                        Excellent. Next number:       The Harmonica Fella s play another arrangment of  Whispering       that sounds like Ravel s  Bolero.        Stanley moves his arms down to his sides to cover his crotch       and pull at his pants -- and his BUZZER goes off with a brush      of the side of his arm --                                   JIMMY                        Stanley the Man -- answer:       Stanley.  HOLD.  He starts to cry. Julia and Richard look over      at him and see his pants and they start to laugh a bit.                                  STANLEY                       ...I don t know the answer...        Jimmy starts to STUDDER and SHAKE a bit....holds a tight grip on      the podium;                                   JIMMY GATOR                        That is not right!  That s not right,                        Stanley, the answer is...Ravel....Ravel....                       ....xhjksndlsmnop.....       CAMERA WHIPS and pushes over to the FLOOR DIRECTOR.                                   FLOOR DIRECTOR                        What the fuck is wrong with him?

INSIDE THE COBRA           A GUNNER sprays fire down at unseen anti-aircraft. All           that can be see on the ground are whizzing TRACERS flying           up at the chopper.                                                            Tropic Thunder 4.

EXT.,, HOT LZ -- DAY            As the Cobra comes in hard, about TWENTY INFANTRYMEN are           emerging from the tree-line, in a chaotic fire fight with           twice as many VC SOLDIERS.           As the. chopper tries to land, the gunner tosses a couple           of grenades behind the Americans, sending about ten VC           flying. But the bulk of the platoon is getting GUNNED           DOWN by the enemy.           A. heavy set grunt, FATS, looking like he is in great           pain, is running full speed for the chopper, taking fire           from all over.           Fats looks a  lot like JEFF PORTNOY, star of . Doody For           Dinner .           BROOKLYN, an.18 year-old cherry from Brooklyn, is also on           the move, towards the.chopper...Clutching his thick black           glasses, and a. map, and triangulating coordinates, he  is           frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio           backpack. A GRENADE EXPLODES ten feet away knocking him           on his ass.           He gets up, shaken, just in time to be BAYONETED. through           the stomach by a VC SOLDIER...           The VC soldier turns around just in time to be machine-           gunned down-5y MOTOWN who has all sorts of stomizd           shit  on his fatigues, an ace of spades in his helmet,           along with some graffiti scrawl that reads  and God           spoke  including cut-off sleeves that reveal his           impressive pipes. He, is a  bad muthaf.ucka.            MOTOWN           That s for Brooklyn, Muthafucka!           Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed           out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16           with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower.           It does.           Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him           over his shoulder, Brooklyn s shirt is blown open           revealing his entrails...in shock, he clutches his liver           in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back           in his body...                                                           Tropic Thunder 5.           FATS heaves Brooklyn onto the floor of the still-airborne           chopper just as it gets low enough, and returns to           firing. He unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the           approaching VC...            OSIRIS            FATS! GET YOUR ASS ON THIS CHOPPER NOW!

OSIRIS            FOUR LEAF IS DEAD MEAT, SOLDIER! AND YOU            GOT ZERO 0  HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS            ON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM!

Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked           finger...            BROOKLYN           It s him. It s Four Leaf...           Everyone turns to-see...           FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN           from the  Scorcher  trailer, . burst through the treeline,           half limping, half crawling heroically through the           massive firefight in SLOW MOTION.           He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS...           Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and           can t believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the           pilot. I            OSIRIS            GO! GO!           Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs           the chopper s runner, and in a superhuman show of           strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might,           preventing it from flying away.           The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues           his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm,           providing weak cover for Four Leaf.           The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about           ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle           with the helicopter.           Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is           fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn t           even have a gun...                                                           Tropic Thunder 7.           Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at           Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his           face.. .           FOUR LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his           knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of           lead...            OSIRIS            I HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE            THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I M GONNA BE            BRINGING BACK TO THIS BIRD.. .COVER ME!           Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do           just that... unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps           out of the chopper like an Apache warrior.           Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his           machine gun in cool SLO MO.           Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four           Leaf. Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer           fire ...           Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf,           cradling his head. Four Leaf s eyes are glassy, and his           body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.            FOUR LEAF           Get outta here. I m worm food, man, you           dig?

Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman,           is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and.           more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry.           The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting           uncomfortable holding Speedman s not-crying head.                                                           ,, Tropic Thunder 9.

To be working with all these           great actors, and you.            DAMIEN           You re the only one who auditioned.           You re the only one who did the two week           boot camp, Sandusky.            SANDUSKY           Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird.           Wasn t the point that we were all           supposed to bond?            DAMIEN            (BITTERLY)           Yes, that was the point.           Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it.           We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of           food.           Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a           spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS           who is deeply uninterested.                                                             I             I           r Tropic Thunder 30.            SPEEDMAN           I guess I just watched some retarded           people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time.           with them... watching them.. Watching all           the retarded stuff they did.            LAZARUS           Huh, I always found mere observation a           little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to           mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram           the source of the pain. Then live it.            SPEEDMAN           (trying. to keep up)           Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the           first time in-my life..           (searches for the word)           Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer,           retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth           retarded. In a `weird way I had to           unlearn what it was to be... .NOT           retarded.            LAZARUS           Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was           smart. Or, rather, didn t think he was           retarded. So you can afford to play           retarded , being a smart actor. Tricky           tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there.           Especially.knowing how the Academy is           about that shit.           Speedman is lost:            SPEEDMAN           About what?            LAZARUS           (with  a chuckle)           Are you serious? Everyone knows you           don t ever go fully retarded!            SPEEDMAN           How do you mean?           Lazarus sets his. drink down. School s in session.            LAZARUS           Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man.           Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT           retarded. He could count toothpicks,           cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT           retarded. HANKS . Forest Gump. Slow? Yes.            (MORE)                                                           Tropic Thunder 31.           LAZARUS (cont d)           Retarded? Maybe. Had braces on his legs,           he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a           ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers,            Being There , infantile? Yes.           Retarded? No.           He claps a hand on Speedman s shoulder.            LAZARUS           You went full retard, man. You never go 14           full retard. Don t believe me? Ask Sean           Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard.           Went home empty handed.           Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be           so stupid?            LAZARUS           (cruelly, driving it home)           But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could           be your ticket to Oscar gold. I d lose           the hook hands though... cripples don t           give the Academy wood either.            SPEEDMAN            (DAZED)           Oh.           Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass           and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately           holding the spring,roll in his hook.            ON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM           Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high           strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by           his posse and a CAMERA CREW.            DAMIEN           Redykulous... I need to talk to you.            REDYKULOUS           What up, money.            DAMIEN           (in a hushed tone, aware of           the cameras)           We re having a cast meeting, right now           We need to come together as a unit --           The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien           uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout           the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.                                                           Tropic Thunder 32.            REDYKULOUS           Uh-huh...           Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i           started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch           style camera move...           DAMIEN i           Do you mind if we step away for a moment?            REDYKULOUS           From what?           Damien tries to indicate the crew.            DAMIEN           (whispering even lower now)           From the...uh...you know... .this area..            REDYKUL:OUS           Oh, I see...sure           They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire           camera crew follows.            DAMIEN           Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the           cameras.            you understand?. Away from           (indicating the crew)           them...            REDYKULOUS           No.            DAMIEN           What?            REDYKULOUS           No. I can t do that. If Redykulous           steps away from the cameras then my           .people don t get to see the real           Redykulous. The show is called  Utterly           Redykulous .            DAMIEN           Well this is about work ...my show so to.           .speak. Do you understand?            REDYKULOUS           I guess. But not really. Your show and           my show are the same thing. This is gonna           help your show, trust me.

REDYKULOUS (cont d)           My show AND the soundtrack drops the same           time  Tropic Thunder opens. So you get           that crossover audience everybody wants           on your opening weekend, which will           dictate your revenue streams all the way           through DVD release, pay per view,           etcetera.           Damien thinks this over for a second. It does sort of            make sense. He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1  144%           for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from           them...            DAMIEN           Excuse me, everyone! If I could have           your attention!           Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a           couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.            DAMIEN           Sorry to break up the party, but I just           wanted to call your attention to a cast           meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of           the film depends on it!            (UNRAVELING)           Not to mention my entire bloody life!           Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on           the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand.            DAMIEN            GODFUCKITI SHIT!           Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien s           shoulder. He steps to the fore.            SPEEDMAN           (slowly, deliberately)            When... we. .. put... aside... our...           differences... we see we re kind of the           same.            Within moments, the place settles completely.            SPEEDMAN           (Long beat...-then almost           quietly.)            When we put aside our differences, we           see we re kind of the same. Let s be           friends, I know we will do great things           together.

I know a lot of the           reason things are maybe messed up is ME.           The guys look at each other -- maybe he s not so bad.            SPEEDMAN           I was looking-at it all backwards.

You couldn t find a dixie           coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your           prick. and showin  you the way...           Damien doesn t know what the fuck that meant.           Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes.           Damien s eyes widen in fear.                                                            ,I            I           â\\x80\\x9eTropic Thunder 35.

Deep in the           jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties.           Nothing but triple canopy jungle and           cockroaches the size of melons.           Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his           weirdness.                                                            1           Tropic Thunder 36.

FOUR LEAF           Rig up your documentary cameras in that           jungle, give me and Cody a few of those           smoke bombs and some charges and we could           light up the jungle so those lily-dick           actors would think they were in the           middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them           thinking they re getting shot at, and           you ll have your movie.           Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as           though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished           mosquito  between the claws of his prosthesis.

We move across the faces of the actors, all in           brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except           for Sandusky who seems excited.           Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent           Rick Peck.            PORTNOY            (FINALLY)           So, uh, any idea how long we ll be gone?

They all shrink back. Four Leaf s fierce posture is           undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien           sprawling onto hire.            DAMIEN           That sâ\\x80¢right.

The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the           doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters than a           crack platoon.

FOUR LEAF           See you in hell!           As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts.           trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.  The           Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving.           All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that           has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of           an old rusted outâ\\x80¢ downed chopper.           All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who           seems very upset.

DAMIEN           Congratulations. You ve just landed in            the shit . Your objective is to head           north and liberate the village at D ang           Kwook Hill, at which point  Four Leaf            gets himself captured, at which point you           rescue him, at which point we will           chopper you home. We will also be           rigging this entire valley of death with           hidden cameras so that every glorious           moment gets on film. And believe me it           WILL be glorious. If it looks real,           chances are good it probably is. You           wanted to be actors? You wanted to           occupy the skin of another human being?           Get ready to occupy the skin of a           terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded           by death, crawling up Satan s arsehole.           There s going to be enemy fire. Booby           traps. Your own personal little slice of           the  Nam.           The group shares a look --  What s going on?            He pulls out a laminated packet.            DAMIEN           (to Spe?dman)            Four Leaf , since you re the Captain           here, here s the scene list and the map.           (he throws them at him)           Think you can handle it? From now on,           Whatever we get on film is our movie,           period.           Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie.                                                           .Tropic Thunder 40.            DAMIEN           THIS is your only link to, the real world.           It will be used only in an emergency or           to replenish our supplies if absolutely           necessary. This is NOT a cell phone.           This radio goes to the chopper, and the           chopper ONLY. The chopper is GOD, and I           am Jesus Christ his SONI!! You will            depend on and pray  to US!! And nobody ï¿½iï¿½ï¿½ i n I  ï¿½IMdï¿½4           gets home until we get the shots!           (loud and confident)           Now... let s put the greatest war movie           ever in the can!           With that, Damien marches toward the treeline and steps           on a dormant LAND MINE left sleeping for decades., BLOWING             HIM TO BITS.           The group stands absolutely stock still for several long           beats until...            SPEEDMAN           Whoa.            EXT. JUNGLE. -- A HALF MILE AWAY            A group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed           and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion.           They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language.           One of them grabs a radio:            GUERILLAS            (SUBTITLES)           < We have heard an explosion, in the           northern sector.>            A UNKNOWN VOICE           (crackling over walkie           talkie),           .           They lock and load, heading towards the actors...            EXT. JUNGLE -- A.HILLTOP CLEARING            Four Leaf scans the horizon while. Cody sets up high-tech           equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation           devices.                                                            I           Tropic Thunder 41.            CODY           So, I m thinkin  as soon as Damien gives           us the go ahead, we ï¿½ust their cherry           with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha           till they come running right at, us, then           a good of fashioned firefight,           maintaining our distance.           Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle,           looking almost lost.            CODY           I been meaning to tell ya the whole           shoot. I m probably one-a your biggest           fans. Your book was kinda my  Catcher in           the Rye . It inspired me to become a gyro           man.           Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic           stare.            CODY           I m actually sort of a war nut. I mean I           never was in the service, but for me           blowing shit up in a war films is sort of           my way of paying tribute to the real           deal. And you sir, are the real deal.           Nothing.            CODY           Hey, I was wonderin  what kind of sidearm           you carry? Looks to me like a--            FOUR LEAF           (very scary)           I don t know what it s called. I just           know the sound it makes when it takes a           man s life.           Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.            CODY           Ok, we re ready to rock and roll.           (to walkie-talkie)           Damien, come in. Cameras are up,           ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires           and light the fires on your say so.                                                            11           Tropic Thunder 42.            EXT. JUNGLE - THE ACTORS            WE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which           has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys,           staring at Damien s corpse in total shock. All except           Speedman, who looks on with a smirk.            PORTNOY           I think he s like... dead.            SPEEDMAN:           (with a chuckle)           Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice,           wherever you re hiding!            REDYKULOUS           I don t think he s hiding.. I think he           just died!           Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse.           pulls a wrist into frame.            SANDUSKY           He doesn t. have a pulse ...or a head.           He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.            SANDUSKY           Must ve been one of those Claymore mines.           This old Jungle must.be full of them.,            REDYKUZOUS           You bet your ass it is. That s why a           percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are           helpin  solve the problem!           Damien s corpse emits a disturbing death rattle.           Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the           hell?           Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent           older brother.            SPEEDMAN           C mon! Don t you get it? This is what           .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of           the Nam! He s trying to get in our           heads!                                                           Tropic Thunder 43.            GUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE           They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys           from about thirty feet.            SPEEDMAN           That whole  life and death  speech in the           chopper? He s meshing  with us! What do           you think all that  playing God  was           about?           The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief --           except Lazarus.            LAZARUS           Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is           dead!!           Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn t want to take sides.            SPEEDMAN           Kirk. I know you re the big fancy actor           here, but, no offense, I ve done a lot           mote effects driven event films, and I           think I can spot a prop body.

DAMIE--           The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up,           showing it to the guys. See?            SPEEDMAN            (SMIRKING)           Alright, can we start the scene now? Or           do you need a formal invitation?!           (checking the list)           Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day.

He opens them, and grabs. his gun and creeps           towards the bushes, stealthily..            SPEEDMAN           (as Four Leaf)           I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats.           The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM            c mon!  type look. Portnoy doesn t know what he means...            SPEEDMAN           I said, I got a baaad feeling on this           one, Brooklyn...           Oh! He s acting!           Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking.           stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie.           Swinging his gun unpredictably.            ON THE GUERILLAS           They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the           other side of the. trees... they back off as. he waves his           gun...

PORTNOY           The last  mugambo  you ever tasted was in           your momma s soup bowl. I wouldn t mind           slurpin  on a little of that --            SPEEDMAN           That s enough outta you Fats. Don t you           worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a           fucking ahead of you and I for one ain t           gonna let Charlie...           Lazarus can t handle it anymore.            LAZARUS           What the FUCK is wrong with you people?!           Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back.           He addresses the treeline.            SPEEDMAN           Sorry Damien! Back to one... action!

Speedman sighs, annoyed.            SPEEDMAN           How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some           of us are taking this seriously.           Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he           becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive           transformation -- Everything except for his skin color           returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.            LAZARUS           (Heavy Irish)           Jaysus! There isn t going to be any           movie, ya gobshite!

THE GUERILLAS           Are watching this, poised to attack.            BACK ON THE ACTORS           Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now.            SPEEDMAN           Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped           something.           He mimes picking something , off, the ground.            SPEEDMAN           It s called your character. Don t worry,           I won t tell the Academy!           Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have           seized the moment.           The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for           Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and           debris kicks up all around him.            SPEEDMAN           You happy now? We re out of position for           the effect! Am I the only one who read           .the script?! This is the ambush!           A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks           of wood and shrapnel everywhere.            SANDUSKY           I think they re really shooting at us!            SPEEDMAN           What are you guys worried about? These           guys are pros. The unions would tear           them a new ass-if any of us got hurt.

No one follows Speedman s lead., Fine, he ll go it alone.           Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and           doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment           of absurd action style maneuvers throughout.           Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and           join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what           the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen           enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES.            ON THE GUERRILLAS           Not knowing it s only blanks, and awed by the power of           the actors  automatic weapons, and the intensity of their           screams, they drop back...            GUERILLA LEADER                      The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up           RPGs...            EXT.

Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.            CODY           What? I still can t get Damien on the           radio. I bet he forgot how to use the           Walkie again. What do you say we get a           little... pro-active?           Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.            BACK ON THE ACTORS           Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to           blow them to kingdom come with RPGs.           But before the guerillas have a chance--                                                            I           t  Tropic Thunder 48.

Dirt flies, the guerillas don t know what the hell is           going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the           shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat.            EXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING            Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody s handiwork with           binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle.            CODY           Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!.           Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring           straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine           guns pointed straight at them.            CODY           Oh shit.            FOUR LEAF           Oh yeah.           And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of           consciousness...            EXT.

The guys  adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all           around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the           jungle, sensing that someone was out there.                                                           Tropic Thunder 49.            SANDUSKY            So what do we do now?           Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.            SPEEDMAN           Damien said to head north. I m guessing           they ve got more of these  battles  and           Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way.           (into it)           Alright, let s hump-our shit to D ang           Kwook! Let s didi double time! We got a           lot of clicks to cover!           Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of           jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little           lost.            SANDUSKY           Uh...Sir, isn t it that way?           Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances           down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up           now.            SPEEDMAN           Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...

Lazarus, very reluctantly,           brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A            EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING            It is a large, secret heroin processing facility,           surrounded by barbed wire fencing. It is in a clearing           in the jungle, by a small river.           There s a GUARD TOWER overlooking a main gate, which           leads into a big open courtyard area. The main structure           is a low, concrete military-looking building.           It s all populated with tough-looking, well-armed           badasses.                                                           Tropic Thunder 50.           CODY AND FOUR LEAF, both hog-tied and unconscious, are           marched through the courtyard, and into a building.            INT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND - COMMAND CENTER            We are behind the back of the person who is in charge. In           front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar           heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere.           A cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired.           The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is BYONG. He s           badly shaken.            BYONG                      The Unseen Leader shakes. his head.            UNSEEN LEADER           .            BYONG                       UNSEEN LEADER.           .            EXT. BAMBOO FOREST -- DAY            The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of           bamboo. They look exhausted -- except for Speedman, who           always manages to look like.a.movie star.            PORTNOY           So... we re just supposed to keep           walking?            SPEEDMAN           We ll see some action soon enough. And           try to stay in character. We re on           camera..            PORTNOY           What do you mean  soon ?                                                            ,I           Tropic Thunder 51.            SPEEDMAN           Whenever Damien decides it s time, I           guess.            PORTNOY           When s that?            SPEEDMAN           I don t know. That s the whole point.           Damien wants us tired and confused.            REDYKULOUS           Yeah, well I m definitely qualifying for           those objectives.           Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus           notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.            SPEEDMAN           Fine, fine. Okay, let s take a break,           but be on the lookout for anything.           Charlie doesn t care if you re on a break           or not.           Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled.           Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take           a leak. Lazarus then watches him go.           Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears           something rustle next to him.            LAZARUS (O.S.)           Psst. Hey.           Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close           to him.            LAZARUS           Speedman is watching. I don t have much           time. I don t really need to piss. I           need to talk to you. You went to the           boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read           that map?            SANDUSKY           Yeah...            LAZARUS           Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That           hoor s melt really thinks this is a           movie. And he s got the lot of ya           convinced.                                                           Tropic Thunder 52.            SANDUSKY           You saying you don tithink they re           filming us?            I            LAZARUS           Of course not! It s only a matter of           time before he walks us into more mines           or more of whoever the hell was shootin ,           at us. That muppet s going to get us all           killed. I need to convince everyone.to           turn around, but I .can t do it without           the map. You re the only one who can           read it. Can I count on you?            SANDUSKY           Well, yeah, I.guess. But            LAZARUS           Good man, Good man.           Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he s done peeing,           shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group.           Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to?           Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee           again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see           Speedman, right next to him.            SPEEDMAN           I m gonna level with you, bro. I don t           need to pee. I need to talk to you.           Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat           and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create           a red pee.stream.            SPEEDMAN           Lazarus is insane. He s freaking out, and.           he s gonna.ruin the whole movie for all           of us. The men respect you, because you           went to boot camp and rehearsal.           (patting his shoulder)           And you re pretty handy with that map. I           need you on my side, Kyle.            SANDUSKY           Kevin.                                                           Tropic Thunder 53.            SPEEDMAN-           If you stick with the program, I m gonna           talk to some of the Dreamworks           brass... there ll probably be a Teen           Choice award in it for you. You have           that potential.            SANDUSKY           Well, I --            SPEEDMAN           Good man. Good man.           Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.            EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER            The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown           path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth.            SPEEDMAN           If we stay on this trajectory we should           be reaching the village any minute now.           At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating           from Portnoy.            SPEEDMAN           Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead           of us...            PORTNOY            (SICK)           No... its just that I don t feel so hot...           I left my medication at the hotel.            REDYKULOUS           (to himself, snickering)           Yeah, I d like to check out some of those            meds  for my own self.           Lazarus moves up to Speedman.            LAZARUS           Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a           village don t you think we would have hit           it by now?            SPEEDMAN           Quit your carping, we re right where           we re supposed to be!                                                           Tropic Thunder 54.           WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of           frame...           We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW            MOVING RIVER.            LAZARUS           .(laughing)           Hey, Is there a feckin  river on that           map?           S.pee`dman refers to the now sopping wet map.            SPEEDMAN           Yes! There is! Its just a little more            down to the... lefty-down part from the:           village.           (checking the scene list)           Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat           Raid at the end of the second act.            LAZARUS           I don t see a  Sampan  boat!            SPEEDMAN           Any second now one should come by.           Alright men, into the water!           Everyone except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water.           They all hold their rifles above their heads.            LAZARUS I           - L-et- -s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We           need to quit faffin  about and turn.           around NOW! And...           Lazarus grabs Sandusky.            LAZARUS           Sandusky agrees. with me. Don t you,           Sandusky?           Kevin is caught, not sure what to d            SPEEDMAN           Wait! First of all...           Now Speedman grabs him.            SPEEDMAN           Kelvin believes in this movie. And,           second, need I remind you,. I am your           superior officer.                                                           ,. Tropic Thunder 55.            PÂ\\x96º            LAZARUS           No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves,           a pretty shite one.           The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels            himself.            SPEEDMAN           THAT S THE WAY OUT! That s our only           chance!            PORTNOY           Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until           they send help! Or maybe try to get back           to the hotel.            SPEEDMAN           Help from where! Need I remind you that           Damien s orders were to --           (right at Lazarus)           --stay in character.           (to the guys)           Now, I already have an international box           office presence, but for some of you, I m           guessing you might not want to screw this           movie up!           This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can t           believe it.            SPEEDMAN           .okay...C mon, boys! This way. Let s go           get those Viet Congs!           Lazarus throws down his gun. He s had it.            LAZARUS           Jay-sus Fuck! It s Viet Cona! Not Viet           Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey,           if you re so sure of yourself, why don t           you let Kelvin have a look at the map?!           Kevin doesn t know what to do -- he doesn t want to get           in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough           guy.            SPEEDMAN           Be my guest.           Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a           long beat...                                                           Tropic Thunder 56.            SANDUSKY           We ve been going the wrong way.  We were           supposed to be doing this:           Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route -- a           clearly marked, northward arrow.            SANDUSKY           instead, we did this. i I ï¿½1d Iv I. 11M%           Sandusky draws a line due East --..into a. section of the.           map clearly marked with scary skull and cross-bone type 14 %           warnings.            PORTNOY           (holding his stomach)           Oh, man, this is not  cool, this is not           cool at all.           Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.            SPEEDMAN           I can t believe you people!. You re           pussing out on me? We are supposed to be           a unit!            LAZARUS           No one is  pussing out.  They just           prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can           you get us back to the landing zone           without the map?            SANDUSKY           It might be tricky, but maybe.            LAZARUS           Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin  war           with Mister Box Office? Or staying           alive?             SPEEDMAN           Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna           abandon this movie?           A long tense. beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards           Lazarus. Everyone follows him.           Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his           head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle           with both hands over his head.                                                           ,. Tropic Thunder 57.            SPEEDMAN           So that s the way it,,is, huh? Fine! I ll           finish the movie alone!           (turns to Lazarus, under his            BREATH)           And when I give my acceptance speech,           I ll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for           staying out of that scene. And come Oscar           night, we ll see who feels a little  full           retard !           He reaches the other side of the river.            SANDUSKY           Chris, You have no idea where you re           going!            SPEEDMAN           Yeah, I do!           (consulting the scene list)           I m going to  EX S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR           LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE . And, I can           shoot it alone.           They watch him trudge into the foliage.           U2 S  BULLET THE BLUE SKY  comes up as the men watch           Speedman disappear...            EXT. MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE -- SUPER WIDE -- DUSK            We slowly push in on a lone figure silhouetted against           the purple sky, trudging along the top of a trail to           nowhere.            CLOSER           Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is           tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all sorts           of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the           treeline.            SPEEDMAN           DORF!...CODY?!...What s the deal with a           meal break? Are they gonna chopper stuff           in later on? I don t wanna be a prima           donna or anything, but, we gotta eat,           right?            (PAUSE)           Damien?                                                           P-  Tropic Thunder 58.           Clearly no answer.           He trudges a bit further finally  plunking down.by the           trunk of a huge tree. ,           He empties his pack, within which is the gift bag.from           his.agent. He  surveys his wares: An i-pod. Nano, an In           Style magazine, a neck pillow, Cherry Chapstick, a,           tonight--show baseball hat, some packets of equal, and an           unopened  MRS.

Portnoy is beginning to make all           sorts of pained and horrible noises.            PORTNOY           Uhhh... .UHHHHHHHH.            (PAUSE)           Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn...I m cold.

It s like           a sweat lodge out here!            LAZARUS           Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly,           Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud           ranks of those of us who have suffered           for art.           (to Portnoy)           A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When           this is all over, you might have more           than flatulence to offer an audience.           Portnoy looks a little hurt.            REDYKULOUS           You know what? I think I actually liked           you better when you were a nigga.            LAZARUS           You know, Redykulous , I respect what it           is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking           -- invented by the Irish I might add.

Why do you think that-is?            REDYKULOUS            Why ?! I dunno...maybe because they had           one good part for a black man in this           movie and they gave it to a white guy.            LAZARUS           Oh...I see...Put another way -- you re           mad because I can act  black  better than           you can.            SANDUSKY           Take it easy guys...            REDYKULOUS           (to Sandusky)           You better rein in  black like me  over           here, before I put a foot in his white           ass...            LAZARUS           Niggaz always got to be niggaz.           This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at           Lazarus. They fight.           Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly           avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw.           Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.            SANDUSKY           Okay! That s enough! Jesus Christ! It s           not enough we have people shooting at us!           Now we have to kill each other?! Let s           pull it together! This place is full of           land mines! Or doesn t anyone s sense           memory recall our director being blown           up by onel?           That shut them up.            LAZARUS           Sandusky is right... we could all learn a           little from his common sense approach.           From now on we walk Indian style,           footstep upon footstep.

He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick.           Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a           tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He           then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents           into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule.           He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A           rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and           begins to stalk his prey.           Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of.           fur...           Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness,           and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is           heard...

He spots a box with the           words  For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting .           His mouth LITERALLY waters, and a drop. of .spittle oozes           from his bottom lip. He doesn t know what to do. He           gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box.           marked  pure . It s like holding two grenades...

CUT TO:            EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- DAY            Peck is tied up, in ragged, prisoner clothes, hanging in           the cage. He has been there a while.            PECK           Ok, look, you wanna go through this           again, let s do it. I see more for you           than this. This whole  big fish in the           little scary jungle pond  thing. I see           you as a front man, as a leader, not just           of this little rebel guerilla warrior           group. I see it big picture. Is it music,           is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I           don t know. But I do know it is not           happening with you staring at me doing my            I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings  routine           for you and the peanut gallery for           another six months. It s old school           already.           TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of           the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into           the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a           soaking Peck.            PECK           (not missing a beat)           And it makes me sad to see you chomping           on the stogie and you re not even           fourteen or whatever. I m thinking  what           hole does that need to fill, that you           have to keep dipping me into the water to           somehow feel better about yourself?  I           can be a partner to you, not just a           captive.            (MORE)                                                           Tropic Thunder             106.           PECK (cont d)           But you have to allow me into your inner           workings, into your headspace to           facilitate that. And to do that you gotta           let me outta the cage, both figuratively           and literally. Until you can let me go, I           you.can t let you go. Do you get that?           He gets dunked in the water again.            PECK           Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore           subject. Can we do a little business on           the blackberry privileges? Cause you re           killing me here.            BLACK                                 THE END     ',\n",

Casey moves away from the stove and takes a seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass door.                  CASEY         I don t know.

CASEY         That s not what you said.                  MAN         What do you think I said?  Casey CLICKS on the outside light.  A flood light illuminates the backyard.  Her eyes survey the grounds.  But it s empty.  No one s there.  She turns the light out.  On the stove, the popcorn POPS.                  CASEY         I have to go now.

He has gotten her full attention.                  CASEY         Is this some kind of a joke?                  MAN         More of a game, really.  Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front doors...moving to it.  It s unlocked.  She bolts it.                  CASEY         I m two seconds from calling the police.                  MAN         They d never make it in time.  Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking through the peephole.  ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE.  A distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a bit, relieved.                  CASEY         What do you want?                  MAN             (pure evil)         TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.  Casey s jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the phone, throwing it down on a side table when...  THE DOORBELL CHIMES.  Casey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes again.                  CASEY             (calling out)         Who s there?  Another CHIME.  She moves to it.                  CASEY             (louder)         Who s there?  No answer.  Fuck this.  It s time for the police.  She goes for the portable phone. Just as she picks it up...  IT RINGS.  Casey almost drops it, losing her breath...  She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying nothing...listening, waiting...  A long silence.  And then.                  MAN         You should never say  Who s there? .         Don t you watch scary movies? It s a         death wish.  Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her damndest to hang tough.                  CASEY         Look, enough is enough. You had your fun         now you better leave me alone or else.                  MAN         Or else what?  CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating...

CASEY         So you better leave.                  MAN         His name wouldn t be Steve, would it?  Silence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it.                  CASEY         How do you know his name?                  MAN         Go to the back door and turn on the porch         light--again.  Casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the kitchen...to the glass doors.  Her shaky hand finds the light switch...she hits it.  The back yard is lit.  Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big, line backer of a guy, her boyfriend...  STEVE  tied and gagged.  He s been roughed up, but he s alive. CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend, pleading with her.                  CASEY         Oh Goddddd...  Casey SCREAMS.  Her hand moves to the lock on the door.                  MAN         I wouldn t do that if I were you.  Terror rides Casey s face.  She s petrified.                  CASEY         Where are you?                  MAN         Guess.  Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees.  He could be anywhere-anywhere.                  CASEY             (begging)         Please don t hurt him.                  MAN         That all depends on you.                  CASEY         Why are you doing this?  Tears find their way, streaming down Casey s face.                  MAN         I wanna play a game.                  CASEY         No...                  MAN         Then he dies. Right now.                  CASEY         NOOO!                  MAN         Which is it?  A long silence.  Casey touches the glass...staring at STEVE...this big jock of a guy is crying too.                  CASEY         What kind of game?                  MAN         Turn off the light.  Her hand goes to the switch...Steve tugs and pulls at his straps...as if begging her...his face sweat and tears...  CLICK  He disappears in the darkness.  Casey moves away from the glass, back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified.                  MAN         Here s how we play. I ask a question. If         you get it right-Steve lives.  Three curtainless windows line one wall.  Casey crouches down behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it s socket, darkening the room.  Her body quivers.                  CASEY         Please don t do this...                  MAN         Come on. It ll be fun.                  CASEY         No...please.                  MAN         It s an easy category.

MAN         Come on, yes you do.                  CASEY         Please..stop...  Casey is SOBBING.                  MAN         What s his name?                  CASEY         I can t think.  Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all reality.                  MAN         Steve s counting on you.  Suddenly...through tears...Godsent...                  CASEY             (a whisper)         Michael...Michael Myers.                  MAN         YES!  Casey SIGHS...relieved.                  MAN         Now for the real question.                  CASEY         NOOOO....                  MAN         But you re doing so well.                  CASEY         Please go away! Leave us alone!                  MAN         Then answer the question. Same category.  Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor.                  CASEY         ..please..no...                  MAN         Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.  A mad smile purses Casey s lips.  She knows this.  She leaps up, through tears, screaming...                  CASEY         Jason! Jason!...JASON!  A slight PAUSE.                  MAN         I m sorry. That s the wrong answer.                  CASEY         No it s not. It was Jason.                  MAN         Afraid not.                  CASEY         It was Jason.

Jason         didn t show up until the sequel.  Casey is stupefied.                  CASEY         You tricked me...                  MAN         Lucky, for you there s a bonus round.         But poor Steve...I m afraid...he s out.  This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass doors.  She flips on the porch lights to see...  STEVE  eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground between his feet...steam rising.  A SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on the floor...nearly passing out.  CLOSE ON her face...pale and ghostly white.  She SOBS.                  MAN         Final question. Are you ready?  She doesn t answer.  A long, maddening silence.  Casey reaches up and CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing, hoping...                  CASEY         ..leave me alone..please...                  MAN         Answer the question and I will.  Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly back and forth.                  MAN         What door am I at?                  CASEY         What?                  MAN         There are two doors to your house. A         front door and a back one. If you answer         correctly-you live.  From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.  She deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize.  Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to decide between the two.                  CASEY         Don t make me...I can t...I won t.                  MAN         Your call.  In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up and grabs a long, sharp knife.  Casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...  SHATTERS TO BITS...  as a lawn chair come flying through it.  Exploding glass sprays everywhere.  This incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting out of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered doorframe.  ANGLE ON CASEY  Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to FEET ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly sliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the front door.  Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other.  Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off...  EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE  Casey it at the back corner of the house.                  MAN         I can hear you. I know you re here.  Casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side of the house...going for the front yard.  She must pass the three curtainless windows.  She gets to the first one and peeks in...  The FIGURE has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her.  Casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the FIGURE is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall that leads to other parts of the house.  She moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the third window...she peeks in to the FIGURE...  STARING BACK AT HER...  His face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his eyes piercing through...soulless...Casey SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as a hand...  CRASHES through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she beats at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his arm...she wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as the hands disappear inside the house...  EXT.  CORNER OF HOUSE  Casey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door. It remains closed.  Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when suddenly....  HEADLIGHTS APPEAR  in the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she recognizes them instantly.  Mom...Dad...she tears off across the yard toward them...moving like lightning...  The car turns into the driveway...Casey SCREAMS, waving madly, rushing by a tree as...  THE GHOST MASKED FIGURE APPEARS  Casey stumbles back, catching her balance...the FIGURE moves on her, arm poised high...a flash of silver...and Casey is struck, across the chest.  She looks down to see her shirt blossoming red...a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee.  The knife rises again...Casey throws her hand forward...the blade comes down...but it s blocked by the portable phone still in her hand.  She turns staggering to...  EXT.  DRIVEWAY  A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE emerge from the parked car.  They move to the front door completely unaware of what s happening to their daughter, only feet from them.  EXT.  FRONT YARD  Casey stumbles forward...her parents ten feet away...she opens her mouth to scream but no sound resonates...she is beyond words...staggering, swaying...the FIGURE moving behind her.  EXT.  FRONT DOOR  Her parents approach the door                  FATHER         That fish smelled strong.                  MOTHER         I told you to send it back.  The father discovers the front door ajar.  A puzzled look.  Casey is right behind them with one arm outstretched.  If they d only turn around...  They enter the house and close the door as....  Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest...the FIGURE upon her.  INT.  FOYER  The father sees straight back into the kitchen...the shattered patio door.                  FATHER         Jesus...                  MOTHER         What is it? Where s Casey?                  FATHER             (calling out)         Casey? Casey?  In a split second they re both panic stricken.  The father begins searching the house frantically.  The mother is hysterical.  EXT.  FRONT YARD  CLOSE ON Casey...she s dragged by her feet through damp soil...the life going fast from her body...her hand still clutching the phone.  INT.  FOYER  Back in the house.                  MOTHER         Where is she?                  FATHER         Call the police.  The mother moves  to the phone in the foyer, picks it up...There is no dial tone.  She jiggles the base.                  FATHER             (searching)         Casey? Where are you honey? Call the         police, goddammit.                  MOTHER         The phone s dead.  The...the softest...faintest voice is heard...                  CASEY             (from phone)         ..help me...                  MOTHER         She s here, God, I can hear her.         Where s my baby?  The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the phone.                  FATHER         Where is she?                  MOTHER         I can hear her. Oh Mother of God,         I can hear her.  The father upturns the living room.                  FATHER         Casey! Casey!                  MOTHER         Not my daughter...not my...  The husband grabs hold of his wife.                  FATHER         Get in the car and drive down to         the Mackenzie s.  The other throws the front door open and rushes out...the father moves through the house when a SCREAM echoes out.  That of his wife.  He tears off for the front door.  EXT.  FRONT DOOR  The father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees, bent over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front yard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares witness to the single, most horrifying sight he ll ever see.  That of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak tree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open.  BLACKOUT!  BEGIN MAIN TITLES  FADE IN:  INT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT  A teenage girl s room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age- old stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a desk against the wall where...  SIDNEY PRESCOTT  a young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor in front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep, lonely eyes.  She s comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown.  Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...  CRASH-BOOM  A noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window across the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward it.  EXT.  WINDOW  Sidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...  INT.  BEDROOM  Sid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free, falling back onto the floor.                  VOICE             (o.c.)         Hey...it s just me.  Sid looks up to see...  BILLY LOOMIS  A young, strapping boy of seventeen.  Handsome and alluring.  A star quarterback/ class president type of guy.  He sports a smile that could last for days.                  SIDNEY         Billy? What the...                  BILLY         I m sorry. Don t hate me.                  SIDNEY         What are you doing here?                  BILLY         You sleep in THAT?  Billy pulls himself through the window.                  SIDNEY             (whispering)         My dad s in the other room.                  BILLY         I ll only stay a sec.  Suddenly...  The bedroom door BURSTS open.  The doorknob catches on the open closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.                  VOICE             (from behind door)         What s going on in there?  Billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams the door to reveal...  MR. PRESCOTT, late 40 s, a severe presence.  A distracted man, nervous and pre-occupied.                  MR. PRESCOTT         Are you okay?                  SIDNEY         Can you knock?                  MR. PRESCOTT         I heard screaming.                  SIDNEY         No you didn t.                  MR. PRESCOTT         No? Oh, well...I m hitting the sack. My         flight leaves first thing in the morning.         Now the expo runs all weekend so I         won t be back til Sunday. There s cash         on the table and I ll be staying at the         Raleigh Hilton...                  SIDNEY         ..out at the airport...                  MR. PRESCOTT         ..so call if you need me.                  SIDNEY         Got it.  He gives the bedroom a quick once over.                  MR. PRESCOTT         I coulda swore I heard screaming.  Sidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek.                  SIDNEY         Have a good trip.                  MR. PRESCOTT         Sleep tight, sweetie.  He gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.  Billy reappears.                  BILLY         Close call.                  SIDNEY         What are you doing here?  Billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed.                  BILLY         It just occurred to me that I ve never         snuck through your bedroom window.                  SIDNEY         Now that it s out of your system.                  BILLY         And I was home, bored, watching         television, THE EXORCIST was on         and it got me thinking of you.                  SIDNEY         Oh it did?                  BILLY         Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good         stuff was cut out and I started thinking         about us and how two years ago, we started         off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid  R          rating on our way to an NC17. And how         things have changed and, lately, we re just         sot of...edited for television.                  SIDNEY         So you thought you could sneak in my         window and we would  have little bump-         bump.                  BILLY         No, no. I wouldn t dream of breaking your         underwear rule. I just thought we might do         some on top of the clothes stuff.  She snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips. Passionate and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into her...Sidney breaks away.                  SIDNEY         Time to go, stud bucket.  Billy sits up.  His heart isn t racing...it s POUNDING.                  BILLY         See what you do to me.  Sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.                  SIDNEY         You know what my dad will do to you?                  BILLY         I m going...I m going.  He moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound.                  SIDNEY         I appreciate the romantic gesture.  She gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple.                  BILLY             (whisper)         Hey..about the sex stuff. I m not trying         to rush you. I was only half serious.  She kisses him again as he eases through the window.                  SIDNEY         Would you settle for a PG-13         relationship?                  BILLY         What s that?  She pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her left breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes meet.  They share a smile.                  SIDNEY         Get outa here.  INT.  SIDNEY S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING  CLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when...  THE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake the dead.  Sidney bolts up.                  DISC JOCKEY             (from radio)         ..found brutally murdered...  CLICK.  Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly. A car trunk SLAMS shut outside.  Sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at him but he doesn t see her.  He s as good as gone, pulling out of the driveway and disappearing down the road.  A moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.  EXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING  CLOSE ON A SIGN   BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS   THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town school.  Old and charming.  Students come and go, moving about. Nothing unusual, except for the...  six police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and crowds of lookie-loo s gathered just off campus.  EXT.  SIDEWALK  Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four different news reports.  She moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked, she stops at the first reporter who is...  GALE WEATHERS  Thirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a massive mane of chemically enhanced hair.                  GALE             (for the camera)         The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina         was devastated last night when two young         teenagers were found brutally butchered.         Authorities have yet to issue a statement         but our sources tell us that no arrest         has been made and the murderer could         strike again...  ON SIDNEY.  Moved, disturbed.  From behind, a finger taps her shoulder.  She spins around to see...  Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree.                  TATUM         Do you believe this shit?                  SIDNEY         What happened?  They break away from the crowd and head for school.                  TATUM         Oh God! You don t know? Casey Becker         and Steve Forrest were killed last night.                  SIDNEY         No way.                  TATUM         And not just killed, Sid. We re talking         splatter movie killed-split open end to         end.                  SIDNEY         Casey Becker? She sits next to me in         English.                  TATUM         Not anymore. Her parents found her         hanging from a tree. Her insides on the         outside.                  SIDNEY         Do they know who did it?                  TATUM         Fucking clueless-they re interrogating         the entire school. Teachers, students,         staff, janitors...                  SIDNEY         They think it s school-related?                  TATUM         They don t know. Dewey said this is         the worst crime they ve ever seen.         Even worse than...             (stopping herself)         Well it s bad. They re bringing in the         feds. This is big.  Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained.  INT.  CLASSROOM - LATER  A frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.  Her hands clasped together.  A tragic look upon her face.                  MRS. TATE         ..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable         loss. It s days like today we need         prayer in school...  Sidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her sits vacant.  Sidney can t take her eyes of it.  The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand s it to Mrs. Tate.                  MRS. TATE         Sidney. It appears to be your turn.  INT.  PRINCIPAL S OFFICE  The room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes. Some sit, stand, lean...  SHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from his face.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Who s up next?  A young officer looks at the clipboard.  This is DEPUTY RILEY, better known as DEWEY.  He s a big guy, 20 s, handsome in a scrubbed-clean boyish way.                  DEWEY         Sidney Prescott.  Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.  PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50 s, an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up.                  MR. HIMBRY         Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of...                  DEWEY         We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry.                  SHERIFF BURKE         How she doin ?                  MR. HIMBRY         She s adjusted well. Maintains an  A          average. You never know she...  Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.  He rises and seats her.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Hi Sidney.                  SIDNEY         Sheriff Burke. Dewey.  Dewey shakes his head seriously.                  DEWEY         It s Deputy Riley today, Sid.                  SHERIFF BURKE         How is everything?                  SIDNEY         Good.                  SHERIFF BURKE         And your Dad? How s he doing?                  SIDNEY         We re fine. Thanks.                  MR. HIMBRY         We ll be brief, Sidney. The police have a         few questions they d like to ask you...  Sidney eyes them all nervously.  EXT.  SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER  Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch.  Crowded at one table is the  gang .  This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.  Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped across her back.  He s a Billy wannabe.  Almost the jock, almost handsome, almost cool.  He tries way to hard.  Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY.  A tall and gangly kid with no such Billy-like aspirations.  A witty jokester who elevates geek to coolness.                  TATUM         Hunt? Why would they ask if you like         to hunt?                  STU         I don t know, they just did.                  RANDY         Because their bodies were gutted.  Sidney flinches.                  BILLY         Thanks Randy.                  TATUM         They didn t ask me if I like to hunt.                  STU         Because there s no way a girl could have         killed them.                  TATUM         That is so sexist. The killer could         easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.                  RANDY         That was an ice pick-not exactly the         same.                  STU         Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely         hollowed out. Takes a man to do         something like that.                  TATUM         Or a man s mentality.                  SIDNEY             (quiet, almost to herself)         How do you gut someone?  All eyes turn to Sidney.  A serious silence.  And then:                  STU         You take a knife and slit from the groin         to the sternum.  Sidney shivers down to her soul.  The whole table rolls their eyes at Stu.                  STU         What? She asked.                  BILLY         It s called tact, you fuckrag.                  STU         Sorry.                  RANDY         Remember in JAWS when they caught the         wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss         cut it open to look foe body parts and all         they found was a licence plate and all this         white milky goo.  Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm.                  STU         You heard Billy-shut the fuck up.                  SIDNEY         Hey, Stu? Didn t you use to date Casey?  Stu s taken back, a little off guard.                  STU         For about two seconds.                  RANDY         Before she dumped him foe Steve.  Tatum turns to Stu, surprised.                  TATUM         I thought you dumped her for me.                  STU         I did. He s full of shit.                  RANDY         And are the police aware you dated the         victim?                  STU             (offended)         What are you saying? That I killed         her or something?                  RANDY         It would certainly improve your high         school Q.                  TATUM         Stu was with me last night.                  RANDY         Oooooh...before or after he sliced and         diced.                  TATUM         Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last         night?                  RANDY         Working, thank you.                  TATUM         I thought Blockbuster fired you.                  RANDY         Twice.                  STU         I didn t kill anybody.                  BILLY         No one s saying you did.                  RANDY         Besides-             (perfect Stu mimic)          Takes a man to do something like that.                   STU         I m gonna gut your ass in a second.                  RANDY             (to Stu)         Did you really put her liver in the         mailbox? I hear they found her liver         in the mailbox.                  TATUM             (eyeing Sidney)         Randy, you goon-fuck, I m eating here.  Stu nibbles at Tatum s neck.                  STU         Yeah, Randy, she s getting mad. I think         you better liver alone.  Stu cracks up at his own joke.  The others just MOAN.  Sidney is about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.  EXT.  SIDNEY S HOUSE - LATER  A huge two story country home with a spacious lawn.  A yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps off.  The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the front door.  INT.  BEDROOM - LATER  Sidney is on the telephone.                  SIDNEY             (into phone)         You sure I can stay over?  My dad won t         be back til Sunday.                  TATUM             (through phone)         No prob. I ll pick you up after         practice.                  SIDNEY         Tell your mom I said thanks.                  TATUM         Yeah, yeah...are you okay?                  SIDNEY         Uh-huh, it s just...you know, the police         and reporters...it brings it all back.                  TATUM         I ll be there by seven. I promise                  SIDNEY         Thanks, Tatum.                  TATUM         Later.  Sidney hangs up.  She takes a seat at her computer and boots it up.  She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own reflection staring back.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER  Sidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of clothes, toothbrush, make-up...  She opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the top shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping down on the sofa, hitting the TV remote.  CLOSE ON THE SCREEN  A news reporter fades in.                  REPORTER #1             (on TV)         The entire nation was shocked today by         the teen murders in North Carolina...  Sidney switches channels.                  REPORTER #2         The State Bureau of Investigation has         joined forces with local authorities to         help catch what the Governor has called         the most heinous...  The channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in front of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming.                  GALE         This is not the first time the small town         of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only         a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and         mother, was found raped and murdered...  An old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman, beautiful and familiar.  CLOSE ON SIDNEY  eyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV off.  Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her eyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and white photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older version of Sidney.  Sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight...  INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER  The clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep on the couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone.                  TATUM             (from phone)         Practice ran late. I m on my way.                  SIDNEY             (eyes clock)         It s past seven.                  TATUM         Don t worry. Casey and Steve didn t bite         it til way after ten.                  SIDNEY         I m not worried.                  TATUM         Good,  cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER         and get us a video. I was thinkin  Tom Cruise in         ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you         pause it just right you can see his penis.                  SIDNEY         Whatever. Just hurry.                  TATUM         Bye.  She hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again.                  SIDNEY             (into phone)         Tatum?                  MAN S VOICE             (from phone)         Hello, Sidney.  IT S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE.                  SIDNEY         Hi. Who is this?                  MAN         You tell me.  Sidney thinks, trying to place his voice.  It sounds a little distorted.                  SIDNEY         I have no idea.                  MAN         Scary night, isn t it? With the murders         and all, it s like right out of a horror         movie or something.                  SIDNEY         Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are         you calling from work? Tatum s on her         way over.                  MAN         Do you like scary movies, Sidney?                  SIDNEY         I like that thing you re doing with your         voice, Randy. It s sexy.                  MAN         What s your favorite scary movie?                  SIDNEY         Don t start. You know I don t watch that         shit.                  MAN         And why is that?                  SIDNEY             (playing along)         Because they re all the same. It s         always some stupid killer stalking some         big breasted girl-who can t act-who         always runs up the stairs when she should         be going out the front door. They re         ridiculous.  A brief silence.                  MAN         Are you alone in the house?                  SIDNEY         That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,         Randy.                  MAN         Maybe that s because I m not Randy.                  SIDNEY         So who are you?                  MAN         The question is not who am I. The         question is where am I?                  SIDNEY         So where are you?                  MAN         Your front porch.  This gives her pause.  She moves to the window and pulls aside the drapes.                  SIDNEY         Why would you call me from my         front porch?                  MAN         That s the original part.  ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.  She can t quite see all of the porch.                  SIDNEY         Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.  Sidney goes to the front door.  She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...  COMPLETELY EMPTY.  She steps out onto it, phone still in hand.  A single light shines overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.  Darkness is all around.                  SIDNEY         So where are you?                  MAN         Right here.  Sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on either side of the porch.                  SIDNEY         Can you see me right now?                  MAN         Uh-huh.                  SIDNEY         What am I doing?  She sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.  Silence. No answer.                  SIDNEY         Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.         Bye now.                  MAN         If you hang up, you ll die just like your         mother.  Sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.                  MAN             (deadly)         Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother         didn t.  His seriousness unnerves her.  Sid flies off the handle.                  SIDNEY         FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!  She hangs up on him.  Moves back inside the house.  Locks, chains, and bolts the door when...  A FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET  rushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is on top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING...  She looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale, distorted face, white and ghostly...a mask.  Her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the contact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his hand finding her neck.  Suddenly, along, silver blade appears above her.  Sidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward knocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living room.  Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet.  She moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it catches on the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand. Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and...  RUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her.  INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING  The FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs madly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the wall swinging it behind her...  It catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending him backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her bedroom...  INT.  BEDROOM  She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing the edge right at the door knob just as...  THE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR...  ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a crazy vice-like hold.  Sidney grabs the desk phone.  It s dead...off the hook downstairs.  The figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but won t give.  Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly.  CLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR.          FAX MODEM          9-1-1 SEND  The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.  ON SCREEN AGAIN          HELP KILLER          34 ELM ST  Sidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The FIGURE is gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only sound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING.  ON THE SCREEN           Stay calm.  Police enroute.   Suddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see...  BILLY  her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised.                  SIDNEY         Oh Billy...Please...God...                  BILLY         I heard screaming. The door was locked.         Are you okay...                  SIDNEY         He s here. He s trying to kill me...  Billy pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black object falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney eyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone.  Sidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A SIREN is heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts...                  BILLY         Hey...wait...what s goin..  Billy reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears out of the room.  INT.  LANDING  Sidney nearly falls down the stairs...  INT.  FOYER  She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to face with a white, ghostly mask. A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as...  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK  to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens BLAST vas car after car surrounds the house.  Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey s arms.  EXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER  The yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars, cops everywhere...  CLOSE ON BILLY S FACE  as it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are being cuffed, his rights being read.                  BILLY             (screaming)         I didn t do anything! Sid...where s Sid?         Ask her, she ll tell ya...  Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out.                  DEWEY         We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Hank Loomis  kid? Aw..Jesus...                  DEWEY         He s her boyfriend.  They approach Billy as he s being placed in a squad car.                  BILLY         Sheriff...I didn t do it...please, call         my Dad..please...  The squad car disappears with Billy as another car comes to a stop in front of the house.  Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief.  Back to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard.                  DEWEY         I was first to respond.                  SHERIFF BURKE         What were you doing out here?                  DEWEY         Drive by patrol.                  SHERIFF BURKE         How is she?                  DEWEY         She s tough.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Have to be. The shit she s gone through.  Across the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as PARAMEDICS check her out.  Sheriff Burke and Riley approach.                  SHERIFF BURKE         We re seeing a lot of you today.  She tries to smile but fails.                  DEWEY         You gonna be able to come down to the         station and talk to us a bit?                  SIDNEY         ..yeah...  TATUM appears, barreling past an OFFICER.                  TATUM         What happened? Oh God...  Tatum rushes to her, grabbing hold of her.                  DEWEY             (to Tatum)         What are you doing here?                  TATUM         Oh, God, Sid, I m sorry I was late.                  DEWEY         You can t be here, Tatum. This is an         official crime scene.                  SIDNEY         It s okay. She was supposed to pick me         up.                  TATUM         Her dad s out of town. She s staying         with us.                  DEWEY         Does mom know?                  TATUM         Yes, you doofus.  Two news vans come driving up the street.                  SHERIFF BURKE         The vultures are coming. Let s get you         out of here.  EXT.  STREET  A big, white news van comes to a stop in front of the house.  The side door slides open and Gale Weathers hops out just in time to see Sidney being escorted to a squad car.                  GALE         I ll be damned.  Jumping from the driver s seat is KENNY, Gale s cameraman and flunky.  An earnest young chap on the chubby side.                  KENNY         What? What?                  GALE         Jesus! The camera-hurry!  But it s too late.  Sidney is as good as gone.  Gale sees Tatum moving quickly to her car.                  GALE         Excuse me?  Tatum looks up to see Gale Weathers rushing her.                  GALE         Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?                  TATUM         I don t know.  Tatum hops in her car, ignoring her.                  GALE         What happened to her?                  TATUM         I m not talking to you.  Tatum s car peels out as Kenny comes running up with his camera.                  KENNY         Where d she go?  Gale spins around, flashing her pearly whites.                  GALE         Look, Kenny, I know you re about fifty         pounds overweight but when I say hurry         please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR         FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW!  Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed.  INT.  POLICE STATION  A small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with four desks and tonight--it s hopping.  Cops everywhere.  INT.  SHERIFF S OFFICE  Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the Sheriff s jacket over her shoulders.  Dewey approaches.                  SIDNEY         Did you reach my Dad?                  DEWEY         You re sure it was the Hilton?                  SIDNEY         At the airport.                  DEWEY         He s not registered. Could he have gone         to another hotel?                  SIDNEY         I don t know. I guess.                  DEWEY         We ll find him, Sid. Don t worry.  Sidney stares blankly, numb.  INT.  SHERIFF S OFFICE  Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke.  Next to Billy, sits his father, HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy.                  SHERIFF BURKE         What are you doing with a cellular         telephone, son?                  MR. LOOMIS         It s my phone. He was just playing         around with it.                  SHERIFF BURKE         You got some ideas of playing around, boy.                  BILLY         I didn t call anyone with it. I just         took it for fun.                  MR. LOOMIS         Everybody s got one now. Why don t you         check the phone bill for chrissakes.         Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They ll         have records of every number dialed.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Thank you, Hank. We re on it. What were         you doing out at Sidney s tonight?                  BILLY         I just wanted to see her, that s all.                  SHERIFF BURKE         You rode your bike out there?                  BILLY         Yes, sir.                  SHERIFF BURKE         And last night? Sidney said you crawled         through her window last night too?                  MR. LOOMIS             (surprised)         You were out last night?                  BILLY         I watched TV for awhile but the I felt         like going for a bike ride.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Did you ride past Casey Becker s house?                  BILLY         No, I didn t. I didn t kill anyone,         Sheriff.                  SHERIFF BURKE         We re gonna have to keep you, Billy. The         governor s got SBI, FBI, and god knows         who else on their way down here.  Billy fights tears.                  BILLY         This is crazy. I didn t do it.  Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully.  INT.  POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER  Tatum has joined Sidney.  The sheriff s door opens and Billy is led out by a coupla UNIFORMS.  Burke and Dewey appear in the door watching Tatum comfort Sidney.  OUT OF EAR SHOT                  DEWEY         That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger s         and WalMart. Neither of which keep         purchase records.                  SHERIFF BURKE         What about the cellular phone bill?                  DEWEY         They re pulling Loomis  account. But         it ll be morning before we see something.         You think he did it?                  SHERIFF BURKE         Twenty years ago I woulda said not a         chance. But these kids today...damn if I         know.                  TATUM             (o.s.)         Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?                  DEWEY         Hold up a sec...                  SHERIFF BURKE         She staying with you?                  DEWEY         We haven t located her Dad yet.                  TATUM             (o.s.)         Goddammit, Dewey!  Dewey turns to her, his face red.                  DEWEY         What did Mama tell you? When I wear this         badge you treat me like a man of the law.                  TATUM         I m sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we re         ready to go.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Use the back way. Avoid the circus.  EXT.  POLICE STATION - SIDE DOOR  The door opens and Sidney, Tatum, Dewey, and a coupla OFFICERS exit avoiding the horde of REPORTERS that can be seen around the corner waiting anxiously at the front entrance.                  DEWEY         I ll get the car. Wait here.  Dewey takes off.  From the darkness of the alley, Gale Weathers appears with Kenny and his camera.  They ve been waiting.                  GALE         Hello Sidney.  Sidney spins around to see Gale, standing, smiling at her. Sidney s body tightens and her face goes taut.                  GALE         Some night. Are you alright?  Their eyes meet in cold familiar stare.  Sidney says nothing. She s visibly shaking.                  GALE         What happened?                  TATUM         She s not answering any questions. Just         leave us alone, okay?                  SIDNEY         It s okay, Tatum. She s just doing her         job. Right, GALE?                  GALE         Yes, that s right.  Dewey, in a squad car, turns into the alley and pulls up.  The other news people have wisened up.  They begin to flock the alley.                  SIDNEY         How s the book?                  GALE         It ll be out later this year.  Sidney tries to contain herself..squeezing a clenched fist.                  SIDNEY         I ll look for it.                  GALE         I ll send you a copy.  In a blurred, unexpected instant, Sidney brings her fist forward, SMASHING it hard into Gale Weathers s face.  The impact sends Gale reeling backwards, knocking into Kenny as they both tumble to the pavement.  ON SIDNEY...breathing deep, a sense of satisfaction on her face.  INT.  TATUM S BEDROOM - LATER  A spacious bedroom.  Typical.  Tatum and Sidney lay on the bed. They both wear night shirts.                  TATUM         God, I loved it.  I ll send you a copy.          BAM! Bitch went down.  I ll send you a         copy.  BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!  Dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice.                  DEWEY         I thought you might want some ice for         that right hook.  Sidney sits up, takes the ice, and puts it on her hand.                  DEWEY         I ll be right next door. Try to get some         sleep.  Dewey moves back out the door.                  SIDNEY         Any word on my Dad?                  DEWEY             (turning to her)         Not yet, but we re looking. If you need         anything...                  TATUM         Yeah, yeah, yeah...  Dewey smiles, pulling the door closed on his way out.  Sidney lies back down.                  SIDNEY         Just another sleepover at the Riley s.                  TATUM         Just like old times, ain t it?                  SIDNEY         No, nothing s like it used to be.  Sidney rolls over at her side, away from Tatum.  A telephone RINGS somewhere in the house.                  TATUM         Do you really think Billy did it?                  SIDNEY         He was there, Tatum.                  TATUM         I knew this guy was too perfect. He was         destined to have a flaw.  A KNOCK at the door.  It opens and a friendly, graying woman pops in.  This is MAMA RILEY.  She wears a comforting smile.                  MAMA RILEY         Telephone, dear.                  TATUM         Who is it?                  MAMA RILEY         It s for Sid                  SIDNEY         My Dad?  Mama Riley shakes her head sadly.                  TATUM         Take a message.                  SIDNEY         It s alright. I ll get it.  Sidney takes off out the door.  Mama Riley motions to Tatum.                  MAMA RILEY             (whispers)         How is she?  Tatum shrugs.  INT.  HALLWAY  Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall.                  SIDNEY         Hello?                  MAN             (from phone)         Hello Sidney.  IT S HIM.  The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney s entire body goes weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.  She CRIES OUT.                  SIDNEY         NOOOOOO...  Mama Riley turns in the doorway.  Tatum comes bolting out of the bedroom.                  MAN             (from phone)         Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy         doesn t stand a chance with you.                  SIDNEY         LEAVEMEALONE!                  MAN         Looks like you fingered the wrong         guy...again.                  SIDNEY         Who are you?                  TATUM         Hang up, Sid.                  MAN         Don t worry. You ll find out soon         enough. I promise.  Mama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door.                  MAMA RILEY         Dewey! Dewey!                  MAN         This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like         old times.  CLICK.  Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his gun.                  DEWEY         What? What?  The phone goes dead.  Sidney stands frozen.  EXT.  BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING  The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.  Cars come to life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens from a restless sleep.  INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING  Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.  A small television sits on the counter BLARING.  Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone.                  MAMA RILEY         I think you girls really should stay home         today.                  TATUM         Your objection is duly noted.                  SIDNEY         I d rather be around a lot of people,         Mama Riley.  From the TV, Sidney hears her name,  SIDNEY PRESCOTT...   All eyes go to the television.                  REPORTER             (on TV)         ..who escaped a vicious attack last night         was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who         was brutally killed last year when         convicted murderer Cotton Weary...  INSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.  A once handsome man, now haggard and worn.                  REPORTER             (cont d)         ..broke into their home and savagely         raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton         Weary is currently awaiting appeal for         the death sentence handed down after the         young Sidney testified against him. She         was the key witness in the state s         prosecution...                  SIDNEY         It s never gonna stop. Is it?  Dewey is off the phone.                  DEWEY         Billy was released. His cellular bill         was clean. He didn t make those calls.                  SIDNEY         Somebody called me, Dewey. I m not         making it up.                  DEWEY         I know. We re checking every cellular         account in the county. Any calls made to         you or Casey Becker are being cross-         referenced. It s gonna take time but         we ll find him.                  SIDNEY         And my Dad? Any word on him?  Riley shakes his head  no .  EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - LATER  Once again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that teenage insight.  Dewey s patrol jeep cruises by.  Sidney watches from the passenger s window.  INT.  PATROL CAR  Dewey pulls up in front of the school.  Tatum hops out while Sid lingers, suddenly unsure.  Dewey takes notice.                  DEWEY         Hey, it s school. You ll be safe here.  Sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in her face...                  REPORTER         How does it feel to almost be brutally         murdered?  Dewey leaps from the car, intercepting the reporter.                  DEWEY         Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants         to go to school.  Sidney eyes the newsvan that s pulled up behind her.  The side door slides open and Gale Weathers steps out.                  TATUM         Come on, Sid.                  SIDNEY         Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.  She heads over to Gale.  EXT.  NEWSVAN - STREET  Sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face...avoiding other reporters as she makes her way to...  Gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror. Makeup tries hard to hide Sid s handwork-a swollen black and blue right cheek.  Gale spots Sidney immediately and leaps to her feet.                  GALE         Stop right there.  Sidney throws her hands up in surrender.                  SIDNEY         I m not here to fight.                  GALE         Just stay back.                  SIDNEY         I want to talk to you.                  GALE             (calling into the van)         Kenny. Camera. Now.  Kenny s head darts out from the van.                  SIDNEY         Off the record. No cameras.                  GALE         Forget it.  Sidney contains herself.                  SIDNEY         Please. You owe me.                  GALE         I owe you shit.  Gale moves inside the van.  But Sidney is relentless.                  SIDNEY         You owe my mother.                  GALE         Your mother s murder was last year s         hottest court case. Somebody was gonna         write a book about it.                  SIDNEY         And it had to be you with all your lies         and bullshit theories.                  GALE         What is your problem? You got what you         wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail.         They re gonna gas him. A book is not         gonna change that.                  SIDNEY         Do you still think he s innocent?  Gale s interest is peaked.  She eyes Sidney suspiciously.                  GALE         He was convicted in a court of law. Your         testimony put him away. It doesn t         matter what I think.                  SIDNEY         During the trial, you did all those         stories about me. You called me a liar.                  GALE         I think you falsely identified him. Yes.                  SIDNEY         Have you talked to Cotton?                  GALE         Many times.                  SIDNEY         Has his story changed?                  GALE         Not one word. He admits to having sex         with your mother but that s all.                  SIDNEY         He s lying. She wouldn t have touched         him. He raped her, then butchered her.         Her blood was all over his coat.                  GALE         He was drunk that night. He left his         coat at your house, after your mother         seduced him...                  SIDNEY         I saw him leaving wearing it.                  GALE         But couldn t it have been someone else         you saw wearing that coat? The same         person who planted it in Cotton s car,         framing him? The same person who         really killed your mother?  A long beat.  Sidney considers this for the millionth time.                  SIDNEY         No, Cotton murdered my mother.  But there s doubt in her voice.  Gale s face lights up.                  GALE         You re not so sure anymore, are you?  Sidney clams up.                  SIDNEY         No, it was Cotton.  Tatum comes waltzing up.                  TATUM             (to GALE)         Nice welt.  Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing.                  GALE         The killer is still on the loose, isn t         he? These murders are related.                  TATUM         Yo--let s rock.  Sidney starts to fidget.                  SIDNEY         I m sorry I mangled your face.  She take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her.                  GALE         Wait, Sidney, don t go...  But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus.  Gale looks to Kenny.                  GALE         Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death         row. A killer still on the loose.         Kenny, tell me I m dreaming.                  KENNY         You want to go live?  Gale s mind races with possibilities.                  GALE         No, not so fast. We have nothing         concrete.                  KENNY         When did that ever stop you? You can t         sit on this. This is huge.                  GALE         If I m gonna blow this up-I need hard         proof.                  KENNY         But it s so much easier when we make it         up.                  GALE         Not this time. I owe Cotton that much.         Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.  EXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER  Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus.                  TATUM         Just relax. You re at school now. No         one can get you here.                  SIDNEY         But if it wasn t Billy it could be         anybody. He could be here at school         right now.  They move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them, sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK.                  TATUM         Serial killers are smart by definition.         They minimize their risk. They plan and         pre-calculate everything. Showing up         here would be the most lame-brain         move he could make.                  SIDNEY         He promised me he d be back.  As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site, unseen by either of them.                  TATUM         I wouldn t put too much stock in a         psycho s promise.  They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks.  She steps back, spinning around to find...  A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up LAUGHING, tearing off across campus.  EXT.  STREET  In front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote. He holds a mask in his hand.                  REPORTER         This morning several students, in what         appears to be a prank, have been spotted         wearing masks. School officials have yet         to comment but this is the same type of         mask worn by the killer...  INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER  Just before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students heading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney.                  SIDNEY         This is a mistake. I shouldn t be here.                  TATUM         I want you to meet me here right after         class, okay?  Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots him first.                  TATUM         Shit, what is he doing here?                  SIDNEY         I bet he s pissed.                  TATUM         Just ignore him. You had good reason to         think what you did.  Billy and Stu approach.  Billy s face is solemn.                  BILLY         Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?  Sidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum intervenes.                  TATUM         You know if I were accused of carving up         two people, I d take the opportunity to         skip school.                  STU         Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn t do it.                  BILLY         Talk to me, Sid.  Suddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck.                  SIDNEY         Why are they doing this?                  STU         Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.  Billy punches Stu in the side.                  STU         Owwww...                  BILLY         You open your mouth and stupidity pours         out.                  STU         Sorry.  Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off after her.                  TATUM             (yelling)         Stay away from her, Billy.  Tatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS.  INT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER  With first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two struggling students can be seen rushing to class.  Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running smack into...  BILLY  They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out of her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall.                  SIDNEY         Jesus, SHIT!                  BILLY         Hey, hey, it s just me.  Sidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight.                  BILLY         What? You don t still think it s me?  Sidney catches her breath.                  SIDNEY         No...I don t...it s just...Oh God, Billy,         someone was there, someone tried to         kill me.                  BILLY         The police say I scared him off. It         wasn t me, Sid.                  SIDNEY         I know. He called again last night at         Tatum s house.                  BILLY         See, it couldn t have been me. I was in         jail, remember?                  SIDNEY         I m so sorry...please understand.                  BILLY         Understand what? That I got a girlfriend         who would rather accuse me of being a         psychopathic killer than touch me.                  SIDNEY         You know that s not true.                  BILLY         Then what is it? Is there somebody else?                  SIDNEY         No...                  BILLY         Is it the sex thing? Am I being too         pushy?                  SIDNEY         No, it s me, Billy. I need time. I m         still adjusting to my mom.                  BILLY         It s been a year since she died.                  SIDNEY             (correcting him)         Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.                  BILLY         When are you gonna let that go, Sid?         When my mom left my dad--I just accepted         it. This is the way it is. She s not coming         back.                  SIDNEY             (sharply)         Your parents split up. It s not the same         thing. Your mom left town, she s not in         a coffin somewhere.                  BILLY         You have to move on, Sid.  Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.                  SIDNEY         I m glad to know you re coping so well         with life, Billy. But some of us aren t so         perfect. Some of us are just trying to         hold on.  Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRL S BATHROOM, leaving Billy alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at himself.  INT.  GIRL S BATHROOM  Large and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle and talk--each from their respective stalls.                  GIRL #1         She was never attacked. I think she made         it all up.                  GIRL #2         Why would she lie about it?                  GIRL #1         For attention. The girl has some serious         issues.  Sidney listens intently.  A toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just as GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a snotty little twit.                  GIRL #1         What if she did it? What if Sidney         killed Casey and Steve?                  GIRL #2         And why would she do that?                  GIRL #1         Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed         them both in a jealous rage.  Another toilet FLUSHES.                  GIRL #2         Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?         She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.                  GIRL #1         Maybe she s a slut just like her mom.  INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening.                  GIRL #2         You re evil.                  GIRL #1         Please, it s common knowledge. Her         mother was a trollop.  GIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.                  GIRL #2         Cut some slack. She watched her mom get         butchered.                  GIRL #1         And it fucked her up royally. Think         about it. It makes perfect sense. Her         mom s death leaves her distraught and         hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,         she s disillusioned, where s God, etc.         Completely suicidal. And one day she         snaps. She wants to kill herself but         realizes teen suicide is out this year.         And homicide is a much healthier         therapeutic expression.  From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.                  GIRL #2         Where do you get this shit?                  GIRL #1         Ricki Lake.  The two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her reflection in the mirror.                  SIDNEY         Pathetic.  Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like a whisper,    Siddneey...   Sidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom. The doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans beneath them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing.  Sidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly...                  MAN             (o.c. whisper)         Siddneey...  Unmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail through the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.                  SIDNEY         Is someone there?  A long, morose silence.  And then:                  MAN             (softly, simply)         It s me, Sidney.  Sidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE S HERE.  Terror floods her face.  She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it.  She checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is he?  She takes a step forward when...  TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall. Sidney s face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open. She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her feet flying out from under...  Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her. A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit door...narrowly escaping.  INT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS  Sidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the hallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer out from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not stopping...running madly.  INT.  PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS  CLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot act.  MR. HIMBRY I m sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me.  The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS standing at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the student s heads.                  MR. HIMBRY         Two students have been savagely murdered.         And this is how we express our compassion         and sensivity?  He rips the mask off the other student.                  MR. HIMBRY         We throw on a mask and dance around         campus just hoping someone else gets         butchered before we get bored again.         You re both expelled.  The GHOSTS doth protest...                  GHOST #1         Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a         joke.                  GHOST #2         Yeah, that s not fair.  A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry s face.  Neither student budges, scared to even breathe.                  MR. HIMBRY         No, it s not fair. Fairness would be to         rip your insides out and hang you from         a tree so you can be exposed for the         desensitized, heartless little shits that         you are.  Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.                  SIDNEY             (crying)         He s here...I saw him...he s here...  Mr. Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.                  MR. HIMBRY         Easy child.  Sidney collapses in his arms.  EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER  Dewey s patrol jeep is parked in front of the school.  He stands in the open driver s door talking on the radio.                  SHERIFF BURKE             (from radio)         She s okay. Looks like some boys were         teasing her. Himbry s shutting down the         school though. I want you to take look         around.                  DEWEY         Yes, sir, sheriff.  Dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers appears, her fake face aglow.                  GALE         Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,         INSIDE STORY.                  DEWEY         I know who you are, ma am. How s the         eye?                  GALE         Productive. So they re closing down the         school?                  DEWEY         Well..uh...yes ma am. For the time being.  Dewey heads for the school building. Gale scurries along side him flirtatiously.                  GALE         And why is that? Has something happened?                  DEWEY         You re not supposed to be here, ma am.                  GALE         I know, I should be in New York covering         the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?         Please, call me Gale. You look awfully         young to be a police officer.  Dewey s eyes wander down to Gale s long legs, the way her hips move as she walks...he s clearly distracted.                  DEWEY         I m twenty-five years old, ma am.                  GALE         Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study         I proved to be most popular amongst         males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,         you don t look a day over twelve, except         in the upper torso area. Does the force         require that you work out?  Dewey looks away, blushing a bit.                  DEWEY         No, ma am. Because of my boyish good         looks, muscle mass has increased my         acceptance as a serious police officer.  They approach the school s front entrance.  Suddenly, Mr. Himbry s VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA system.  They stop to listen.                  MR. HIMBRY             (via PA)          Your attention please. Due to the         recent events that have occurred and         until it comes to a resolve--effective         immediately--all classes are suspended         til further notice. The Bayboro Police         Dept. has also asked me to announce a         city wide curfew beginning at 6 o clock         PM. I repeat...   Gale speaks over Mr. Himbry s voice.                  GALE         Boy, you people sure do make fuss over         a serial killer.                  DEWEY         Serial killer is not really accurate,         ma am. The killer has yet to strike         twice.                  GALE         Well, we can hope, can t we? We         certainly don t have any leads. A ghost         mask, a cellular phone--not much there.                  DEWEY         We re tracking the cellular phone bill.                  GALE         Really? You small town guys are good.         And have you located Sidney s father?                  DEWEY         No, not yet.                  GALE         He s not a suspect, is he?                  DEWEY         We haven t ruled out that possibil...  Dewey, realizing he s said too much, clams up.                  DEWEY         If you ll excuse me, ma am.                  GALE         Am I keeping you? I m sorry.                  DEWEY         That s quite alright. If I may say so,         ma am, you re much prettier in person.  Dewey starts up the school s front steps as the bell RINGS.                  GALE         So you do watch the show?  He turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front doors.                  DEWEY         I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole         year.                  GALE         You are precious. Please, call me Gale.  She smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as Dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.  INT.  SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER  School is clearing out.  The halls have begun to empty as Tatum escorts Sidney down the hallway.                  TATUM         It was just some sick fuck having a         laugh.                  SIDNEY         It was him, Tatum. I know it.  Tatum wants to believe her but...                  TATUM         You are not to be alone again. Is that         clear? If you pee--I pee.  Stu appears.                  STU         Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,         what happened?                  TATUM         For once, Stu, drop it.                  STU         Okay, but whatever you did--the entire         student body thanks you.  Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss.                  STU         And to celebrate this impromptu fall         break, I propose we have a party.         Tonight, my house.                  SIDNEY         Are you serious?                  STU         My parents are out of town. It ll be         like my hurricane bash last year.         Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,         hangin .  Tatum warms to the idea.                  TATUM         This could be good. What do you think,         Sid?                  SIDNEY         I don t know...                  TATUM         Come on. Pathos has it s perks.  Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.                  STU         Remember, there s safety in numbers.                  SIDNEY             (giving in)         Yeah, okay...whatever.                  STU         Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.  Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.  INT.  PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - LATER  Mr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him.  He picks one of them up, snickering.                  MR. HIMBRY         Damn...  He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when...  A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head, turns to his office door and opens it to reveal...  AN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around.  But no one s there.                  MR. HIMBRY         Yes? Hello?  The place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the mask in his hands.  Jesus, even he s jumpy.  Two seconds later...  ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open.  Again no one s there.  He steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster.  INT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS  Completely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and into the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and down the hall.  Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a broom.                  MR. HIMBRY         Little shits.  Mr. Himbry returns to his office.  INT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS  Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT.  This gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn t he?  Suddenly, he can t remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling the door open to reveal...  AN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door. Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal...  NOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he s spooked himself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut when...  A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand. Quick and easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes down.  The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him.  EXT.  TATUM S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER  The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing.  Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood.  Dewey s patrol jeep is parked in the driveway.  Despite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet moment.                  TATUM         Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.         Maybe he was having an affair with your         mom.                  SIDNEY         So you think my mom was a slut too?                  TATUM         I didn t say that, Sid. But you know         there were rumors. Your dad was         always out of town on business.         Maybe your mom was a very unhappy         woman.                  SIDNEY         If they were having an affair how come         that Cotton couldn t prove it in court?                  TATUM         You can t prove a rumor. That s why it s         a rumor.                  SIDNEY         Created by that little tabloid twit Gale         Weathers.                  TATUM             (delicately)         It goes further back, Sid. There s been         talk about other men.                  SIDNEY         And you believe it?                  TATUM         Well...you can only hear that Richard         Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.  A long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this.  She stands up and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the neighborhood.                  SIDNEY         If I was wrong Cotton, then he s still         out there.                  TATUM         Don t go there, Sid. You re starting to         sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.         Don t freak yourself out--we ve got a         long night ahead of us.                  SIDNEY         You re right. I m cracking up. Ignore         me.                  TATUM         Come on, let s rock.  Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED FIGURE that stands across the street, under a tree.  His presence so subtle and unobtrusive you d have to see this movie a second time to know he was there all along.  EXT.  MAIN STREET - LATER  Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next to him.                  BILLY         How d you do?                  STU         Piece of cake. She ll be there.                  BILLY         Thanks, butt wart. You did good.                  STU         So you gonna try and make up with Sid?                  BILLY         Duh...that s quick.                  STU         I was just asking. Why are you always at         me?                  BILLY         Because I m trying to build your self-         esteem. You re far too sensitive.                  STU         Oh....  Billy thumbs Stu s forehead.                  BILLY         You ready to party hard tonight?                  STU         You know it.  They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main Street.  A huge, blue monstrosity that s bigger than the local bank and post office combined. The sign in front reads BLOCKBUSTER.  INT.  BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS  You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded.  Randy, in his Blockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears-- knocking the videos out of his hand.                  STU         Jesus, this place is packed.                  RANDY             (picking up videos)         We had a run in the mass murder section.                  STU         You coming tonight?                  RANDY         Yeah, I m off early--curfew you know.             (looking off)         Now that s poor taste.                  STU         What?  Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO GIRLS.  (The twits from the bathroom perhaps.)                  RANDY         If you were the only suspect in a         senseless bloodbath would you be standing         in the horror section?                  STU         It was all a misunderstanding. He didn t         do anything.                  RANDY         You re such a little lap dog. He s got         killer printed all over his forehead.                  STU         The why d the police let him go?                  RANDY         Because, obviously they don t watch         enough movies. This is standard horror         movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.  Randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.                  STU         Why would he want to kill his own         girlfriend?                  RANDY         There s always some stupid bullshit         reason to kill your girlfriend. That s         the beauty of it all. Simplicity.         Besides, if it s too complicated you lose         your target audience.                  STU         So what s his reason?                  RANDY         Maybe Sidney wouldn t have sex with him.                  STU         She s saving herself for you.                  RANDY         Could be. Now that Billy s tried to         mutilate her, you think Sid would go out         with me?                  STU         I think her father did it. How come they         can t find his ass?                  RANDY         Because he s probably dead. His body         will come popping out in the last reel         somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police         are always off track with this shit, if they d         watch PROM NIGHT they d save time.         There s formula to it. A very simple one.         Everyone s always a suspect--the father,         the principal, the town derelict...                  STU         Which is you...                  RANDY         So while they re off investigating a dead         end, Billy, who s been written off as a         suspect, is busy planning his next         hunting expedition.                  BILLY             (o.c.)         How do we know you re not the killer?  Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted.                  RANDY         Uh...hi, Billy.                  BILLY         Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it s         reality button?  Randy shrugs, laughing it off.                  RANDY         You re absolutely right. I m the first         to admit it. If this were a scary movie,         I d be the prime suspect.                  STU         And what would be your motive?                  RANDY         It s 1995--motives are incidental.  EXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER  Dewey s patrol jeep makes it s way down mainstreet.  It s almost dark.  The street is close to deserted.  INT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS  Dewey s behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum while Sid stares out the window.                  DEWEY         A party? Mom s gonna kill you. Then me.                  TATUM         Don t be so self-righteous. It s just a         little blow out--we ll be perfectly safe.  Sid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew.                  SIDNEY         God, look at this place, it s THE TOWN         THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.                  DEWEY         Hey, I saw that movie. True story,  bout         some killer in Texas.                  TATUM         Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a         movie about you. Who s gonna play you?                  SIDNEY         Oh, god...  Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police station. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile.                  DEWEY         I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.                  SIDNEY         Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they d         cast Tori Spelling.  EXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS  They pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station.                  DEWEY         I ll just be a few minutes. Don t go         far.  The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the street.                  SIDNEY         Is Billy going to be there tonight?                  TATUM         He better not be. I told Stu to keep his         mouth shut. I think we can live without         EVERYBODY S ALL AMERICAN for         one night.  They approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the cart through two sliding glass doors.  A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up from counting money.                  CHECK OUT LADY         You girls gonna have to hurry it up.         We re under curfew.                  TATUM         Two minutes tops.  They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the automated doors slide shut behind them and a...  GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows.  EXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF S OFFICE  Sheriff Burke s face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in, hurriedly.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?                  DEWEY         Keeping my eye on Sidney.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Listen up, Dewey, because it s bad. Real         bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls         were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney s         father. He made the calls with his cellular         phone. It s confirmed.                  DEWEY         Couldn t his cellular number have been         cloned?                  SHERIFF BURKE         There s more. Guess what tomorrow is?         The anniversary of his wife s death. It all         fits. He s our man.                  DEWEY         Have you contacted the bureau?                  SHERIFF BURKE         They believe he s out of state by now.         We ll keep roadblocks and curfew in         effect through the night. If he s not         picked up by morning--we ll do a house         to house.                  DEWEY         You think he could still be in town?                  SHERIFF BURKE         He d have to be crazy. Where s Sidney?                  DEWEY         She s with my sister. Should I bring her         in?                  SHERIFF BURKE         Hold off for now. Just stay close to         her.                  DEWEY         She ll be with her friends over at Stu         Maker s tonight.                  SHERIFF BURKE         Watch her. Don t let on--just keep your         eyes out.                  DEWEY         Yes, sir.  INT.  SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER  Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section.  The store is completely empty.  The girls gab freely.                  SIDNEY         Billy s right. Whenever he touches me, I         just can t relax.                  TATUM         You have a few intimacy issues as a         result of your mother s untimely death.         It s no big deal. You ll thaw out.                  SIDNEY         But he s been so patient with me, Tatum.         You know, with all the sex stuff. How         many guys would put up with a girlfriend         who s sexually anorexic?                  TATUM         Billy and his penis don t deserve you.  Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf.  Down the aisle, through the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands watching their every move.  EXT.  SUPERMARKET  Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it. The GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found.                  SIDNEY         What do you think about when you re         having sex?                  TATUM         With Stu, there s little time to stop and         reflect. But sometimes before, to relax         and get in the mood, I think about Grant         Goodeve.  Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street.                  SIDNEY         Who?                  TATUM         Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on         EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He         was the one who lived off alone. He would come         around every now and then with his guitar and         sing  Eight is enough to fill our lives with love...          He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot         brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I         was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show         came on every day after school right during my         puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental         in my maturing as a woman.                  SIDNEY         How does that get you in the mood with         Stu?                  TATUM         During foreplay, I sing the theme song to         myself.  Eight is enough to fill our lives         with love...  It s a real turn on.                  SIDNEY         No way.                  TATUM         Grant wrote the song himself. I m         convinced the lyrics had a secret         meaning,  Eight is enough...   Sid pushes the cart up to Dewey s jeep.  Tatum hops off.                  SIDNEY         What secret meaning? Like a Satanical         thing?                  TATUM         Watch the show, Sid. His basket is         bigger than the one you re pushing.                  SIDNEY         TATUM!                  TATUM         Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits         til he s dead but the minute you mention         an eight inch weenie. Watch out.  Sidney stops just short of a laugh.  Tatum pulls the back jeep door, loading the groceries in.  Behind her, the GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep s open back door.                  TATUM         There s that sense of humor. I knew it         still existed. Ohh, Sid, let s have some         fun tonight.                  SIDNEY         Deal.  Sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from behind...  DEWEY stands.  Sid jumps, startled.                  DEWEY         You girls ready.                  SIDNEY         Yeah.                  DEWEY         Looks like I m your personal bodyguard         tonight, Sid.                  TATUM         No, Dewey. You ll ruin the whole night.                  DEWEY         Sorry, police orders. I ll stay out of the         way, I promise.                  TATUM         Shit.  Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly.  It rolls down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack into the GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one hand.  EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT  Dewey s jeep makes it s way down a long, winding road.  Headlights illuminate the thick woods that line each side.  Following behind them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan.  Dewey comes to the end of the road.  It dead ends at...  STU S HOUSE which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with no neighbors in sight.  A huge old home just ripe for a night of fun and...terror.  From the looks of things the party has already started.  Music is BLARING. A few KIDS hang on the porch.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER  A big room with KIDS sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking, cutting up.  A stereo BLASTS music while the TV airs around the clock killer coverage.  Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them.                  TATUM         Caterer s here.  The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink drinking beer through a funnel.                  TATUM         That s mature.                  STU         Where you guys been? We had to start         without you.  EXT.  STU S HOUSE - ROAD  The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the road a few feet down from the front yard.  INT.  NEWSVAN  Kenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a control panel complete with video monitors.                  KENNY         What s the plan?                  GALE         Prep the compact, we ll hide it in a         window and tape all of tonight s         festivities.  Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He checks its battery pack.                  KENNY         The control board s glitched. You know         we can t carry a live picture.                  GALE         What s the delay?                  KENNY         About thirty seconds.                  GALE         As long as it records I don t give a         shit. We re not doing a remote.  Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness, not seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her shoulder, Gale s heart stops as she spins around to find...  Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her.                  DEWEY         Evening, ma am.                  GALE         Deputy...good evening.                  DEWEY         What brings you out to these parts?                  GALE         You never know when or where a story will         break.                  DEWEY         Not much story here. Just a bunch of         kids cutting loose.                  GALE         Then what are you doing here?                  DEWEY         Keeping an eye on things. Checking the         place out.                  GALE         Mind if I join you?  Dewey considers for a whole two seconds.                  DEWEY         Not at all.  Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny s hand, and throws it in her bag.  She gives Kenny a wink.  INT.  KITCHEN  CLOSE ON a microwave.  Popcorn POPS inside.  CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL...  Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk food feast.  Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst them.  He carries an armful of videos.                  RANDY         I thought we d make it a BLOCKBUSTER         night.  He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and Tatum dive in.                  STU         I thought everything was checked out.                  RANDY         I had  em hid in the foreign section.  Sidney peruses the videos.                  SIDNEY         THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT         --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these         movies?                  RANDY         She s the Scream Queen.                  STU         With that set of lungs--she should be.                  TATUM             (to Sid)         Tits--see.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER  The party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit, lean.  Some crowd around the floor in front of the television. Randy is taking a vote.                  RANDY         How many EVIL DEAD S?             (hands go up)         How many HELLRAISER S?  Hands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc.  The doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it.                  STU         I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They re         in the fridge in the garage.                  TATUM         What am I? The beer wench?                  STU             (o.c.)         Hey, guess who s here? It s that chick         from INSIDE STORY?  They look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the foyer.                  TATUM         Shit, Dewey!  Everyone perks up, eyeing Gale.                  TATUM         What is she doing here?                  DEWEY         She s with me. I just wanted to check on         things.  The GUYS in the room are drooling over Gale.  Including Stu.                  TATUM         So you did--now leave...and take your         media muff with you.  Tatum takes off for the kitchen.  Gale has quickly become the focus of the party.  All eyes are on her.                  SOME TEEN         I watch your show regularly.                  STU         This must be big news to be on INSIDE         STORY.                  GALE         Huge.                  ANOTHER TEEN         Wanna interview us?                  RANDY         We could be like two grief stricken         students and we ll say really nice things         about our good friends who were         slaughtered senselessly.                  STU         I can cry on cue.  Gale eyes the bookshelf above the television.                  GALE         Maybe later?  Suddenly, Gale starts to COUGH.                  GALE         Can I trouble you for some water?                  STU         How  bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a         beer.                  RANDY         You get it.  Gale slips the camera from her bag--hits the ON switch and holds it behind her...waiting for the right moment.  BACK IN FOYER                  SIDNEY         Have they found my father?                  DEWEY         Afraid not.                  SIDNEY         Should I be worried?                  DEWEY         Not yet.  INT.  KITCHEN  Tatum is alone in the kitchen.  She empties popcorn into a bowl, then pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then remembers...  She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the...  INT.  GARAGE  The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage. Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch.  She finds a button and hits it.  BRRRRMMM!  The electric garage door starts to rise.  Wrong switch.  She hits it again and it closes.  She finds another switch.  CLICK.  A small lightbulb overhead comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows along the wall.  Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it, not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her, sealing her off from the rest of the house.  Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.  Its light casts a glow across her face.  CRASH-BOOM!  Tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a large pet door that s built into the garage door.  She smiles at her jumpiness.  Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back to the kitchen.  At the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob. It s locked.                  TATUM         SHIT!  She KICKS it with her foot several times.                  TATUM         Hey, Shitheads!  A moment.  No answer.                  TATUM         OH, SHIT PISS!  Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button. BRRRMM!  It begins to rise.  She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR- BRRRM!  The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down, closing.                  TATUM         What the...  Tatum spins around to see..  A GHOST MASKED FIGURE  Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes.                  TATUM         Is that you, Randy? Cute.  The FIGURE stares at her, blankly.                  TATUM         And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON         YOUR GARAGE.  Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE.                  TATUM         Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she ll         flip.  The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side.                  TATUM         Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?  The FIGURE slowly nods.                  TATUM         Can I be the helpless victim?  The FIGURE slowly nods again.                  TATUM         Okay, let s see.  No, please don t kill         me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the         sequel.   Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too, blocking her.                  TATUM         Cut, Casper. That s a wrap.  Tatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he s faster and cuts her off.  Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside.                  TATUM         Randy--will you stop?  But as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist hard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing...                  TATUM         You little shit.  Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm...  Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious.  The FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator, SCREAMING.                  TATUM         Who are you?  The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping back against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she rips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face, sending him backwards, reeling.  Tatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS and PULLS on it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he s recovering...  She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as the...  FIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through.  EXT.  GARAGE DOOR  Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS wildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side...  A true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the FIGURE, knocking him away.  She takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she stops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can t move.  She listens but hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And then...  CRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise upward, taking Tatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY.                  TATUM         NOOOOOOOO.....  Tatum s arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up...  She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly.  INT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER  It s getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door, muttering,  parents and curfew , etc.  The door hangs open wide. Sid moves to close it when....  BILLY appears in a classic fake scare.                  SIDNEY         Billy? Jesus, you scared me.  Stu appears.                  STU             (with a wink)         Dude. What are you doing here?                  BILLY         I was hoping Sid and I could talk.                  SIDNEY         If Tatum sees you--she ll draw blood.                  STU         You guys can go up to my parents room?         To talk and...whatever.                  BILLY         Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.                  SIDNEY         It s okay. We need to talk.  Sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase.  Randy appears from the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear upstairs.                  RANDY         What s Leatherface doing here?                  STU         He came to make up.                  RANDY         There goes my chance with Sid.                  STU         Like you had one.  INT.  NEWSVAN  Kenny fidgets at the control board.  He hits a coupla buttons, bangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges...the living room.  The camera is positioned just above the television...  ON SCREEN  The party is in full swing.  Several TEENS sit right in front of the television.  Because of the camera s position they appear to be staring right into the lens.  Suddenly, the van s side door slides open and Gale pops in.                  KENNY         Got a picture. Perfect placement. We         can see everything.  Gale is ecstatic.                  GALE         Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid         journalist ever won the Pulitzer?  INT.  BEDROOM  A large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a balcony.  Sid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment.  Awkward.                  SIDNEY         So...                  BILLY         So...I m sorry. I ve been a selfish shit         and I m sorry.                  SIDNEY         No, Billy. I m the one who s been         selfish and self-absorbed with all of my         post traumatic stress.                  BILLY         You lost your mom...                  SIDNEY         But you re right--enough is enough. I         can t wallow in the grief process forever         and I can t keep lying to myself about         who my mom was.  Billy bows his head quietly, knowingly.                  SIDNEY         I think in some weird analytical,         psychological bullshit way I m scared         I m gonna turn out just like her, you         know? Like the bad seed or something...                  BILLY         Oh Sidney...                  SIDNEY         Everytime I get close to you I see my         mom. I know it doesn t make sense.                  BILLY         Sure it does. It s like Jodie Foster in         SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she         kept having flashbacks of her dead father.                  SIDNEY         But this is life. This isn t a movie.                  BILLY         Sure it is, Sid. It s all a movie. Life s         one great big movie. Only you can t         pick your genre.  Billy moves to her.  They embrace, tenderly.                  SIDNEY         I wanna let go. I do...                  BILLY         Ssshh...everything s gonna be okay. I         promise.  Sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long and hard.  She breaks away passionately, out of breath.                  SIDNEY         Why can t I be a Meg Ryan movie?  Billy nibbles her neck.                  BILLY         Sshh..it s okay.                  SIDNEY         Or even a good porno.                  BILLY             (shocked)         What?  She stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.                  SIDNEY         You heard me.                  BILLY             (incredulous)         Are you serious?                  SIDNEY             (surprising herself)         Yeah...I think so.  They smile at each other.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER  The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks, completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards.                  TEEN #1         Look, here it comes. SPLAT!                  TEEN #2         The blood s not the right color. Why do         they do that? It s too red.                  RANDY         Here comes another...                  TEEN #3         Predictable. Knew he was going to bite         it.                  BORED TEEN         How can you watch this shit over and         over?                  RANDY         Shhhhh.                  STU         I wanna see Jamie Lee s breasts. When do         we see Jamie Lee s breasts?                  RANDY         Not until TRADING PLACES in  83. Jamie         Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.         She didn t show her tits until she went legit.                  BOY TEEN         No way.                  RANDY         That s why she always lived. Only         virgins can outsmart the killer in the         big chase scene in the end. Don t you         know the rules?  Stu finishes his beer.                  STU         What rules?  Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television, explaining.                  RANDY         There are certain rules that one must         abide by in order to successfully survive         a horror movie. For instance: 1. You         can never have sex. The minute you get a         little nookie--you re as good as gone.         Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink         or do drugs. The sin factor. It s an         extension of number one. And 3. Never,         ever, ever, under any circumstances, say          I ll be right back.                   STU         Wanna another beer?                  RANDY         Yeah.                  STU         I ll be right back.  Everybody  ooohhs .                  RANDY         There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave         bye-bye.  INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS  Gale and Kenny watch the monitor.  The party is clearing out some  A RAP at the van door.  Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley standing, his face all smiles.                  DEWEY         Sheriff just radioed me. I m gonna check         out a possible lead. Thought you might         like to join me.                  GALE         What kind of lead?                  DEWEY         A car was spotted in the bushes a little         ways up the road.                  GALE         I d love to. If you re sure it s         alright?                  DEWEY         Ma am, I am the Deputy of this town.                  GALE         Can I bring Kenny?                  DEWEY             (too quickly)         NO! I mean...I should probably take just         you.  Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny.                  GALE         I ll be back.  She slides the van door closed.  EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS  Gale heads for Dewey s patrol jeep.                  DEWEY         Actually, I thought we could walk. It s         not far.  Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.  She s genuinely smitten by this young guy.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS  SCARY MUSIC fills the room.  The party is reduced to the diehards in front of the television.                  RANDY             (pointing to TV)         Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot.                  OTHER GUYS         Beautiful! Finally!  INT.  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS  Billy and Sidney are going at it...passionately.  He has his head buried in her neck.                  SIDNEY             (to herself)          Eight is enough to fill our lives with         love...   It s working.  Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt over her head.  She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the...  CAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.  Just as Sid s bra straps slide of her shoulders...  Billy moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off, Blocking Sidney from view.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER  Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone RINGS.  Everyone ignores it.  It RINGS again.  Finally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table.                  RANDY         Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.  Randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the TV remote and pauses the movie, the others protest  Hey, Put is back...  etc.                  RANDY         Listen up. They found Principal Himbry         dead. He was gutted and hung from the         goal post on the football field.  This stills the room.  Complete silence as the news sinks in.  ON different faces...a moment of devastation..disbelief.  And then:                  TEEN #1         So what are we waiting for?                  TEEN #2         Let s get over there before they pry him         down.  And in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the door..HOOTIN  and HOLLERIN  ...leaving Randy, near drunk, alone in the living room.  He returns to the movie.                  RANDY         We were just getting to the good part.  INT.  NEWSVAN - MINUTES LATER  Kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time ago.  He finds a bag of Cheetos and chows down when he hears SCREAMING from outside.  He peers out the window to see the last of the PARTY KIDS pile into two cars and race off down the road.  He chews a Cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.  INT.  BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER  The sex is over...and both Sid and Billy are dressing respectively.  That post-sex awkwardness.  Sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone on the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses her face.  She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on his shoes.                  SIDNEY         Who did you call?                  BILLY         What?                  SIDNEY         When you re arrested-you re allowed one         phone call? Who did you call?                  BILLY         I called my dad.                  SIDNEY         No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw         him.                  BILLY         Yeah...and when I called no one answered.                  SIDNEY         Uh-huh.                  BILLY         You don t still think it was me?                  SIDNEY         No, but if it were you, that would have         been a very clever way to throw me off         track. Using your one phone call to call         me so I wouldn t think it was you.  Billy stands up.                  BILLY         What do I have to do to prove to you I m         not a killer?  He makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant, from the open balcony doors comes...  THE GHOST FIGURE  Sidney sees the FIGURE immedietely, SCREAMING.  Billy tries to calm her, oblivious to the advancing GHOST.                  SIDNEY         BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!  Billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air. It strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the air.  ON SIDNEY as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife is thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a fight..but it s useless...he never had a chance.  His body falls to the floor..lifeless.  ANGLE ON GHOST  as he watches Billy s body come to a still before quietly, calmly turning his attention to...  SIDNEY who stands, numb...scared to death.  And only when the GHOST takes a step forward does Sidney break.  She takes off like a rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.  INT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS  Sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy s blood.  ANGLE ON THE GHOST  as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar.  She pulls away from him...her shirt ripping down the back.  Her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door open...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.  INT.  DARK SPACE - CONTINUOUS  Total darkness.  Sidney s hands scour the wall for a light switch. The doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly SHAKEN from it s hinges...and then...  NOTHING.  All goes silent.  Only Sidney s rapid BREATHING fills the space around her.  Sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she finds a string.  She pulls it...as a lightbulb SWITCHES on overhead.  She s in a small box of a room.  The door is on one side, a small, narrow staircase on the other.  She eyes the doorknob, then the staircase...contemplating...but it s an easy decision.  There s no fucking way she s going up to the attic.  She unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won t give...she pushes on it again.  It s locked from the other side.  Shit.  She turns to the staircase.  EXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS  A long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale and Dewey can be heard.                  GALE         So is Dewey your real name?                  DEWEY         Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck         with a long time ago.                  GALE         I like it. It s... sexy.                  DEWEY         Nah... it s just this town s way of not         taking me serious.                  GALE         What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a         meteorologist...  CLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side- flirtatiously.  Gale is surprisingly nervous.                  GALE         People treat me like the Antichrist of         television journalism.                  DEWEY         I don t think you re so bad.  Gale smiles.                  GALE         Are all the local boys as sweet as you?  Dewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear behind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come racing right at them.  Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars speed by, oblivious to them.  IN THE DITCH  Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a glance in her eyes before rolling off her.                  DEWEY         You okay?  Something takes Gale s attention.                  GALE         What s that?  Dewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and aims it into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible.                  DEWEY         Looks like a car.  Dewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight on the plates but it s already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the same car we last saw Sidney s father driving away in.                  DEWEY         Shit. It s Neil Prescott s car.                  GALE         Sidney s father?                  DEWEY         We gotta get back. Jesus. He s here.         What the fuck is he doing here?  Dewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS  Randy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely involved in the movie on the screen.  SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.                  RANDY             (to TV)         No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!         Behind you!  And if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised.  INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS  Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches his eye.  ON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the movie.  Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double- take.  No fucking way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still, unmoving, knife raised.                  KENNY         JESUS...FUCK...  The GHOST takes a silent step forward.                  KENNY             (screaming at the monitor)         BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!  This kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the side door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as...  A LONG, SHARP BLADE  comes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon him.  THE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR  just in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy, leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a thirty second walk to the newsvan.  INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS  The attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes, and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front wall of the house.  Sidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection. She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy s blood.  She stares long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She moves on, determined.  She eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could only reach it...  EXT.  FRONT YARD  Gale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic.                  DEWEY         I ll call for backup.                  GALE         I ll get my camera.  They split up.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS GALE as she rushes to the newsvan, throwing open the door.                  GALE         Kenny! Camera! Quick!  The van is empty.                  GALE         Kenny?  A CAR HORN goes off.  Gale spins around.  It came from the patrol jeep in the driveway.                  GALE             (calling out)         Dewey?  She moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open...Dewey is nowhere to be found.                  GALE         Dewey? Where are you?  A look of pure dread comes over Gale.  INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS  Sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the window.  She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame.  She spots Gale almost immedietely.  She SCREAMS OUT, looking for the window latch.  But there s not one.  It doesn t open.  Sidney starts beating on it...trying to break it...  EXT.  FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS  Gale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear Sidney s SCREAMS three floors up.  Gale reaches for the door just as she hears LOUD, HORRIBLE SHRIEKS from just inside.  She backs away.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS  AN EAR-CURDLING JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAM BLASTS through the empty living room as the horror movie on TV comes to it s horrifying climax.  Randy is now gone.  EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS  Gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the house.  She moves back to the van...  INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS  Sidney has found an old tennis racket.  She swings a solid forehand at the window.  THE WINDOW SPRAYS GLASS  Sidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and pulling herself through the window frame.  EXT.  SIDE OF THE HOUSE  Sidney wastes no time.  She looks for Gale, SCREAMING, but Gale is gone.  Sid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion of the roof onto...  THE MASTER S BEDROOM BALCONY.  Then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself, letting herself hang as low as she can...then she lets go, free- falling the rest of the way...but in a split instant...  THE GHOST APPEARS  grabbing her wrists in midair.  Her body hangs, dangling against the side of the house.  The GHOST begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.  Sidney jerks, pulls, twists...but the HANDS have her, hoisting her up...Sidney SCREAMS MADLY...yanking one last time, freeing herself.  SHE DROPS TO THE GROUND, a good seven feet, landing on her back, hitting hard.  She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself upright.  INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS  Gale is frantic.  She starts the engine up and hits the headlights when she discovers she can t see out of the windshield.  Gale rubs at the glass.  Sure enough, something is on the windshield outside, blocking her sight.  Gale hits the wipers as BLOOD SMEARS across the glass, it drips down from above.  Gale SCREAMS as a HAND reaches in through the open window...she looks up to see...  RANDY, staring at her madly.                  RANDY         What s going on?  A sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car forward, into a ditch.  She hits the BRAKES.  Randy is thrown forward, away from the van.  Gale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again...just as Kenny s face comes sliding down the outside of the windshield...eyes wide, face distorted, blood everywhere.  Gale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny s corpse flying off the top of the van.  Gale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly, gaining speed just as...  SIDNEY APPEARS  in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling a young Sissy Spacek.  Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van veers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side, sliding off into the thick foliage.  EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS  Sidney races to where the van lay on it s side.  Sidney peers through the windshield...Gale s body lay limp and bloody.  SIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the patrol jeep with it s open door...she goes for it.  INT.  JEEP  Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just then, Sidney s eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the front door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness, undetectable.  Sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the house, revealing...  DEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.                  SIDNEY         DEWEY!  Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body, slumped, knees buckled...  And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the porch hard.  Standing behind him is...  THE GHOST  SIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL.                  SIDNEY         NOOOOOOOO!!!!!  Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She reaches over and locks the passenger s door and then she...waits.  And watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey s still body, fumbling with something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he holds...  THE KEYS  They jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying this...  Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it impossible to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the glass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE.  She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view.  Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over her own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED.  Then she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers side door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down.  A shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The lock turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it down, securing it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is certifiable.  Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the mouthpiece and hits the switch.                  SIDNEY         Help! Please! I m at Stu Maker s house         on Turner Lane. Please, HE S GONNA         KILL ME!  EXT.  FRONT OF JEEP  ANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police band.  She doesn t see the...  GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in behind her.  The GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney s neck.  Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the GHOST.  She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.  Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she pulls...  The door swings open...  Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground.  EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS  Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see nothing...  THE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED.  Sidney s eyes roam the yard but he s nowhere.  Completely gone. Vanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where...  DEWEY S BODY LAY  Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey s holster and grabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO S behind her...                  VOICE             (o.c.)         Sidney!  She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone cold sober.                  RANDY         Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.  Sidney throws the gun forward.                  SIDNEY         Stop. Right there.                  RANDY         Don t shoot. It s me.                  SIDNEY         Don t come any closer.                  RANDY         Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She s         dead, she s been killed...I think Stu did         it.  He takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP.                  VOICE             (o.c.)         Don t believe him, Sid.  Sidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk.                  STU         He s lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.  Stu moves closer to Sidney.                  SIDNEY         Stay away.  She aims the gun in his direction.                  STU         His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.         He s gone psycho.                  RANDY         Don t listen to him. It s him. He s the         one.  Sidney has lost it, she doesn t know who to trust.  She aims the gun at Stu..then Randy..then Stu...                  STU         Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.                  RANDY         No, Sid.  They both move toward her.  There s no time.  She must act now. Finally...                  SIDNEY         Fuck you both.  And with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the front door shut.  INT.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER  Sid locks and bolts the door.  From the other side she can hear Randy SCREAMING.                  RANDY         NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...         HE S GONE CRAZY.  His fists POUND against the door.  Sidney, stumbling in the darkness, rushes to the phone in the living room.  Just as she reaches for it...it RINGS.  It scares the life out of her.  She SCREAMS, yanking it up.                  SIDNEY         Please! God! Help me!                  VOICE             (from the phone)         Having fun Sidney?  Sidney falls apart, SCREAMING.                  SIDNEY         NOOOOOOOOO!!!  She throws the phone down, disconnecting the call.  Sid moves back to the door.  RANDY S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.  She eyes the lock, deliberating.                  SIDNEY             (at the door)         GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!  CLUNK!  A NOISE UPSTAIRS.  Sidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED to see...  BILLY  emerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.  Very much alive.                  SIDNEY         Oh God. Billy!  He s blood-soaked and dazed.  Sidney meets him in the landing, grabbing him, holding him...                  SIDNEY         I thought you were...                  BILLY         I m alright. Gotta...get...help.  Billy goes for the door.                  SIDNEY         He s out there.  Randy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS.                  RANDY             (through door)         Please, you gotta let me in. He s         gonna kill me.  Billy goes for the door.  Sidney blocks him.                  SIDNEY         NO! Don t believe him.                  BILLY         It s okay. Give me the gun.  Sidney hands him the gun.  Billy turns and unlocks the door, opening it.  Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading...                  RANDY         Help me...                  BILLY             (calming him)         Shhhh. It s okay.                  RANDY         Stu s flipped out. He s gone mad.  Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy s face.                  BILLY          We all go a little mad sometimes.   Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls the trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy s body against the wall before sliding to a heap on the floor...still.                  BILLY         Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO  BILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY...  Who stands only feet away, face aghast...  Fuck, no...this can t be happening.  Billy s eyes are on her, unmoving.  He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his face...tasting it.                  BILLY         Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for         pig s blood in CARRIE.  Sidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the dark refines of the kitchen.  Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes another step back--petrified.  CLOSE ON BILLY S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There is something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is pure evil.  She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.  THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline of a FIGURE appears...  STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY.  She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...  STU  Sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.                  SIDNEY         Stu...please...help me...  Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face.                  STU             (whispering into phone)         Surprise, Sidney.  His VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer.  Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It becomes all too clear.  She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...  SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM  If for no other reason than to put space between her and them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in.                  BILLY         Where ya going? It s not over yet. We ve         got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it s         your turn.                  STU         Oh yeah  Stu disappears into the kitchen.                  BILLY             (to Sidney)         What s wrong? You look like you ve seen         a ghost.  Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve.  A NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu reappears from the front hall...wrestling with something...someone...  CLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it rolls into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find...  HER FATHER  bound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.                  SIDNEY         Daddy!  She starts for him.                  BILLY         Close enough.  Stu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott s shirt pocket.                  STU         Guess, I won t be needing this anymore.                  SIDNEY         Why are you doing this?                  STU         It s all part of the game.                  BILLY         It s called GUESS HOW I M GOING TO DIE!                  SIDNEY         Fuck you.                  BILLY         We already played that game. You lost,         remember?                  STU         You have to play, Sid. Don t want to         disappoint your dad. He s been waiting         around all night.                  BILLY         It s an easy game. We ask you a         question. If you get it wrong--you die.                  STU         And if you get it right--you die.                  SIDNEY         You re crazy--both of you.                  STU         The official term is  psychotic .                  SIDNEY         You ll never get away with this.                  BILLY         Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn t         believe how easy it was to frame him.                  STU         Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took         a few notes. It was fun.  Billy and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves.  Sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes.  She looks back to Billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.                  SIDNEY         Why did you kill my mother?                  BILLY         Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I         think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don t         really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did         Norman Bates have a motive?  Stu plays along, shaking his head.                  STU         Nope.                  BILLY         And did they really ever explain why         Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?         Don t think so. You see, it s scarier         when there s no motive, Sid.                  SIDNEY             (fighting tears)         I don t understand...                  BILLY         We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman         was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit         all over town like she was Sharon Stone or         something.                  STU             (laughing)         ..so we put her out of her misery. I         mean, let s face it, your mom was no         Sharon Stone.  Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious.                  BILLY         Is that motive enough for you? Or how         about this? Did you know your slut         mother was sleeping with my dad and she s         the reason my mom moved out and deserted         me.  A sudden silence.  Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant with truth.                  SIDNEY         What?  Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness.                  BILLY         Think about it. On the off chance I get         caught-a motive like that could divide a         jury for years, don t you think?. You took         my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy         factor. Maternal abandonment causes         serious deviant behavior. It certainly         fucked you up. It made you have sex with         a psychopath.                  STU         That s right and now that you re no         longer a virgin. You gotta die--those         are the rules.  Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer.  And then moves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand.                  BILLY         Pretend this is all just a scary movie,         Sid. How do you think it s going to end?  Sidney doesn t respond.                  STU             (excited)         This is the best part, Sid. Billy s got         it all figured out. Why do you think we         kept your father alive so long? Why did         we save you for last?                  BILLY         You know what time it is, Sid? It s         after midnight. It s your mother s         anniversary. We killed her exactly one         year ago today.  Billy turns to Stu with the knife.  They eye each other.                  BILLY         Ready?                  STU         Yeah...  Billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing into Stu.  He stumbles to ho his knees, WINCING in pain.                  STU         Jesus...  Sidney SCREAMS...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red. Stu inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...                  STU         Good one. My turn.  He takes the knife from Billy.                  BILLY         Don t forget-stay to the side and don t         go too deep.  Stu stabs at Billy s belly, puncturing him...Billy doubles over...                  BILLY         Jesus...fuck, that hurt.                  SIDNEY         Stop it!                  BILLY             (squelching the pain)         Got the ending figured out yet? Time s         running out.                  STU         Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your         father is the chief suspect. We cloned         his cellular. The evidence is there.  Billy takes the knife and slashes at Stu s arm, two quick cuts...he doubles over...                  BILLY         What if your father snapped? Your mom s         anniversary set him off and he went on a         murder spree, killing everyone...                  STU             (in major pain)         Except for me and Billy...we were left         for dead...                  BILLY         And then he killed you and then shoots         himself in the head. It s a perfect         ending.                  STU         Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on         and plan the sequel. Let s face it, these         days--you gotta have a sequel.  Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy.                  SIDNEY         You sick fucks--you ve seen one too many         movies.  Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed.                  BILLY         Oh Sid, don t blame the movies...Movies         don t create psychos. Movies just make         psychos more creative.  Stu staggers a bit.                  STU         That s it, Billy. I can t take any more.         I m feeling woozy.                  BILLY         Get the gun. I ll untie Pops.  Billy moves to Sidney s father.                  STU         Where d you put it?  Stu is searching the foyer for the gun.                  BILLY         It s on the table.                  STU         No, it s not.  Billy hobbles over.  The gun is gone.                  BILLY         Where the fuck is it?                  VOICE             (off camera)         Right here, asshole.  Billy and Stu look up in unison to see...  GALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY  standing in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered and bloody.  Her hair a mess.                  BILLY         I thought she was dead.                  STU         She looked dead. Still does.  Gale holds the gun firm, in total control.                  GALE         I ve got an ending for you. The reporter         left for dead in the newsvan comes to,         stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the         gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.  Sidney steps forward.                  SIDNEY         I like that ending.  Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye each other.                  BILLY         She can t get both of us.                  STU         Odds are--she ll miss anyway.  In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on.  Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING IT SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the door.  She goes down...out.                  STU         Cool move.  Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where Gale lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find...  SIDNEY GONE.                  BILLY         Where d she go?  Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has completely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains in the living.                  STU         I don t know Billy but I m hurtin .                  BILLY         Where the fuck did she go?  Suddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other. Completely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone.                  BILLY             (picking up phone)         Hello?                  SIDNEY             (from phone)         Are you alone in the house?  Billy looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone.                  BILLY         You bitch--where the fuck are you?                  SIDNEY         Not so fast.  We re gonna play a little         game. It s called GUESS WHO JUST         CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED         YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?  Billy looks around the living room.                  BILLY         Find her.  Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose it.  He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.                  BILLY         FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!                  STU         I can t...I m bad off, Billy. You cut         to deep.  Billy throws the phone at Stu.  He mouths to him, so Sid can t hear.   Talk to her...   Then Billy takes off for the kitchen. Stu takes the phone.                  SIDNEY             (aware)         So Stu, what s your motive? Billy s got         one. The police are on their way. What         are you going to tell them?                  STU         Peer pressure...I m way to sensitive.  Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu.  He s completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.                  BILLY             (SCREAMING in phone)         I m gonna rip you up bitch. Just like         your slut whore mother.                  SIDNEY         Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed         Mama s boy.  Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet.  Touche!  He smiles deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as...  A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.  Billy stumbles back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down.  Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.  She looks at Billy, disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy s now still body.  A movement behind her sends her reeling around to find...  RANDY slowly sitting up.  His body drenched in blood.  He s alive...barely.  He looks to Sidney...through pain...                  RANDY         You know what I hate most about horror         movies? The final scene...it just goes on         and on...and it gets so stupid...  Randy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him, completely unexpected...it s Stu...barreling into him...they fall back into the living room.  Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and turns to the living room to find...  Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...  HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney s ankle, toppling her to the floor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...  IN THE LIVING ROOM  Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing...  ON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she s got...  Randy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu...he grabs hold of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out of Stu s clutch...  His hands find the top of the TV...the VCR...he yanks on it, gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force-CRASHING the VCR into Stu s head.  Stu drops.  ON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billy s open chest wound.  He CRIES OUT BLOODY MURDER.  Her other hand brings the gun up to his face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash of silver appears above Sidney.  Billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above Sidney ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER striking Billy knocking him back into the living room.  Sidney looks up to see...  GALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the gun s chamber.  Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.  Their eyes meet.  A life truce.  INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS  Billy and Stu lay face up, head to head.  Sid and Gale move over them, staring down.  Randy joins them.                  RANDY         Sid, you found me out...I m a virgin.         And pretty happy about it right now.  Sidney nudges their bodies.  They both stir.                  RANDY         Careful. This is the moment when you         think the killer s dead, but then he         springs back to life for one last scare.  Sidney grabs the gun from Gale.                  SIDNEY         Not this time.  She positions her foot on Stu s chest and aims.                  SIDNEY         This is for my Mom, asshole.  She SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot.  The she aims the barrel at Billy who s eyes suddenly open, blinking up at her, blood bubbling from his lips.  He s not yet dead.  Their eyes lock.                  SIDNEY         And this Billy stud-bucket is for having         an incredibly small weenie.  She FIRES another perfect shot.  They re both goners.  Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies.  A quiet moment when suddenly...  A FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM  Both Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic, final scare proportions as Mr. Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged.  Sid catches her breath, relaxing.                  SIDNEY         Oh Daddy...  She rushes to him, untying him...while Gale moves to the bookcase and retrieves the hidden camera.                  GALE         I wanna close-up.  Randy appears by Sidney s side, helping her untie her father.                  RANDY         This is probably an inappropriate         moment, but you think you d want         to maybe go out with me sometime...         like on a date?  Sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.                  RANDY         Maybe catch a movie?  A long moment as Sidney s face goes from disbelief to resignation to the slight trace of a smile.                  SIDNEY         Only if it s a nice Meg Ryan movie.                  RANDY         You got it.  He smiles at her...watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father, holding him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one hell of an ending to this SCARY MOVIE.

OPEN ROADS - NIGHT - TITLE SEQUENCE                 A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking                 individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey                 on horseback. He looks anxious.                 EXT. NORLAND PARK - ENGLAND - MARCH 1800 - NIGHT                 Silence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the                 early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit                 parkland.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - MR DASHWOOD S BEDROOM - NIGHT                 In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN                 (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured.                 Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing                 susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS                 DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes                 never leaving his face.                                       MR DASHWOOD                               (urgent)                          Is John not yet arrived?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          We expect him at any moment, dearest.                 MR DASHWOOD looks anguished.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          The girls--I have left so little.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Shh, hush, Henry.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          Elinor will try to look after you                           all, but make sure she finds a good                           husband. The men are such noodles                           hereabouts, little wonder none has                           pleased her.                 They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to                 conceal her fear and grief                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          But Marianne is sure to find her                           storybook hero.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          A romantic poet with flashing eyes                           and empty pockets?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          As long as she loves him, whoever he                           is.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          Margaret will go to sea and become a                           pirate so we need not concern                           ourselves with her.                 MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older                 MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every                 feature.                                       THOMAS                          Your son is arrived from London,                           sir.                 MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife s hand.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          Let me speak to John alone.                 She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite                 tenderness.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          Ah, my dear. How happy you have made                           me.                 MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She                 allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as                 he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes                 her place by the bed.                                       JOHN                          Father...                 MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to                 whisper with desperate intensity.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          John you will find out soon enough                           from my will that the estate of                           Norland was left to me in such a way                           as prevents me from dividing it                           between my families.                 JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.                                       JOHN                          Calm yourself, Father. This is not                           good for you.                 But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          Norland in its entirety is therefore                           yours by law and I am happy for you                           and Fanny.                 JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected                 delight.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          But your stepmother my wife and                           daughters are left with only five                           hundred pounds a year, barely enough                           to live on and nothing for the girls                            dowries. You must help them.                 JOHN s face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind                 them is the ominous rustling of parchments.                                       JOHN                          Of course                                       MR DASHWOOD                          You must promise to do this.                 A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN s natural                 hypocrisy.                                       JOHN                          I promise, Father, I promise.                 MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes.                 JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find                 the DOCTOR.                                       JOHN                          Come! Come quickly!                 But it is we who share the dying man s last words.                                       MR DASHWOOD                          Help them.                 EXT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY                 Outside the house sits a very well-to-do carriage. Behind it                 waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying                 trunks and boxes.                                       FANNY (V.O.)                           Help them?                  INT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY                 JOHN is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape.                 He is watching, and obviously waiting for, a pert WOMAN (FANNY                 DASHWOOD) who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly.                                       FANNY                          What do you mean,  help them ?                                       JOHN                          Dearest, I mean to give them three                           thousand pounds.                 FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.                                       JOHN                          The interest will provide them with                           a little extra income. Such a gift                           will certainly discharge my promise                           to my father.                 FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror.                                       FANNY                          Oh, without question! More than                           amply...                                       JOHN                          One had rather, on such occasions,                           do too much than too little.                 A pause as FANNY turns and looks at him again.                                       JOHN                          Of course, he did not stipulate a                           particular sum.                 INT. LAUNDRY - NORLAND PARK - DAY                 A red-eyed MAID (BETSY) plunges a beautiful muslin frock                 into a vat of black dye.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD S BEDROOM - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD is rushing about, mourning ribbons flapping,                 putting her knick-knacks into a small valise. The room is in                 chaos. A young WOMAN (ELINOR DASHWOOD) looks on helplessly.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          To be reduced to the condition of                           visitor in my own home! It is not to                           be borne, Elinor!                                       ELINOR                          Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to                           go.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          John and Fanny will descend from                           London at any moment, followed no                           doubt by cartloads of relatives ready                           to turn us out of our rooms one by                           one do you expect me to be here to                           welcome them? Vultures!                 She suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.                                       ELINOR                          I shall start making inquiries for a                           new house at once. Until then we                           must try to bear their coming.                 INT. JOHN AND FANNY S CARRIAGE - DAY                 JOHN and FANNY are on their way out of London.                                       JOHN                          Fifteen hundred then. What say you                           to fifteen hundred?                                       FANNY                          What brother on earth would do half                           so much for his real sisters--let                           alone half-blood?                                       JOHN                          They can hardly expect more.                                       FANNY                          There is no knowing what they expect.                           The question is, what can you afford?                 INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 A beautiful young WOMAN (MARIANNE DASHWOOD) is sitting at                 the piano playing a particularly sad piece. ELINOR enters.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, cannot you play something                           else? Mamma has been weeping since                           breakfast.                 MARIANNE stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts                 playing something equally lugubrious.                                       ELINOR                          I meant something less mournful,                           dearest.                 EXT. ROADSIDE INN - DAY                 JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the final                 adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting                 for a tip.                                       JOHN                          A hundred pounds a year to their                           mother while she lives. Would that                           be more advisable? It is better than                           parting with the fifteen hundred all                           at once.                 He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and                 nods.                                       FANNY                          But if she should live longer than                           fifteen years we would be completely                           taken in. People always live forever                           when there is an annuity to be paid                           them.                 JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD.                 EXT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET S TREE-HOUSE - DAY                 ELINOR comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small                 staircase issues.                                       ELINOR                          Margaret, are you there? Please come                           down. John and Fanny will be here                           soon.                 A pause. ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied and                 truculent young voice stops her.                                       MARGARET (V.O.)                          Why are they coming to live at                           Norland? They already have a house                           in London.                                       ELINOR                          Because houses go from father to                           son, dearest not from father to                           daughter. It is the law.                 Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.                                       ELINOR                          If you come inside, we could play                           with your atlas.                                       MARGARET (V.O.)                          It s not my atlas any more. It s                           their atlas.                 CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement.                 INT. JOHN AND FANNY S CARRIAGE - DAY                 JOHN and FANNY joggle on.                                       JOHN                          Twenty pounds now and then will amply                           discharge my promise, you are quite                           right.                                       FANNY                          Indeed. Although to say the truth, I                           am convinced within myself that your                           father had no idea of your giving                           them money.                                       JOHN                          They will have five hundred a year                           amongst them as it is--                                       FANNY                          --and what on earth can four women                           want for more than that? Their                           housekeeping will be nothing at all                           they will have no carriage, no horses,                           hardly any servants and will keep no                           company. Only conceive how comfortable                           they will be!                 INT. NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS  HALL - DAY                 The large contingent of SERVANTS who staff Norland Park are                 gathered in gloomy silence as ELINOR addresses them.                                       ELINOR                          As you know, we are looking for a                           new home. When we leave we shall be                           able to retain only Thomas and Betsy.                 CAM holds on THOMAS and BETSY, a capable woman.                                       ELINOR                          We are very sorry to have to leave                           you all. But we are certain you will                           find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and                           generous mistress.                 EXT. NORLAND PARK. DRIVE - DAY                 JOHN and FANNY s carriage approaches Norland.                                       FANNY (V.O.)                          They will be much more able to give                           you something.                 INT. JOHN AND FANNY S CARRIAGE - DAY                 JOHN and FANNY are about to get out.                                       JOHN                          So we are agreed. No money but the                           occasional gift of game and fish in                           season will be very welcome.                                       FANNY                          Your father would be proud of you.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVE                 The entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present.                 BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence.                 Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with                 resentment. MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity.                 ELINOR tries to play hostess.                                       ELINOR                          How is Mrs Ferrars?                                       FANNY                          My mother is always in excellent                           health, thank you. My brother Robert                           is in town with her this season and                           quite the most popular bachelor in                           London! He has his own barouche.                 In the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously                 checks the hallmark on her butterknife.                                       ELINOR                          You have two brothers, have you not?                                       FANNY                          Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest                           Mamma quite depends upon him. He is                           traveling up from Plymouth shortly                           and will break his journey here.                 MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly. JOHN notices.                                       JOHN                               (to MRS DASHWOOD)                          If that is agreeable to you, of                           course.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          My dear John this is your home now.                 FANNY looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR S BEDROOM - DAY                 ELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels. She puts a                 shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as MARIANNE                 thunders in, looking mutinous.                                       MARIANNE                          Fanny wishes to know where the key                           for the silver cabinet is kept.                                       ELINOR                          Betsy has it, I think. What does                           Fanny want with the silver?                                       MARIANNE                          I can only presume she wants to count                           it. What are you doing?                                       ELINOR                          Presents for the servants. Have you                           seen Margaret? I am worried about                           her. She has taken to hiding in the                           oddest places.                                       MARIANNE                          Fortunate girl. At least she can                           escape Fanny, which is more than any                           of us is able.                                       ELINOR                          You do your best. You have not said                           a word to her for a week.                                       MARIANNE                               (truculently)                          I have! I have said  yes  and  no .                 INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY                 FANNY, MRS DASHWOOD, ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast.                 MARIANNE enters. ELINOR catches her eye and indicates FANNY                 with a slight motion of her head. MARIANNE makes a face.                                       MARIANNE                               (very polite)                          Good morning, Fanny.                 FANNY is rather startled.                                       FANNY                          Good morning, Marianne.                 ELINOR is relieved.                                       MARIANNE                               (to Fanny)                          How did you find the silver? Is it                           all genuine?                 ELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further.                                       ELINOR                          Pray, when may we expect the pleasure                           of your brother s company?                                       FANNY                          Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear                           Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact                           that he will not be with us for long,                           I wondered if Miss Margaret would                           mind giving up her room to him the                           view is quite incomparable from her                           windows and I should so much like                           Edward to see Norland at its best.                 MARIANNE slams her cup down and throws a furious look at                 ELINOR.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET S BEDROOM - DAY                 ELINOR and MARIANNE are removing MARGARET s toys.                                       MARIANNE                          Intolerable woman!                                       ELINOR                          There is but one consolation if Edward                           is anything like Fanny, we shall be                           only too happy to leave.                 EXT. NORLAND PARK - DRIVE - DAY                 A very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the gravel                 drive.                 CLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant façade.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 Everyone except MARGARET is present. EDWARD has just shaken                 bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the                 DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY s pro prietorial                 air.                                       FANNY                          But where is Miss Margaret? I declare,                           Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt                           of her existence! She must run                           positively wild!                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest                           is not to be found this morning. She                           is a little shy of strangers at                           present.                                       EDWARD                          Naturally. I am also shy of strangers                           and I have nothing like her excuse.                                       MARIANNE                               (dangerous)                          How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars?                 ELINOR glances at her warningly but EDWARD replies with                 careful consideration.                                       EDWARD                          Very much. Your stables are very                           handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs                           Dashwood.                                       FANNY                          Stables! Edward--your windows overlook                           the lake.                                       EDWARD                          An oversight, Fanny, led me to the                           wrong room. I have rectified the                           situation and am happily settled in                           the guest quarters.                 MARIANNE and ELINOR look at each other in surprise. FANNY                 looks furious.                 MRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD.                 CLOSE on ELINOR. She is impressed.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAY                 FANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with                 interest.                                       FANNY                          They are all exceedingly spoilt, I                           find. Miss Margaret spends all her                           time up trees and under furniture                           and I have barely had a civil word                           from Marianne.                                       EDWARD                          My dear Fanny, they have just lost                           their father their lives will never                           be the same again.                                       FANNY                          That is no excuse.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY                 FANNY leads EDWARD in. She sniffs with distaste.                                       FANNY                          I have never liked the smell of books.                                       EDWARD                          Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.                 As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating                 apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is                 obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He                 registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield                 it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to                 divert her.                                       EDWARD                          I hear you have great plans for the                           walnut grove.                                       FANNY                          Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down                           to make room for a Grecian temple.                 There is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD                 covers with a cough.                                       EDWARD                          How picturesque. Will you show me                           the site?                 And he ushers FANNY out, flicking a quick glance over his                 shoulder at the fugitive s foot.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAY                 ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a table                 with a pile of letters. ELINOR is handing one back to her                 mother.                                       ELINOR                          Too expensive. We do not need four                           bedrooms, we can share.                                       MARIANNE                          This one, then?                 ELINOR reads the letter quickly.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, we have only five hundred                           pounds a year. I will send out more                           inquiries today.                 There is a knock on the door. Hesitantly, EDWARD appears.                                       EDWARD                          Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I                           have found what you are looking for.                 MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner                 but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling                 relief.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAY                 EDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The                 door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax                 MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is                 giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings                 and she passes on unsuspecting.                                       ELINOR (V.O.)                          Won t you come out, dearest? We                           haven t seen you all day. Mamma is                           very concerned.                 More silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY                 EDWARD walks in loudly.                                       EDWARD                          Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was                           wondering do you by any chance have                           such a thing as a reliable atlas?                 ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment.                                       ELINOR                          I believe so.                                       EDWARD                          Excellent. I wish to check the                           position of the Nile.                 EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere.                                       EDWARD                          My sister says it is in South America.                 From under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in                 realisation.                                       ELINOR                          Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong.                           For I believe it is in--in Belgium.                                       EDWARD                          Belgium? Surely not. You must be                           thinking of the Volga.                                       MARGARET                               (from under the table)                          The Volga?                                       ELINOR                          Of course. The Volga, which, as you                           know, starts in...                                       EDWARD                          Vladivostok, and ends in...                                       ELINOR                          St Albans.                                       EDWARD                          Indeed. Where the coffee beans come                           from.                 They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity                 the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table                 of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of                 eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of                 EDWARD.                                       MARGARET                          The source of the Nile is in                           Abyssinia.                                       EDWARD                          Is it? Good heavens. How do you do.                           Edward Ferrars.                                       MARGARET                          Margaret Dashwood.                 EDWARD shakes MARGARET s hand solemnly and looks over her                 head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY                 JOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from                 FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR                 is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words                  of course we should like to leave as soon as possible .                 Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past                 the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds                 to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They                 feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of                 condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD                 suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR s gaze. She smiles                 but looks away quickly.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY                 EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening                 to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful,                 rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses                 EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away,                 embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees                 she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He                 comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes                 with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner:                 ECF.                                       ELINOR                               (apologetic)                          That was my father s favourite.                 EDWARD nods kindly.                                       ELINOR                          Thank you so much for your help with                           Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed                           girl since your arrival.                                       EDWARD                          Not at all. I enjoy her company.                                       ELINOR                          Has she shown you her tree-house?                                       EDWARD                          Not yet. Would you do me the honour,                           Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out.                                       ELINOR                          With pleasure.                 They start to walk out of shot, still talking.                                       ELINOR                          Margaret has always wanted to travel.                                       EDWARD                          I know. She is heading an expedition                           to China shortly. I am to go as her                           servant but only on the understanding                           that I will be very badly treated.                                       ELINOR                          What will your duties be?                                       EDWARD                          Sword-fighting, administering rum                           and swabbing.                                       ELINOR                          Ah.                 CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of                 the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further                 to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR                 with a face like a prune.                 EXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY                 EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm                 in the late afternoon sun.                                       EDWARD                          All I want--all I have ever wanted                           is the quiet of a private life but                           my mother is determined to see me                           distinguished.                                       ELINOR                          As?                                       EDWARD                          She hardly knows. Any fine figure                           will suit a great orator, a leading                           politician, even a barrister would                           serve, but only on the condition                           that I drive my own barouche and                           dine in the first circles.                 His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to                 it.                                       ELINOR                          And what do you wish for?                                       EDWARD                          I always preferred the church, but                           that is not smart enough for my mother                           she prefers the army, but that is a                           great deal too smart for me.                                       ELINOR                          Would you stay in London?                                       EDWARD                          I hate London. No peace. A country                           living is my ideal a small parish                           where I might do some good, keep                           chickens and give very short sermons.                 EXT. FIELDS NEAR NORLAND - DAY                 EDWARD and ELINOR are on horseback. The atmosphere is                 intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their                 affections.                                       ELINOR                          You talk of feeling idle and useless                           imagine how that is compounded when                           one has no choice and no hope                           whatsoever of any occupation.                 EDWARD nods and smiles at the irony of it.                                       EDWARD                          Our circumstances are therefore                           precisely the same.                                       ELINOR                          Except that you will inherit your                           fortune.                 He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness.                                       ELINOR                          We cannot even earn ours.                                       EDWARD                          Perhaps Margaret is right.                                       ELINOR                          Right?                                       EDWARD                          Piracy is our only option.                 They ride on in silence for a moment.                                       EDWARD                          What is swabbing exactly?                 INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE                 Dinner is over. JOHN and FANNY are examining plans of the                 Norland estate, looking for somewhere to build a hermitage.                 EDWARD is reading out loud. ELINOR embroiders and listens.                 MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE make up the rest of the audience,                 the latter in a state of high impatience.                                       EDWARD                          No voice divine the storm allayed No                           light propitious shone, When snatched                           from all effectual aid, We perished                           each alone: But I beneath a rougher                           sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs                           than he.                 MARIANNE jumps up and goes to him.                                       MARIANNE                          No, Edward! Listen.                 She takes the book from him and reads the stanza with                 passionate brio.                                       MARIANNE                          Can you not feel his despair? Try                           again.                 Rather mortified, EDWARD starts again, but not before                 receiving a sympathetic look from ELINOR which seems to                 comfort him a little.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - MORNING ROOM - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD is ruminating sadly. MARIANNE rushes in holding                 a letter.                                       MARIANNE                          Mamma, look. This has just arrived.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (reading from the                                letter)                           I should be pleased to offer you a                           home at Barton Cottage as soon as                           ever you have need of it  why, it is                           from my cousin, Sir John Middleton!                                       MARIANNE                          Even Elinor must approve the rent.                 MRS DASHWOOD looks at the letter again and thinks.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Has Elinor not yet seen this?                                       MARIANNE                          No I will fetch her.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Wait. No. Let us delay.                                       MARIANNE                          Why?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I think--I believe that Edward and                           Elinor have formed an attachment.                 Marianne nods, a little reluctantly.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          It would be cruel to take her away                           so soon and Devonshire is so far.                 MRS DASHWOOD makes her decision. She takes the letter and                 hides it in the pocket of her gown. MARIANNE looks on                 frowningly.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Why so grave? Do you disapprove her                           choice?                                       MARIANNE                          By no means. Edward is very amiable.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Amiable but?                                       MARIANNE                          But there is something wanting. He                           is too sedate his reading last night.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Elinor has not your feelings, his                           reserve suits her.                 MARIANNE thinks for a little.                                       MARIANNE                          Can he love her? Can the ardour of                           the soul really be satisfied with                           such polite, concealed affections?                           To love is to burn to be on fire,                           all made of passion, of adoration,                           of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or                           Guinevere or Heloise.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          They made rather pathetic ends, dear.                                       MARIANNE                          Pathetic! To die for love? How can                           you say so? What could be more                           glorious?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I think that may be taking your                           romantic sensibilities a little far.                                       MARIANNE                          The more I know of the world, the                           more I am convinced that I shall                           never see a man whom I can truly                           love.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          You require so much!                                       MARIANNE                          I do not! I require only what any                           young woman of taste should a man                           who sings well, dances admirably,                           rides bravely, reads with passion                           and whose tastes agree in every point                           with my own.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR S BEDROOM - NIGHT                 ELINOR is in bed, deep in thought. MARIANNE enters in her                 nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. She reads, teasingly.                                       MARIANNE                          Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It                           is immortal as immaculate truth  Tis                           not a blossom shed as soon as Youth                           Drops from the stem of life for it                           will grow In barren regions, where                           no waters flow Nor ray of promise                           cheats the pensive gloom--                 She jumps onto the bed. ELINOR smiles somewhat suspiciously.                                       MARIANNE                          What a pity it is that Edward has no                           passion for reading.                                       ELINOR                          It was you who asked him to read and                           then you made him nervous.                                       MARIANNE                          Me?                                       ELINOR                          But your behaviour to him in all                           other respects is perfectly cordial                           so I must assume that you like him                           in spite of his deficiencies.                                       MARIANNE                               (trying hard)                          I think him everything that is amiable                           and worthy.                                       ELINOR                          Praise indeed!                                       MARIANNE                          But he shall have my unanswering                           devotion when you tell me he is to                           be my brother.                 ELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply.                 Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately.                                       MARIANNE                          How shall I do without you?                                       ELINOR                          Do without me?                 MARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears.                                       MARIANNE                          I am sure you will be very happy.                           But you must promise not to live too                           far away.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, there is no question of                           that is, there is no under standing                           between...                 ELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly.                                       MARIANNE                          Do you love him?                 The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR.                                       ELINOR                          I do not attempt to deny that I think                           very highly of him that I greatly                           esteem that I like him.                                       MARIANNE                          Esteem him! Like him! Use those                           insipid words again and I shall leave                           the room this instant!                 This makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort.                                       ELINOR                          Very well. Forgive me. Believe my                           feelings to be stronger than I have                           declared but further than that you                           must not believe.                 MARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up                 her book again.                                       MARIANNE                           Is love a fancy or a feeling?  Or a                           Ferrars?                                       ELINOR                          Go to bed!                 ELINOR blushes in good earnest. MARIANNE goes to the door.                                       MARIANNE                               (imitating Elinor)                           I do not attempt to deny that I                           think highly of him greatly esteem                           him! Like him!                  And she is gone, leaving ELINOR both agitated and amused.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY                 FANNY is standing by the window looking out. We see her POV                 of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden.                 MRS DASHWOOD enters, pauses for a moment and then joins FANNY                 at the window. FANNY pretends not to have been watching but                 MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly                 at her.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          We are all so happy that you chose                           to invite Edward to Norland. He is a                           dear boy and we are all very fond of                           him.                 FANNY does a bit of quick thinking.                                       FANNY                          We have great hopes for him. Much is                           expected of him by our mother with                           regard to his profession                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Naturally.                                       FANNY                          And in marriage. She is determined                           that both he and Robert will marry                           well.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Of course. But I hope she desires                           them to marry for love, first and                           foremost? I have always felt that,                           contrary to common wisdom, true                           affection is by far the most valuable                           dowry.                                       FANNY                          Love is all very well, but                           unfortunately we cannot always rely                           on the heart to lead us in the most                           suitable directions.                 FANNY lowers her voice confidingly.                                       FANNY                          You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward                           is entirely the kind of compassionate                           person upon whom penniless women can                           prey--and having entered into any                           kind of understanding, he would never                           go back on his word. He is quite                           simply incapable of doing so. But it                           would lead to his ruin. I worry for                           him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has                           always made it perfectly plain that                           she will withdraw all financial                           support from Edward, should he choose                           to plant his affections in less...                           exalted ground than he deserves.                 It is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She                 is appalled and furious.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I understand you perfectly.                 She sweeps off.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD S DRESSING ROOM - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD, breathless with rage, is searching through her                 wardrobe for the gown which contains SIR JOHN s letter. Frocks                 fly hither and thither. Finally MRS DASHWOOD plunges her                 hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter. She                 looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious.                 INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE                 The entire family is present. Everyone is watching MRS                 DASHWOOD, who has just made her announcement.                                       EDWARD                          Devonshire!                 He is devastated. FANNY is thrilled. MRS DASHWOOD looks at                 him with compassion and then at ELINOR, who is trying to                 keep calm.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          My cousin Sir John Middleton has                           offered us a small house on his                           estate.                                       JOHN                          Sir John Middleton? What is his                           situation? He must be a man of                           property.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          He is a widower. He lives with his                           mother-in-law at Barton Park and it                           is Barton Cottage that he offers us.                                       FANNY                          Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little                           cottage is always very snug.                                       EDWARD                          But you will not leave before the                           summer?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer                           trespass upon your sister s good                           will. We must leave as soon as                           possible.                                       MARGARET                          You will come and stay with us,                           Edward!                                       EDWARD                          I should like that very much.                                       FANNY                          Edward has long been expected in                           town by our mother.                 MRS DASHWOOD ignores FANNY.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Come as soon as you can, Edward.                           Remember that you are always welcome.                 INT/EXT. NORLAND PARK - STABLES - DAY                 ELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE. She strokes the                 soft face sadly. Then she senses someone and turns to find                 EDWARD standing nearby.                                       EDWARD                          Cannot you take him with you?                                       ELINOR                          We cannot possibly afford him.                                       EDWARD                          Perhaps he could make himself useful                           in the kitchen?                 ELINOR tries to smile. EDWARD looks at her for a long moment                 and then comes closer.                                       EDWARD                          Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk                           to you.                 The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone--                stops ELINOR s breath altogether.                                       EDWARD                          There is something of great importance                           I need... to tell you--                 He comes closer still. The HORSE breathes between them. ELINOR                 is on fire with anticipation but EDWARD looks troubled and                 has less the air of a suitor than he might.                                       EDWARD                          --about--about my education.                                       ELINOR                               (after a beat)                          Your education?                                       EDWARD                          Yes. It was less... successful than                           it might have been.                 EDWARD laughs nervously. ELINOR is completely bewildered.                                       EDWARD                          It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly                           enough.                                       ELINOR                          Indeed?                                       EDWARD                          Yes. Do you know it?                                       ELINOR                          Plymouth?                                       EDWARD                          Yes.                                       ELINOR                          No.                                       EDWARD                          Oh--well--I spent four years there--                          at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt--                                       ELINOR                          Pratt?                 ELINOR is beginning to feel like a parrot.                                       EDWARD                          Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I--                          that is to say, he has a--                 As EDWARD flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this                 unexpected foray into his academic past.                                       FANNY                          Edward! Edward!                 They turn to find FANNY powering down upon them, waving a                 letter. EDWARD steps back, glancing almost guiltily at ELINOR,                 who is as confused as we are.                                       FANNY                          I have been all over for you! You                           are needed in London this instant!                                       EDWARD                          Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon                           as it is--                                       FANNY                          No, no, that will not do. Family                           affairs are in chaos owing to your                           absence. Mother is quite adamant                           that you should leave at once.                 FANNY is determined. She obviously has no intention of leaving                 him alone with ELINOR. EDWARD turns to ELINOR, frustration                 in every muscle, his jaw set tight.                                       EDWARD                          Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.                 FANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after                 them.                 INT. THE LADIES  CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - RAIN - EVE                 The DASHWOODS are on their way. The mood is very sombre.                                       MARGARET                          Edward promised he would bring the                           atlas to Barton for me.                 MARIANNE looks at ELINOR, pleased.                                       MARIANNE                          Did he? Well, I will wager he will                           do so in less than a fortnight!                 MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR with satisfaction.                 EXT. THE LADIES  CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - EVE                 The carriage rolls on.                                       MARGARET (V.O.)                          Are we there yet?                 EXT. ROAD TO AND FROM BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a                 damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely                 countryside.                 From one side we can see the DASHWOODS  carriage drawing up                 at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from                 which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY                 As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy-                 complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a                 rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen                 over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Sir John!                 SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path,                 followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly                 fascinated by his bouncy companion.                                       SIR JOHN                          Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my                           word, here you are, here you are,                           here you are!                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Sir John, your extraordinary kindness--                                       SIR JOHN                          Oh, none of that, hush, please, none                           of that, but here is my dear mamma-                          in-law Mrs Jennings.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Was the journey tolerable, you poor                           souls?                                       SIR JOHN                          Why did you not come up to the Park                           first and take your ease? We saw you                           pass--Like many people who live rather                           lonely lives together.                 SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each                 other all the time and never listen.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          --but I would not wait for you to                           come to us, I made John call for the                           carriage--                                       SIR JOHN                          She would not wait, you know.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          --as we get so little company.                 They reach the front door and BETSY s smiling welcome. In                 the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the                 lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house                 alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in                 V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire                 is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless.                                       MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)                          But I feel as if I know you already--                          delightful creatures!                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          Delightful! And you know you are to                           dine at Barton Park every day.                                       MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)                          Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot--                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall                           not brook refusals. I am quite deaf                           to  em, you know--                                       MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)                          --deaf--                 MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then                 she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up.                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          But I insist!                                       ELINOR (V.O.)                          Let us only settle in for a few days,                           Sir John, and thank you--                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          Oh, no thankings, no, please, can t                           bear  em, embarrassing, you know--                 MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another                 bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the                 stairs.                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          We will send game and fruit as a                           matter of course--                                       MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)                          --fruit and game--                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          --and the carriage is at your beck                           and call--                 MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          --call--and here is Miss Marianne!                                       SIR JOHN                          Where did you disappear to?                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I declare you are the loveliest girl                           I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get                           them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must                           not leave it too long!                                       SIR JOHN                          But, alas, there are no smart young                           men hereabouts to woo them--                                       MRS JENNINGS                          --not a beau for miles!                 The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to                 tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly.                                       SIR JOHN                          Come, Mother, let us leave them in                           peace.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          But there is Colonel Brandon!                 SIR JOHN is dragging her down the path.                                       SIR JOHN                          Excellent fellow! We served in the                           East India Regiment together.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Just wait till he sees you! If we                           can persuade him out to meet you!                                       SIR JOHN                          Reclusive individual. But you are                           fatigued. I can see that you are                           fatigued.                 Now he is pushing her into the carriage.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Of course she is fatigued!                                       SIR JOHN                          Come along, Mother, we really must                           leave them to themselves.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          You must get your maidservant to                           make you up some camphor--it is the                           best tonic for the staggers!                                       SIR JOHN                          Send Thomas to us for the carriage                           when you are ready!                 They take off, waving wildly. MARGARET goes down the path to                 watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.                                       MARGARET                          I like them.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (weakly)                          What generosity.                                       ELINOR                          Indeed. I am surprised they did not                           offer us their clothing.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - NIGHT                 MARIANNE and ELINOR are getting undressed for bed. it s very                 cold. They keep their underclothing on and get in, shivering                 at the bony chill of the linen.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY                 BETSY is pinning out laundry.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY                 MARGARET tries to climb an impossible tree. Her petticoats                 snag and tear.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - DAY                 MARIANNE looks out of the window at the wild countryside.                 Uncon sciously, one hand plays up and down on the sill as                 though it were a keyboard.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 ELINOR sits at a little desk counting money and making notes.                 BETSY enters to clean out the fire. She notices the money.                                       BETSY                          Sugar is five shilling a pound these                           parts, Miss Dashwood.                                       ELINOR                               (lightly)                          No more sugar then.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - EVE                 CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD looking out of the window, thinking.                 She remembers MRS JENNINGS s words:                                       MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)                          Not a beau for miles.                 MRS DASHWOOD turns into the room to look at her brood. ELINOR                 and MARIANNE are mending MARGARET s petticoats. CLOSE on the                 mother s anxious expression--what is to become of them?                 EXT. BARTON PARK - EVE                 Establishing shot of SIR JOHN s house--a very comfortable-                looking country seat with fine grounds.                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I                           hope he has not lamed his horse.                 INT. BARTON PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE                 CLOSE on an empty chair and place setting. Pull out to reveal                 the DASHWOODS at their first dinner with SIR JOHN and MRS                 JENNINGS.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Colonel Brandon is the most eligible                           bachelor in the county--he is bound                           to do for one of you. Mind, he is a                           better age for Miss Dashwood--but I                           dare say she left her heart behind                           in Sussex, eh?                 MARIANNE flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern                 at her sister, which MRS JENNINGS notices.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I                           think I have unearthed a secret!                                       SIR JOHN                          Oho! Have you sniffed one out already,                           Mother? You are worse than my best                           pointer, Flossie!                 They both laugh immoderately. ELINOR tries to stay calm.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood?                           Is he butcher, baker, candlestick-                          maker? I shall winkle it out of you                           somehow, you know!                                       SIR JOHN                          She s horribly good at winkling.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          You are in lonely country now, Miss                           Dashwood, none of us has any secrets                           here--                                       SIR JOHN                          --or if we do, we do not keep them                           for long!                 ELINOR tries to smile. MARIANNE looks furious. MARGARET is                 staring at MRS JENNINGS as if she were some particularly                 thrilling form of wildlife.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          He is curate of the parish, I dare                           say!                                       SIR JOHN                          Or a handsome lieutenant!                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he                           in uniform?                 ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts                 her.                                       MARGARET                          He has no profession!                 SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight.                 ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other                 helplessly.                                       SIR JOHN                          No profession! A gentleman, then!                                       MARIANNE                               (with daggers)                          Margaret, you know perfectly well                           there is no such person.                                       MARGARET                          There is! There is! And his name                           begins with an F!                 ELINOR looks hard at her plate.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Margaret!                 MRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest s relish for such a                 vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop.                                       SIR JOHN                          F indeed! A very promising letter.                           Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word,                           but I cannot think of a single name                           beginning with F--                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty?                 MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are                 so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE.                                       MARIANNE                               (controlled fury)                          Sir John, might I play your                           pianoforte?                                       SIR JOHN                          Of course, yes--my goodness. We do                           not stand on ceremony here, my dear.                 For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister s rudeness as                 everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out.                 EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE                 A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is                 dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE s                 song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression                 of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.                 INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE                 Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind                 them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of                 the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes                 at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing.                 He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence                 and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back,                 slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN                 ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his                 seat.                                       SIR JOHN                          Brandon! Where have you been? Come,                           come and meet our beautiful new                           neighbours!                                       MRS JENNINGS                          What a pity you are late, Colonel!                           You have missed the most delightful                           singing!                 BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          A great pity, indeed.                 ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled.                                       SIR JOHN                          Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear                           friend Colonel Brandon? We served                           together in the East Indies and I                           assure you there is no better fellow                           on earth--                                       MARGARET                          Have you really been to the East                           Indies, Colonel?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I have.                                       MARGARET                          What is it like?                 MARGARET is quivering with fascination.                                       SIR JOHN                          Like? Hot.                 But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                               (mysteriously)                          The air is full of spices.                 MARGARET smiles with satisfaction.                                       SIR JOHN                          Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn                           to entertain us!                                       ELINOR                          Oh no, Sir John, I do not--                                       SIR JOHN                          --and I think we can all guess what                           key you will sing in!                 SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke.                                       SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS                          F major!                 They fall about.                 INT. SIR JOHN S CARRIAGE - NIGHT                 The DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress.                                       MARIANNE                               (to Margaret)                          As for you, you have no right, no                           right at all, to parade your ignorant                           assumptions--                                       MARGARET                          They are not assumptions. You told                           me.                 ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks                 MARGARET again.                                       MARIANNE                          I told you nothing--                                       MARGARET                          They ll meet him when he comes,                           anyway.                                       MARIANNE                          That is not the point. You do not                           speak of such things before strangers--                                       MARGARET                          But everyone else was--                                       MARIANNE                          Mrs Jennings is not everyone.                                       MARGARET                          I like her! She talks about things.                           We never talk about things.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Hush, please, now that is enough,                           Margaret. If you cannot think of                           anything appropriate to say, you                           will please restrict your remarks to                           the weather.                 A heated pause.                                       MARGARET                          I like Colonel Brandon too. He s                           been to places.                 EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - DAY                 In the background, SIR JOHN, ELINOR and MRS JENNINGS pack                 the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS DASHWOOD and                 MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is                 cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she                 saws impatiently.                 COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers                 her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She                 turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The                 COLONEL s gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.                 INT. KEEPER S LODGE - BARTON PARK - DAY                 SIR JOHN and BRANDON are cleaning their guns in companionable                 silence--a habit left over from army days. SIR JOHN eyes                 BRANDON roguishly.                                       SIR JOHN                          You know what they re saying, of                           course...                 No answer.                                       SIR JOHN                          The word is that you have developed                           a taste for--certain company.                 BRANDON stays resolutely silent. SIR JOHN is emboldened.                                       SIR JOHN                          And why not, say I. A man like you--                          in his prime--she d be a most                           fortunate young lady--                 BRANDON cuts across him.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Marianne Dashwood would no more think                           of me than she would of you, John.                                       SIR JOHN                          Brandon, my boy, do not think of                           yourself so meanly--                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          And all the better for her.                 SIR JOHN subsides. BRANDON is clearly as angry with himself                 as he is with SIR JOHN.                 EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - ANOTHER DAY                 BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one                 arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between                 its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then                 stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes                 his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.                 EXT. BARTON PARK - GARDENS - DAY                 An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking                 to MRS DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE,                 who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS                 JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON.                                       MRS JENNINGS                               (stage whisper)                          Besotted! Excellent match, for he is                           rich and she is handsome.                                       ELINOR                          How long have you known the Colonel?                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever                           I have been here, and I came fifteen                           years back. His estate at Delaford                           is but four miles hence and he and                           John are very thick. He has no wife                           or children of his own, for--                 MRS JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          --he has a tragic history. He loved                           a girl once--twenty years ago now--a                           ward to his family, but they were                           not permitted to marry...                 ELINOR is intrigued.                                       ELINOR                          On what grounds?                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Money. Eliza was poor. When the father                           discovered their amour, she was flung                           out of the house and he packed off                           into the army. I believe he would                           have done himself a harm if not for                           John...                                       ELINOR                          What became of the lady?                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Oh, she was passed from man to man--                          disappeared from all good society.                           When Brandon got back from India he                           searched for heaven knows how long,                           only to find her dying in a poor                           house. You have seen how it has                           affected him. Once I thought my                           daughter Charlotte might have cheered                           him up, but she is much better off                           where she is.                 ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Look at him now, though. So attentive.                           I shall try an experiment on him.                                       ELINOR                          Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings,                           leave the poor Colonel alone.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          No, no, it is just the thing--all                           suitors need a little help, my dear                 MRS JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though                 about to perform a magic trick.                                       MRS JENNINGS                               (trillingly)                          Colonel Brandon!                 BRANDON looks up.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          We have not heard you play for us of                           late!                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          For the simple reason that you have                           a far superior musician here.                 He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Perhaps you did not know, Miss                           Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares                           your passion for music and plays the                           piano forte very well.                 MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Play us a duet!                 BRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I ll trow you know quite as many                           melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!                 Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Come! Let us see you both side by                           side!                 MARIANNE rises impatiently.                                       MARIANNE                          I do not know any duets. Forgive me,                           Colonel.                 She moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - LATE AFTERNOON                 The DASHWOODS returning. MARIANNE is taking her bonnet off                 so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and                 tighter. Despite them selves, ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are                 amused.                                       MARIANNE                          Oh! Are we never to have a moment s                           peace? The rent here may be low but                           I think we have it on very hard terms.                                       ELINOR                          Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with                           a married daughter--she has nothing                           to do but marry off everyone else s.                 BETSY pokes her head out from the dining room.                                       BETSY                          There s a parcel arrived for you,                           Miss Dashwood!                                       MARGARET                          A parcel!                 They all crowd into the dining room to find a large package                 on the table, which MARGARET is permitted to open. In the                 meantime ELINOR comes to the rescue with the bonnet and                 MARIANNE stands shifting like a spirited mare as ELINOR                 patiently unravels the knot.                                       MARIANNE                          It is too ridiculous! When is a man                           to be safe from such wit if age and                           infirmity do not protect him?                                       ELINOR                          Infirmity!                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I                           am at death s door.                                       ELINOR                          It is a miracle your life has extended                           this far...                                       MARIANNE                          Did you not hear him complain of a                           rheumatism in his shoulder?                                       ELINOR                          A slight ache  I believe was his                           phrase...                 MARIANNE smiles and ELINOR laughs at her. Then MARGARET opens                 the parcel to reveal--her atlas. The atmosphere alters                 immediately as MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE look at ELINOR in                 consternation.                                       MARGARET                          But Edward said he would bring it                           himself.                 There is a letter on top of the atlas. CLOSE on the address                  To the Dashwoods . MRS DASHWOOD picks it up, looks at ELINOR,                 and opens                                       MRS DASHWOOD                           Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,                           Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret--                          it gives me great pleasure to restore                           this atlas to its rightful owner.                           Alas, business in London does not                           permit me to accompany it, although                           this is likely to hurt me far more                           than it hurts you. For the present                           my memories of your kindness must be                           enough to sustain me, and I remain                           your devoted servant always. E. C.                           Ferrars.                  A silence greets this brief epistle. ELINOR struggles to                 contain her bitter disappointment.                                       MARGARET                          But why hasn t he come?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          He says he is busy, dear.                                       MARGARET                          He said he d come.                 MARGARET is genuinely upset. ELINOR quietly hangs up                 MARIANNE s bonnet.                                       MARGARET                          Why hasn t he come?                 MRS DASHWOOD looks beseechingly at MARIANNE, who nods and                 grasps MARGARET s hand.                                       MARIANNE                          I am taking you for a walk.                                       MARGARET                          No! I ve been a walk.                                       MARIANNE                          You need another.                                       MARGARET                          It is going to rain.                 MARIANNE shoves her bonnet back on and drags MARGARET out.                                       MARIANNE                          It is not going to rain.                                       MARGARET                          You always say that and then it always                           does.                 We hear the front door slam behind them. There is a short                 silence.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad                           influence.                 She approaches ELINOR.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          You must miss him, Elinor.                 ELINOR looks very directly at her mother.                                       ELINOR                          We are not engaged, Mamma.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          But he loves you, dearest, of that I                           am certain.                 ELINOR looks down. She speaks slowly, choosing her words                 with care.                                       ELINOR                          I am by no means assured of his regard                           for me.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Oh, Elinor!                                       ELINOR                          But even were he to feel such a...                           preference, I think we should be                           foolish to assume that there would                           not be many obstacles to his choosing                           a woman of no rank who cannot afford                           to buy sugar...                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          But Elinor--your heart must tell you--                                       ELINOR                          In such a situation, Mamma, it is                           perhaps better to use one s head.                 She clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the                 accounts book and opens it. MRS DASHWOOD is silenced.                 EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 MARIANNE walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling MARGARET                 behind her.                 EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 It has started to rain. Mists are gathering around the two                 figures walking against the wind.                                       MARIANNE                          Is there any felicity in the world                           superior to this?                                       MARGARET                          I told you it would rain.                                       MARIANNE                          Look! There is some blue sky! Let us                           chase it!                                       MARGARET                          I m not supposed to run.                 MARIANNE runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist.                 MARGARET stumbles after her, grumbling. We follow MARIANNE                 in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips                 and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.                                       MARGARET                          Marianne!                                       MARIANNE                          Help me!                 She tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great.                 She sinks back to the ground. MARGARET is very alarmed.                                       MARIANNE                          Margaret, run home and fetch help.                 The mists have thickened. They can no longer see where they                 are. Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders                 bravely and tries to sense the direction.                                       MARGARET                          I think it is this way. I will run                           as fast as I can, Marianne.                 She dashes off. As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder                 of hooves.                 CU Margaret s terrified expression. They seem to be coming                 from all around. She wheels and turns and then--Crash! Through                 the mist breaks a huge white horse. Astride sits an Adonis                 in hunting gear. MARGARET squeals. The horse rears. Its rider                 controls it and slides off. He rushes to MARIANNE s side.                                       THE STRANGER                          Are you hurt?                                       MARIANNE                               (transfixed)                          Only my ankle.                                       THE STRANGER                          May I have your permission to--                 He indicates her leg. Decorous, perhaps faintly impish.                                       THE STRANGER                          --ascertain if there are any breaks?                 MARIANNE nods speechlessly. With great delicacy, he feels                 her ankle. MARGARET s eyes are out on chapel-hooks. MARIANNE                 almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed.                                       THE STRANGER                          It is not broken. Now, can you put                           your arm about my neck?                 MARIANNE does not need any encouragement. He lifts her                 effortlessly and calls to his horse:  Bedivere!  It trots                 obediently forward. The STRANGER smiles down at MARIANNE.                                       THE STRANGER                          Allow me to escort you home.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - DINING ROOM - DAY                 Rain is thudding against the window from which MRS DASHWOOD                 turns, looking very worried.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Marianne was sure it would not rain.                                       ELINOR                          Which invariably means it will.                 But we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her                 mother. There are noises in the hall.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          At last!                 MARGARET runs into the room dripping wet.                                       MARGARET                          She fell over! She fell down--and                           he s carrying her!                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR rush to the front door. They see the                 STRANGER carrying MARIANNE up the garden path, his scarlet                 coat staining the monochrome rain.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Marianne!                 The STRANGER reaches the door. This is no time for                 introductions.                                       ELINOR                          In here, sir--this way. Margaret,                           open the door wider. Please, sir,                           lay her here. Marianne, are you in                           pain?                 They move into the parlour.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 MARIANNE is carried in, surrounded by ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD                 and MARGARET.                                       THE STRANGER                          It is a twisted ankle.                                       MARIANNE                          Do not be alarmed, Mamma.                 The STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight                 into each other s eyes. Electric.                                       THE STRANGER                          I can assure you it is not serious.                           I took the liberty of feeling the                           bone and it is perfectly sound.                 ELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her                 roots.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Sir, I cannot even begin to thank                           you.                                       THE STRANGER                          Please do not think of it. I m                           honoured of be of service.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Will you not be seated?                                       THE STRANGER                          Pray excuse me--I have no desire to                           leave a water mark! But permit me to                           call tomorrow afternoon and inquire                           after the patient?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          We shall look forward to it!                 He turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously.                 He bows, and sweeps out of the room.                                       MARIANNE                               (hissing)                          His name! His name!                 MRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out                 with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET                 pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing                 MARIANNE s boot and trying not to laugh at her.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Please tell us to whom we are so                           much obliged?                 The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her.                                       THE STRANGER                          John Willoughby of Allenham--your                           servant, ma am!                 And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere                 to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD s excited expression.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with                 excitement and anxiety.                                       MARIANNE                          Mr John Willoughby of Allenham!                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          What an impressive gentleman!                                       MARIANNE                          He lifted me as if I weighed no more                           than a dried leaf!                                       ELINOR                          Is he human?                 MARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Tell me if I hurt you.                                       ELINOR                               (regarding Marianne s                                ecstatic expression)                          She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret,                           ask Betsy to make up a cold compress,                           please.                                       MARGARET                               (leaving reluctantly)                          Did you see him? He expressed himself                           well, did he not?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          With great decorum and honour.                                       MARIANNE                          And spirit and wit and feeling.                                       ELINOR                          And economy--ten words at most.                 From below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me!                                       MARIANNE                          And he is to come tomorrow!                                       ELINOR                          You must change, Marianne--you will                           catch a cold.                                       MARIANNE                          What care I for colds when there is                           such a man?                                       ELINOR                          You will care very much when your                           nose swells up.                                       MARIANNE                          You are right. Help me, Elinor.                 MARGARET comes back with the bandages.                                       MARGARET                          What has happened?                                       ELINOR                          We have decided to give you to the                           Gypsies.                 ELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS                 DASHWOOD.                                       MARGARET                          Will they be married before Edward                           and Elinor, do you think, Mamma?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Margaret, you are worse than Mrs                           Jennings.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING                 The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN s horse munches grass                 contentedly by the side of the road.                                       SIR JOHN (V.O.)                          Mr Willoughby is well worth catching,                           Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must                           not expect to have all the men to                           herself!                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING                 The DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling                 information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn                 only anxious to protect BRANDON s interest. MARIANNE has her                 bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.                                       MARIANNE                          But what do you know of Mr Willoughby,                           Sir John?                                       SIR JOHN                          Decent shot--and there is not a bolder                           rider in all England.                                       MARIANNE                          But what is he like?                                       SIR JOHN                          Like?                                       MARIANNE                          What are his tastes? His passions?                           His pursuits?                                       SIR JOHN                               (mystified)                          Well, he has the nicest little bitch                           of a pointer--was she out with him                           yesterday?                 MARIANNE gives up. MRS DASHWOOD takes over.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Where is Allenham, Sir John?                                       SIR JOHN                          Nice little estate three miles east.                           He is to inherit it from an elderly                           relative--Lady Allen is her name.                 Now they are getting somewhere. MARIANNE is about to ask                 another question when they hear a horse galloping up. Everyone                 is electrified. MARGARET runs to the window and turns back                 in disappointment.                                       MARGARET                          It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go                           outside and keep watch.                 MARGARET runs out of the room.                                       SIR JOHN                          You are all on the lookout for                           Willoughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon.                           You will none of you think of him                           now.                 BRANDON is admitted by BETSY. He is carrying a large bunch                 of hothouse flowers.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          How is the invalid?                 He hands MARIANNE the flowers with a smile.                                       MARIANNE                          Thank you so much, Colonel.                 She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR, who goes                 for a vase. SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff                 insensitivity.                                       SIR JOHN                          Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you                           should set your cap at Mr Willoughby                           when you have already made such a                           splendid conquest!                                       MARIANNE                          I have no intention of  setting my                           cap  at anyone, Sir John!                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen s nephew?                 BRANDON s light tone betrays no emotion. ELINOR comes back                 in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to                 MARIANNE.                                       SIR JOHN                          Aye, he visits every year for he is                           to inherit Allenham--and he has a                           very pretty estate of his own, Miss                           Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset.                           If I were you, I would not give him                           up to my younger sister in spite of                           all this tumbling down hills.                 Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming  Marianne s preserver!                  at the top of her voice. Everyone starts to move at once.                 MARGARET is silenced. BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, whose                 incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.                                       SIR JOHN                          Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon--                          we know when we are not wanted. Let                           us leave him to the ladies!                                       ELINOR                          Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel                           are leaving.                 MARIANNE looks up, suddenly self-conscious.                                       MARIANNE                          Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the                           flowers.                 ELINOR sees them out. We hear WILLOUGHBY s voice outside.                 CLOSE on MARIANNE s radiant anticipation.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY                 WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and SIR                 JOHN.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          How do you do, Colonel?                                       SIR JOHN                          How does he do? How do you do, more                           like. Go on in, they re waiting for                           you!                 BRANDON looks at WILLOUGHBY for a moment. He bows. WILLOUGHBY                 bows. Then BRANDON and SIR JOHN exit.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 ELINOR leads in WILLOUGHBY. MRS DASHWOOD greets him with                 outstretched arms.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to                           see you again!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          The pleasure is all mine, I can                           asstire you. I trust Miss Marianne                           has not caught cold?                                       MARIANNE                          You have found out my name!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Of course. The neighbourhood is                           crawling with my spies.                 He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his                 back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly, humorous                 bow.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          And since you cannot venture out to                           nature, nature must be brought to                           you!                                       MARIANNE                          How beautiful. These are not from                           the hothouse.                 WILLOUGHBY sees BRANDON s flowers.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Ah! I see mine is not the first                           offering, nor the most elegant. I am                           afraid I obtained these from an                           obliging field.                                       MARIANNE                          But I have always preferred wild                           flowers!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          I suspected as much.                 ELINOR takes the delicate flowers from WILLOUGHBY.                                       ELINOR                          I will put these in water.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is                           beyond expression--                                       WILLOUGHBY                          But it is I who am grateful. I have                           often passed this cottage and grieved                           for its lonely state--and then the                           first news I had from Lady Allen                           when I arrived was that it was taken.                           I felt a peculiar interest in the                           event which nothing can account for                           but my present delight in meeting                           you.                 He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR                 brings back WILLOUGHBY s flowers and places them next to                 BRANDON s on the side table.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby.                 She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on                 MARIANNE s footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight--                sits down on the stool at her feet.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Who is reading Shakespeare s sonnets?                 Everyone answers at once.                                       MARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD                          I am. / We all are. / Marianne.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Marianne has been reading them out                           to us.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Which are your favourites?                 It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it.                                       MARIANNE                          Without a doubt, mine is 116.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Let me not to the marriage of true                           minds Admit impediments. Love is not                           love Which alters when it alteration                           finds, Or bends with the remover to                           remove--then how does it go?                                       MARIANNE                           0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.                  WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues.                 ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their                 contribution to this conversation will be minimal.                                       WILLOUGHBY                           That looks on storms --or is it                           tempests? Let me find it.                 WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          It is strange you should be reading                           them--for, look, I carry this with                           me always.                 It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted,                 and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity,                 they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though                 they were already intimates.                 MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR,                 amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and                 MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY                 WILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE s bunch                 in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile                 as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE                 supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets                           are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman                           against further injury!                                       MARIANNE                          Goodbye! Thank you!                 He gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the                 road for a while.                                       ELINOR                          Good work, Marianne! You have covered                           all forms of poetry; another meeting                           will ascertain his views on nature                           and romantic attachments and then                           you will have nothing left to talk                           about and the acquaintanceship will                           be over.                                       MARIANNE                          I suppose I have erred against                           decorum. I should have been dull and                           spiritless and talked only of the                           weather, or the state of the roads.                                       ELINOR                          No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no                           doubt of your enthusiasm for him.                                       MARIANNE                          Why should he doubt it? Why should I                           hide my regard?                                       ELINOR                          No particular reason, Marianne, only                           that we know so little of him--                                       MARIANNE                          But time alone does not determine                           intimacy. Seven years would be                           insufficient to make some people                           acquainted with each other and seven                           days are more than enough for others.                                       ELINOR                          Or seven hours in this case.                                       MARIANNE                          I feel I know Mr Willoughby well                           already. If I had weaker, more shallow                           feelings perhaps I could conceal                           them, as you do--                 Then she realises what she s said.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Marianne, that is not fair--                                       MARIANNE                          I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean                                       ELINOR                          I know. Do not trouble yourself,                           Marianne.                 ELINOR turns back into the house.                                       MARIANNE                          I do not understand her, Mamma. Why                           does she never mention Edward? I                           have never even seen her cry about                           him, or about Norland.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or                           I, dear. She does not like to be                           swayed by her emotions.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - DAY                 CLOSE on Edward s handkerchief. We can see the monogram ECF                 clearly.                 CLOSE on ELINOR staring out of the window. Tears stand in                 her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before                 they fall.                 INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE                 After dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON,                 MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner                 of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a                 silhouette.                 WILLOUGHBY s profile glows behind the screen in front of                 her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty.                 The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven t                 you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full                 of laughter. They look at each other.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are at the accounts. WILLOUGHBY and                 MARIANNE are on the other side of the room in the window                 seat, whispering together. Clearly, he is already part of                 the family.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Surely you are not going to deny us                           beef as well as sugar?                                       ELINOR                          There is nothing under tenpence a                           pound. We have to economise.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Do you want us to starve?                                       ELINOR                          No. Just not to eat beef.                 MRS DASHWOOD is silenced but sighs crossly. ELINOR looks                 over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting                 off a lock of MARIANNE s hair, which he kisses and places in                 his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic                 moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps                 her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she                 has written  Edward  at the top of the sheet. Hastily she                 rubs it out and writes  Expenses .                 EXT. BARTON CHURCH. DAY.                 MRS JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other                 PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY s curricle (the                 eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying                 by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS                 JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS                 stare after them and comment to each other.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY                 MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together.                 MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently                 started indoors and is being continued here.                                       MARIANNE                          If there was any true impropriety in                           my behaviour, I should be sensible                           of it, Elinor--                                       ELINOR                          But as it has already exposed you to                           some very impertinent remarks, do                           you not begin to doubt your own                           discretion?                                       MARIANNE                          If the impertinent remarks of such                           as Mrs Jennings are proof of                           impropriety, then we are all offending                           every moment of our lives--                 The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON                 on horseback.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                               (dismounting)                          Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!                                       ELINOR                          Good morning, Colonel!                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I come to issue an invitation. A                           picnic on my estate at Delaford--if                           you would care to join us on Thursday                           next. Mrs Jennings s daughter and                           her husband are traveling up                           especially.                                       ELINOR                          Thank you, Colonel, we shall be                           delighted.                 At that moment, WILLOUGHBY s curricle hoves into view and                 MARIANNE s face lights up.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                               (to Marianne)                          I will of course be including Mr                           Willoughby in the party.                 Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her                 manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.                                       MARIANNE                          I should be delighted to join you,                           Colonel!                 The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods                 with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good                           morning, Colonel.                                       MARIANNE                          The Colonel has invited us to                           Delaford, Willoughby!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Excellent. I understand you have a                           particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.                 The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          A Broadwood Grand.                                       MARIANNE                          A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really                           be able to play for you!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          We shall look forward to it!                 MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up                 the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.                 BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then                 collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than                 satisfied with their behaviour.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Your sister seems very happy.                                       ELINOR                          Yes. Marianne does not approve of                           hiding her emotions. In fact, her                           romantic prejudices have the                           unfortunate tendency to set propriety                           at naught.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          She is wholly unspoilt.                                       ELINOR                          Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The                           sooner she becomes acquainted with                           the ways of the world, the better.                 COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very                 deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I knew a lady like your sister--the                           same impulsive sweetness of temper--                          who was forced into, as you put it,                           a better acquaintance with the world.                           The result was only ruination and                           despair.                 He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.                 EXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY                 People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the                 atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising                 the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON                 is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are                 three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a                 stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking                 GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE,                 MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.                 MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the                 road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood,                           when Charlotte and her lord and master                           appeared with our cousin Lucy! The                           last person I expected to see!  Where                           did you pop out from, Miss?  says I.                           I was never so surprised to see anyone                           in all my life!                 LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS                 continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          She probably came on purpose to share                           the fun, for there are no funds for                           such luxuries at home, poor thing.                                       LUCY                          I had not seen you for so long, dear                           Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the                           opportunity.                                       CHARLOTTE                          Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses                           Dashwood she wanted to see, not                           Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing                           but  Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood                           that  for I don t know how long! And                           what do you think of them now you do                           see them, Lucy? My mother has talked                           of nothing else in her letters since                           you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr                           Palmer--are they not the very                           creatures she describes?                 MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted                 expression.                                       MR PALMER                          Nothing like.                                       CHARLOTTE                               (laughing gaily)                          Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are                           quite rude today? He is to be an MP,                           you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is                           very fatiguing for him for he is                           forced to make everybody like him--                          he says it is quite shocking--                                       MRS PALMER                          I never said anything so irrational.                           Don t palm all your abuses of the                           language upon me.                                       MRS JENNINGS                               (to Mrs Dashwood)                          Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always                           out of humour.                 MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege.                 WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves                 to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE                 and points to MARIANNE.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Here he is! Now you shall see,                           Charlotte.                 WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making                 her laugh.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          How now, Mr Willoughby! You must                           greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr                           Palmer--                                       WILLOUGHBY                          How do you do?                                       MRS JENNINGS                          And my little cousin, Miss Lucy                           Steele.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!                 LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely,                 leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS                 coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.                                       CHARLOTTE                          I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--                          not that I ever spoke to him but I                           have seen him forever in town. Your                           sister is monstrous lucky to get                           him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is                           in love with her as well, which is a                           very great compliment for he hardly                           ever falls in love with anyone.                 ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to                 the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs                 with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.                                       LUCY                          May I beg a seat beside you, Miss                           Dashwood? I have so longed to make                           your better acquaintance! I have                           heard nothing but the highest praise                           for you.                 ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.                                       ELINOR                          I would be delighted. But Sir John                           and Mrs Jennings are too excessive                           in their compliments. I am sure to                           disappoint.                                       LUCY                          No, for it was from quite another                           source that I heard you praised and                           one not at all inclined to                           exaggeration.                 LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though                 not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN                 thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face                 the new arrival.                                       SIR JOHN                          What can this be?                 It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride.                 He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which                 BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed                 curiosity.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          My horse! Quickly!                                       SIR JOHN                          What is the matter, Brandon?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I must away to London.                                       SIR JOHN                          No! Impossible!                 Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified.                 A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL s horse.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Imperative.                 There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN                 is embarrassed and protests again.                                       SIR JOHN                          But Brandon, we are all assembled.                           We cannot picnic at Delaford without                           our host! Go up to town tomorrow.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Or wait till we return and start                           then--you would not be six hours                           later.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I cannot afford to lose one minute.                 As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency                 silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone                 stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start                 to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.                                       LUCY                          Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it!                           Just when I was to have the                           opportunity of speaking with you.                 EXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 Having been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY                 have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering                 restlessly about.                 The weather is sublime.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Frailty, thy name is Brandon!                                       MARIANNE                          There are some people who cannot                           bear a party of pleasure. I think he                           wrote the letter himself as a trick                           for getting out of it.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (indulgently)                          You are a very wicked pair, Colonel                           Brandon will be sadly missed.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Why? When he is the kind of man that                           everyone speaks well of and no one                           wants to talk to.                                       MARIANNE                          Exactly!                                       ELINOR                          Nonsense.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Colonel Brandon is very highly                           esteemed at the Park.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Which is enough censure in itself.                                       ELINOR                               (half laughing)                          Really, Willoughby!                                       WILLOUGHBY                               (imitating Mrs Jennings                                perfectly)                          Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you                           and your wicked ways--oh!                 He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing                 her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her                 shoulder.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your                           beau, reveal him, I say! Let s have                           no secrets between friends! Let me                           winkle them out of you!                 ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles                 off to MARIANNE.                                       WILLOUGHBY                               (as Mrs Jennings)                          I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do                           not have you married to the Colonel                           by teatime, I shall swallow my own                           bonnet.                 MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          As if you could marry such a                           character.                                       ELINOR                          Why should you dislike him?                 There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY s raillery. He flicks                 ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to                 her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Because he has threatened me with                           rain when I wanted it fine, he has                           found fault with the balance of my                           curricle and I cannot persuade him                           to buy my brown mare. If it will be                           of any satisfaction to you, however,                           to be told I believe his character                           to be in all other respects                           irreproachable, I am ready to confess                           it. And in return for an                           acknowledgement that must give me                           some pain.                               (he is slowing down)                          You cannot deny me the privilege...                               (slower still)                          of disliking him...                               (and stopping)                          as much as I adore...                 He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The                 expression on WILLOUGHBY s face is heart-stopping. MARGARET                 has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.                 ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them                 with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.                 Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from                 MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          --this cottage!                 The tension is broken. MARGARET starts to chew again.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I have great plans for improvements                           to it, you know, Mr Willoughby.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Now that I will never consent to.                           Not a stone must be added to its                           walls. Were I rich enough, I would                           instantly pull down Combe Magna and                           build it up again in the exact image                           of that cottage!                                       ELINOR                          With dark, narrow stairs, a poky                           hall and a fire that smokes?                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Especially the fire that smokes!                           Then I might be as happy at Combe                           Magna as I have been at Barton.                 He looks at MARIANNE, who has gone to sit at her mother s                 feet.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          But this place has one claim on my                           affection which no other can possibly                           share.                 MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like                 an angel.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Promise me you will never change it.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I do not have the heart.                                       ELINOR                          Or the money.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH AND GATE - DUSK                 MARIANNE is seeing WILLOUGHBY off.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Miss Marianne, will you--will you do                           me the honour of granting me an                           interview tomorrow--alone?                                       MARIANNE                          Willoughby, we are always alone!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          But there is something very particular                           I should like to ask you.                 There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel                 shy.                                       MARIANNE                          Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I                           may stay behind from church.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Thank you. Until tomorrow then--Miss                           Marianne.                 He mounts Bedivere and leaves. MARIANNE looks after him, her                 eyes shining. He is coming to propose.                 EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHT                 A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of                 LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In                 the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who                 sway and reel into the night.                 A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance                 to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows.                 The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for                 him. He strides inside.                 INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                 Stepping over a supine BEGGAR at the foot of the stairs, the                 HORSEMAN flings back his hood--it is BRANDON, hollow-eyed                 and dropping with weariness. We follow him up the stairs to                 a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.                 INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT                 He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from                 the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window                 stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns.                 BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an                 expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is                 heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his                 arms.                 INT. BARTON CHURCH - DAY                 Amongst the small CONGREGATION listening to the sermon drone                 on, we see the excited faces of ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS                 DASHWOOD.                                       MARGARET                          Do you think he will kneel down when                           he asks her?                                       ELINOR                          Shhh!                                       MARGARET                               (with satisfaction)                          They always kneel down.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY                 The DASHWOODS return from church to find THOMAS grooming                 Bedivere at the garden gate. Their excitement mounts.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY                 They all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order                 to signal their presence. MARGARET giggles. Suddenly, MARIANNE                 bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the                 room opposite. ELINOR and MARGARET stand by the door in utter                 consternation, while MRS DASH- WOOD goes to MARIANNE.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          What is wrong, my dearest?                 MARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY                 standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Willoughby! What is the matter?                                       WILLOUGHBY                          I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am                           sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has                           exercised the privilege of riches                           upon a dependent cousin and is sending                           me to London.                 He cannot look any of them in the eye.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          When--this morning?                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Almost this moment.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          How very disappointing! But your                           business will not detain you from us                           for long, I hope?                                       WILLOUGHBY                          You are very kind--but I have no                           idea of returning immediately to                           Devonshire. I am seldom invited to                           Allenham more than once a year.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait                           for an invitation from Barton Cottage?                                       WILLOUGHBY                          My engagements at present are of                           such a nature--that is--I dare not                           flatter myself--                 The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a                 glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          It is folly to linger in this manner.                           I will not torment myself further.                 He rushes past them and out of the cottage. They follow him                 to the door.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY                 The DASHWOODS cluster round the door.                                       MARGARET                          Willoughby, come back!                 She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere s                 reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 They all rush back into the parlour.                                       ELINOR                          Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to                           make a cup of hot tea for Marianne.                 MARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms                 around MARIANNE.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          What is wrong, my love?                                       MARIANNE                          Nothing! Please do not ask me                           questions!                 MARIANNE struggles free.                                       MARIANNE                          Please let me be!                 She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming.                 There is a moment of stunned silence.                                       ELINOR                          They must have quarreled.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady                           Allen--disapproves of his regard for                           Marianne and has invented an excuse                           to send him away?                                       ELINOR                          Then why did he not say as much? It                           is not like Willoughby to be                           secretive. Did he think Marianne was                           richer than she is?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          How could he?                 She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a                 frown.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          What is it you suspect him of?                                       ELINOR                          I can hardly tell you. But why was                           his manner so guilty?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          What are you saying, Elinor? That he                           has been acting a part to your sister                           for all this time?                 MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think.                                       ELINOR                          No, he loves her, I am sure.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Of course he loves her!                                       ELINOR                          But has he left her with any assurance                           of his return? Cannot you ask her if                           he has proposed?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Certainly not. I cannot force a                           confidence from Marianne and nor                           must you. We must trust her to confide                           in us in her own time.                                       ELINOR                               (shaking her head)                          There was something so underhand in                           the manner of his leaving.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          You are resolved, then, to think the                           worst of him.                                       ELINOR                          Not resolved--                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (cold)                          I prefer to give him the benefit of                           my good opinion. He deserves no less.                           From all of us.                 She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR                 follows her.                                       ELINOR                          Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby--                 MRS DASHWOOD goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. ELINOR                 is halfway up the stairs. She meets a wet-eyed MARGARET coming                 down with a cup of tea.                                       MARGARET                          She would not let me in.                 ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden                 in tears.                 The sound of sobbing also comes from MARIANNE s room, and                 now from MRS DASHWOOD s as well. ELINOR sits down helplessly                 on the stairs and drinks the tea.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - RAIN - DAY                 The rain has settled in. The cottage looks cold and bleak.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY                 BETSY carries another uneaten meal from MARIANNE s room. She                 looks at the food and tuts in anxiety.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - DAY                 MARIANNE is sitting by the window looking out at the rain                 through tear-swollen eyes. WILLOUGHBY s sonnets are on her                 lap.                                       MARIANNE                          How like a winter hath my absence                           been from thee, the pleasure of the                           fleeting year! What freezings have I                           felt, what dark days seen! What old                           December s bareness everywhere!                 EXT. BARTON PARK - RAIN - EVE                 Smoke issues from every chimney in the place.                 INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE                 Dinner is over. MARIANNE sits listlessly by the window. MR                 PALMER is hiding behind a newspaper. SIR JOHN and MARGARET                 are looking at a map and discussing routes through China.                 LUCY, CHARLOTTE, MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS are at cards.                 ELINOR is reading.                                       CHARLOTTE                          Oh! If only this rain would stop!                                       MR PALMER                               (from behind the paper)                          If only you would stop.                 MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE laugh at him.                                       MRS JENNINGS                           Twas you took her off my hands, Mr                           Palmer, and a very good bargain you                           made of it too, but now I have the                           whip hand over you for you cannot                           give her back!                 The heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy                 truth of this statement.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Miss Marianne, come and play a round                           with us! Looking out at the weather                           will not bring him back.                                       CHARLOTTE                               (sotto voce)                          She ate nothing at dinner.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Mind, we are all a little forlorn                           these days. London has swallowed all                           our company.                 CHARLOTTE and MRS JENNINGS start to gossip about the                 disappearances of BRANDON and WILLOUGHBY. LUCY walks over                 and sits by ELINOR, who politely puts aside the book.                                       LUCY                               (low)                          Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we                           might have our--discussion.                                       ELINOR                          Our discussion?                 LUCY looks around at MRS JENNINGS and lowers her voice still                 further, so that ELINOR is obliged to move her chair nearer.                                       LUCY                          There is a particular question I                           have long wanted to ask you, but                           perhaps you will think me impertinent?                                       ELINOR                          I cannot imagine so.                                       LUCY                          But it is an odd question. Forgive                           me, I have no wish to trouble you--                 She looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak.                                       ELINOR                          My dear Miss Steele--                                       CHARLOTTE                               (interrupting)                          Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby                           had gone home to Combe Magna, we                           could have taken Miss Marianne to                           see him! For we live but half a mile                           away.                                       MR PALMER                          Five and a half.                                       CHARLOTTE                          No, I cannot believe it is that far,                           for you can see the place from the                           top of our hill. Is it really five                           and a half miles? No! I cannot believe                           it.                                       MR PALMER                          Try.                                       ELINOR                          You have my permission to ask any                           manner of question, if that is of                           any help.                                       LUCY                          Thank you. I wonder, are you at all                           acquainted with your sister-in-law s                           mother? Mrs Ferrars?                 ELINOR sits back in deep surprise.                                       ELINOR                          With Fanny s mother? No, I have never                           met her.                                       LUCY                          I am sure you think me strange for                           inquiring--if I dared tell--                                       MRS JENNINGS                               (shouting over)                          If she tells you aught of the famous                            Mr F , Lucy, you are to pass it on.                 ELINOR tries to ignore MRS JENNINGS, who is keeping a curious                 eye on them.                                       LUCY                          Will you take a turn with me, Miss                           Dashwood?                 LUCY rises and takes ELINOR s arm. She guides her as far                 away as possible from MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE.                                       ELINOR                          I had no idea at all that you were                           connected with that family.                                       LUCY                          Oh! I am certainly nothing to Mrs                           Ferrars at present--but the time may                           come when we may be very intimately                           connected.                                       ELINOR                               (low)                          What do you mean? Do you have an                           understanding with Fanny s brother                           Robert?                                       LUCY                          The youngest? No, I never saw him in                           my life. No, with Edward.                                       ELINOR                          Edward?                 ELINOR stops walking.                                       ELINOR                          Edward Ferrars?                 LUCY nods.                                       LUCY                          Edward and I have been secretly                           engaged these five years.                 ELINOR is frozen to the spot.                                       LUCY                          You may well be surprised. I should                           never have mentioned it, had I not                           known I could entirely trust you to                           keep our secret. Edward cannot mind                           me telling you for he looks on you                           quite as his own sister.                 ELINOR walks on mechanically. Disbelief has set in.                                       ELINOR                          I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot                           mean the same Mr Ferrars?                                       LUCY                          The very same--he was four years                           under the tutelage of my uncle Mr                           Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never                           spoken of it?                                       ELINOR                               (awareness dawning)                          Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has.                                       LUCY                          I was very unwilling to enter into                           it without his mother s approval but                           we loved each other with too great a                           passion for prudence. Though you do                           nor know him so well as I, Miss                           Dashwood, you must have seen how                           capable he is of making a woman                           sincerely attached to him. I cannot                           pretend it has not been very hard on                           us both. We can hardly meet above                           twice a year.                 She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds                 to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF.                 ELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so                 dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.                                       LUCY                          You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood--                          are you quite well?                                       ELINOR                          Perfectly well, thank you.                                       LUCY                          I have not offended you?                                       ELINOR                          On the contrary.                 MRS JENNINGS has been watching. Now she rises, unable to                 contain herself.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I can stand it no longer, I must                           know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss                           Dashwood is quite engrossed!                 MRS JENNINGS starts to bear down on them. LUCY whispers with                 real urgency.                                       LUCY                          Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds                           out, it will ruin him--you must not                           tell a soul! Edward says you would                           not break your word to save your                           life! Promise me!                 ECU on ELINOR s face.                                       ELINOR                          I give you my word.                 MRS JENNINGS looms over them.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Well, what can have fascinated you                           to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?                                       CHARLOTTE                          Tell us all!                 ELINOR cannot speak but LUCY glides smoothly in.                                       LUCY                          We were talking of London, ma am,                           and all its--diversions.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Do you hear, Charlotte?                 MRS JENNINGS claps her hands delightedly.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          While you were so busy whispering,                           Charlotte and I have concocted a                           plan!                                       CHARLOTTE                          It is the best plan in the world.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I make for London shortly and I invite                           you, Lucy, and both the Misses                           Dashwood to join me!                 ELINOR cannot hide her dismay. MARIANNE springs from her                 seat.                                       MARIANNE                          London!                                       MARGARET                          Oh, can I go! Can I go?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          You know perfectly well you are too                           young, dearest.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I shall convey you all to my house                           in Berkeley Street and we shall taste                           all the delights of the season--what                           say you?                                       MARGARET                          Oh, please can I go? I m twelve soon.                                       CHARLOTTE                          Mr Palmer, do you not long to have                           the Misses Dashwood come to London?                                       MR PALMER                          I came into Devonshire with no other                           view.                 ELINOR exerts herself.                                       ELINOR                          Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but                           we cannot possibly leave our mother...                 LUCY s calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with alacrity.                                       LUCY                          Indeed, the loss would be too great.                 A chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS                 DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE                 with a smile on her face.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Your mother can spare you very well.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Of course I can!                                       CHARLOTTE                          Of course she can!                                       SIR JOHN                          And look at Miss Marianne--it would                           break her heart to deny her!                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I will brook no refusal, Miss                           Dashwood!                 MARIANNE claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. MRS                 JENNINGS takes ELINOR s hand.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Let you and me strike hands upon the                           bargain--and if I do not have the                           three of you married by Christmas,                           it will not be my fault!                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR/MARIANNE S BEDROOM - NIGHT                 We are in ELINOR and MARIANNE s bedroom. ELINOR is in bed.                 She is lying on her side with her back to MARIANNE. We are                 CLOSE on her face. MARIANNE is running around excitedly,                 pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc.                                       MARIANNE                          I was never so grateful in all my                           life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a                           kind woman she is! I like her more                           than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall                           see Willoughby. Think how surprised                           he will be! And you will see Edward!                 ELINOR cannot reply.                                       MARIANNE                          Are you asleep?                                       ELINOR                          With you in the room?                 MARIANNE laughs.                                       MARIANNE                          I do not believe you feel as calm as                           you look, not even you, Elinor. I                           will never sleep tonight! Oh, what                           were you and Miss Steele whispering                           about so long?                 CLOSE on ELINOR s expression as she struggles with the                 impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without                 breaking her promise to LUCY. After a pause--                                       ELINOR                          Nothing of significance.                 MARIANNE looks at ELINOR curiously, then returns to her                 packing.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY                 MRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS s carriage                 off. MARIANNE waves back with such exuberance that she                 practically falls out.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S CARRIAGE - ROAD TO LONDON - DAY                 MRS JENNINGS is chattering about London to MARIANNE, who                 listens with new-found tolerance. LUCY is whispering into                 ELINOR s ear.                                       LUCY                          I have written to Edward, Miss                           Dashwood, and yet I do not know how                           much I may see of him. Secrecy is                           vital--he will never be able to call.                                       ELINOR                          I should imagine not.                                       LUCY                          It is so hard. I believe my only                           comfort has been the constancy of                           his affection.                                       ELINOR                          You are fortunate, over such a lengthy                           engagement, never to have had any                           doubts on that score.                 LUCY looks at ELINOR sharply, but ELINOR is impassive.                                       LUCY                          Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature                           and if he had talked more of one                           young lady than any other... but he                           has never given a moment s alarm on                           that count.                 We can see from ELINOR s expression that she understands                 LUCY perfectly. The strain around her eyes is pronounced.                                       LUCY                          Imagine how glad he will be to learn                           that we are friends!                 EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                 MRS JENNINGS s carriage trundles along.                 EXT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY                 Establishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS s                 carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - HALL - DAY                 They enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of                 a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two                 days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS JENNINGS is all                 officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation.                 She whispers to MRS JENNINGS, who laughs heartily.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          To be sure, my dear, you must just                           hand it to Pigeon there. He will                           take care of it.                 MARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can                 see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE                 inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Lord above, you do not waste any                           time, Miss Marianne!                 MARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS                 JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers.                                       LUCY                          A letter! So they are definitely                           engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister                           will buy her wedding clothes here in                           town.                                       ELINOR                          Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no                           such plan.                 But ELINOR does not know what else to say. She marches firmly                 upstairs.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 MARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes                 and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE                 is pacing up and down in front of the window.                                       ELINOR                          John and Fanny are in town. I think                           we shall be forced to see them.                 There is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps.                                       ELINOR                          I think it was for next door.                 MARIANNE looks out of the window.                                       MARIANNE                          Yes, you are right.                 She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder                 rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling                 downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the                 drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We                 hear a MAN s voice.                                       MARIANNE                          Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed                           it is!                 She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL                 BRANDON.                                       MARIANNE                          Oh! Excuse me, Colonel--                 She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of                 MARIANNE s rudeness that she does not at first notice                 BRANDON s mood of tense distress.                                       ELINOR                          Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to                           see you! Have you been in London all                           this while?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I have. How is your dear mother?                                       ELINOR                          Very well, thank you.                 Silence.                                       ELINOR                          Colonel, is there anything--                 But BRANDON interrupts her.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I                           have heard reports through town...                           is it impossible to--but I could                           have no chance of succeeding--indeed                           I hardly know what to do. Tell me                           once and for all, is everything                           finally resolved between your sister                           and Mr Willoughby?                 ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion.                                       ELINOR                          Colonel, though neither one has                           informed me of their under standing,                           I have no doubt of their mutual                           affection.                 BRANDON stands very still.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your                           sister I wish all imaginable                           happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that                           he... may endeavour to deserve her.                 His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.                                       ELINOR                          What do you mean?                 But he recollects himself.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Forgive me, I--forgive me.                 He bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled.                 EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY                 The PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and                 MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth                 has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts                 as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding                 ELINOR s arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping                 with CHARLOTTE.                 MARIANNE s good looks are heightened by her feverish                 expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many                 young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.                                       MARIANNE                          Where is dear Edward, John? We expect                           to see him daily.                 FANNY stiffens. LUCY s sharp eyes dart hither and thither.                 MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          And who is  dear Edward ?                                       CHARLOTTE                          Who indeed?                 FANNY smiles glacially.                                       FANNY                          My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward                           Ferrars.                 MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?                 She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - HALL - EVE                 MRS JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their                 outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON.                                       MARIANNE                          Are there any messages, Pigeon?                                       PIGEON                          No, ma am.                                       MARIANNE                          No message at all? No cards?                                       PIGEON                               (affronted)                          None, ma am.                 MARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs.                 MRS JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I note you do not inquire for your                           messages, Miss Dashwood!                                       ELINOR                          No, for I do not expect any, Mrs                           Jennings. I have very little                           acquaintance in town.                 And she follows MARIANNE firmly upstairs. LUCY watches her                 go, and MRS JENNINGS chuckles and turns to her.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          She is as sly as you, Lucy!                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                 ELINOR wakes up. The flickering of a candle has disturbed                 her. She sits up in bed and sees MARIANNE sitting at the                 desk in her nightgown, writing another letter.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, is anything wrong?                                       MARIANNE                          Nothing at all. Go back to sleep.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - MORNING ROOM - NIGHT                 MARIANNE, in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces                 restlessly, her letter in her hands. A slight knock at the                 door heralds a much-ruffled PIGEON, wig askew. MARIANNE hands                 him the letter. He bows and goes, highly disgruntled.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - HALL - MORNING                 MRS JENNINGS is giving PIGEON his instructions for the day.                 MARIANNE comes running downstairs. PIGEON regards her drily.                                       PIGEON                          No messages, ma am.                 MARIANNE looks so dejected that MRS JENNINGS takes her hand.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Do not fret, my dear. I am told that                           this good weather is keeping many                           sportsmen in the country at present,                           but the frost will drive them back                           to town very soon, depend upon it.                 MARIANNE brightens.                                       MARIANNE                          Of course! I had not thought of--                          thank you, Mrs Jennings!                 She runs back upstairs. MRS JENNINGS calls after her.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          And Miss Dashwood may set her heart                           at rest, for I overheard your sister-                          in-law say that she was to bring the                           elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!                 EXT. GRAND CRESCENT LEADING TO BALLROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT                 So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the                 GUESTS that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to                 walk to the entrance. We see MRS JENNINGS, MARIANNE, ELINOR                 and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way                 through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles.                 ELINOR nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto LUCY in order                 not to slip into the dirt.                 INT. GRAND BALLROOM - EVE                 The great ballroom is crammed with GUESTS all determined to                 enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences                 caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. MEN are sweating                 profusely, WOMEN dab their brows, rack punch is being                 swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch                 and all conversation is inordinately loud. Only the DANCERS                 have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing                 steps. MRS JENNINGS and her brood bump into the PALMERS.                                       CHARLOTTE                               (screeching)                          This is very merry!                 MRS JENNINGS then spots FANNY, who is conducting a desultory                 conversation with an overpowdered ACQUAINTANCE. She drags                 ELINOR, MARIANNE and LUCY over to her.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          There you are! Goodness, how hot it                           is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone,                           I trust?                                       FANNY                          Indeed not. John is just gone to                           fetch my brother--he has been eating                           ices.                 LUCY clutches at ELINOR s sleeve.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Your brother! I declare, that is                           good news indeed. At long last!                 And she beams her approval upon ELINOR.                                       LUCY                               (whispering)                          Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall                           faint clean away.                 FANNY has seen JOHN threading his way towards them and waves                 at him. There is someone behind him. LUCY preens. JOHN bows                 to them.                                       JOHN                          Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother-                          in-law?                 He turns to reveal a good-looking young MAN with a vacuous                 smile.                                       JOHN                          Mr Robert Ferrars!                                       ROBERT                          My dear ladies--we meet at last!                 There is a general bowing and shaking of hands. ELINOR is                 relieved. LUCY drops a low curtsy.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          So you must be the younger brother?                           Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood                           here was counting on him!                 ROBERT looks ELINOR up and down. He exchanges glances with                 FANNY before he speaks.                                       ROBERT                          Oh! He is far too busy for such                           gatherings--and has no special                           acquaintance here to make his                           attendance worthwhile.                 MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in puzzlement.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Well, I declare, I do not know what                           the young men are about these days--                          are they all in hiding?                 ELINOR looks down, agonised with embarrassment.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of                           your brother, you must dance with                           our lovely Miss Dashwood!                                       ROBERT                               (not best pleased)                          It would be my honour.                 He turns to LUCY and bows.                                       ROBERT                          And perhaps Miss Steele might consider                           reserving the allemande?                 LUCY curtsies again. ROBERT escorts a most unwilling ELINOR                 onto the dance floor.                                       ROBERT                          You reside in Devonshire, I b lieve,                           Miss Dashwood?                                       ELINOR                          We do.                                       ROBERT                          In a cottage?                                       ELINOR                          Yes.                                       ROBERT                          I am excessively fond of a cottage.                           If I had any money to spare, I should                           build one myself.                 Luckily for ELINOR the set changes and she is obliged to                 turn away from ROBERT. She wheels round to face her new                 partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare                 at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced                 to take hands and resume the steps.                                       WILLOUGHBY                               (stiff)                          How do you do, Miss Dashwood?                 ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.                                       ELINOR                          I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.                 She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep                 her away from WILLOUGHBY.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          How is your--family?                                       ELINOR                               (cold)                          We are all extremely well, Mr                           Willoughby--thank you for your kind                           inquiry.                 WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At                 the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the                 brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across                 the room.                                       MARIANNE                          Willoughby!                 Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with                 both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the                 noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their                 partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching.                 MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms                 frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.                                       MARIANNE                          Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor                           shake hands with me?                 WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards                 a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely.                 Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at                 him proprietorially.                 WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE s hand briefly. Behind her, MRS                 JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN,                 while LUCY whispers in ROBERT s ear as they go past to join                 the set.                                       WILLOUGHBY                               (strangled)                          How do you do, Miss Marianne?                                       MARIANNE                          Willoughby, what is the matter? Why                           have you not come to see me? Were                           you not in London? Have you nor                           received my letters?                 WILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension.                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving                           the information which you were so                           good as to send me.                                       MARIANNE                               (piteously)                          For heaven s sake, Willoughby, tell                           me what is wrong!                                       WILLOUGHBY                          Thank you--I am most obliged. If you                           will excuse me, I must return to my                           party.                 He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the                 SOPHISTICATED WOMAN.                                       MARIANNE                          Willoughby!                 He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at                 MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension.                 MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne! Come away!                                       MARIANNE                          Go to him, Elinor--force him to come                           to me.                 MRS JENNINGS has come up, full of concern.                                       ELINOR                          Dearest, do not betray what you feel                           to everyone present! This is not the                           place for explanations--                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Come along, dear.                 They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns                 back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically                 imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as                 much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing                 nearby.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Will you come, Lucy?                                       LUCY                          Oh, are we leaving so soon?                                       ROBERT                          If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings,                           it would be our pleasure to escort                           your young charge home.                                       LUCY                          How very kind!                                       MRS JENNINGS                          That is very handsome--                 She rushes off to follow MARIANNE and ELINOR. We stay for a                 moment with LUCY and ROBERT who have left the set.                                       ROBERT                          She actually sent him messages during                           the night?                 CAM rises to show the DASHWOODS exiting past the whispering,                 sneering faces of the CROWD.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                 MARIANNE sits scribbling a letter at the desk.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, please tell me--                                       MARIANNE                          Do not ask me questions!                                       ELINOR                          You have no confidence in me.                                       MARIANNE                          This reproach from you! You, who                           confide in no one.                                       ELINOR                          I have nothing to tell.                                       MARIANNE                          Nor I. We have neither of us anything                           to tell. I because I conceal nothing                           and you because you communicate                           nothing.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY                 A silent breakfast. MARIANNE is red-eyed from crying and                 limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out,                 pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters                 with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She                 seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          There now! Lovers  quarrels are swift                           to heal! That letter will do the                           trick, mark my word.                 She goes to the door.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I must be off. I hope he won t keep                           her waiting much longer, Miss                           Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking                           so forlorn.                 She leaves and ELINOR finds herself alone with LUCY, who                 loses no time in sharing her new-found happiness.                                       LUCY                          What a welcome I had from Edward s                           family, Miss Dashwood--I am surprised                           you never told me what an agreeable                           woman your sister-in-law is! And Mr                           Robert--all so affable!                                       ELINOR                          It is perhaps fortunate that none of                           them knows of your engagement. Excuse                           me.                 ELINOR rises and leaves.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                 ELINOR finds MARIANNE sitting on the edge of the bed. She                 does not acknowledge ELINOR but merely lifts the letter and                 reads out, with deadly calm:                                       MARIANNE                           My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss                           to discover in what point I could be                           so unfortunate as to offend you. My                           esteem for your family is very sincere                           but if I have given rise to a belief                           of more than I felt or meant to                           express, I shall reproach myself for                           not having been more guarded. My                           affections have long been engaged                           elsewhere and it is with great regret                           that I return your letters and the                           lock of hair which you so obligingly                           bestowed upon me. I am etc. John                           Willoughby.                                        ELINOR                          Oh, Marianne.                 MARIANNE gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across                 the bed as though in physical agony.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better                           to know at once what his intentions                           are. Dearest, think of what you would                           have felt if your engagement had                           carried on for months and months                           before he chose to put an end to it.                                       MARIANNE                          We are not engaged.                                       ELINOR                          But you wrote to him! I thought then                           that he must have left you with some                           kind of understanding?                                       MARIANNE                          No--he is not so unworthy as you                           think him.                                       ELINOR                          Not so unworthy! Did he tell you                           that he loved you?                                       MARIANNE                          Yes. No--never absolutely. It was                           every day implied, but never declared.                           Sometimes I thought it had been, but                           it never was. He has broken no vow.                                       ELINOR                          He has broken faith with all of us,                           he made us all believe he loved you.                                       MARIANNE                          He did! He did--he loved me as I                           loved him.                 MRS JENNINGS bursts through the door in her hat and coat,                 panting.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          I had to come straight up--how are                           you, Miss Marianne?                 MARIANNE begins to sob uncontrollably.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Poor thing! She looks very bad. No                           wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but                           too true. I was told here in the                           street by Miss Morton, who is a great                           friend: he is to be married at the                           end of the month--to a Miss Grey                           with fifty thousand pounds. Well,                           said I, if  tis true, then he is a                           good-for-nothing who has used my                           young friend abominably ill, and I                           wish with all my soul that his wife                           may plague his heart out!                 She goes round the bed to comfort MARIANNE.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          But he is not the only young man                           worth having, my dear, and with your                           pretty face you will never want for                           admirers.                 MARIANNE sobs even harder.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Ah, me! She had better have her cry                           out and have done with it. I will go                           and look out something to tempt her--                          does she care for olives?                                       ELINOR                          I cannot tell you.                 MRS JENNINGS leaves. MARIANNE seizes the letter again.                                       MARIANNE                          I cannot believe his nature capable                           of such cruelty!                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, there is no excuse for him--                          this is his hand--                                       MARIANNE                          But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma!                           I want Mamma! Elinor, please take me                           home! Cannot we go tomorrow?                                       ELINOR                          There is no one to take us.                                       MARIANNE                          Cannot we hire a carriage?                                       ELINOR                          We have no money--and indeed we owe                           Mrs Jennings more courtesy.                                       MARIANNE                          All she wants is gossip and she only                           likes me because I supply it! Oh,                           God! I cannot endure to stay.                                       ELINOR                          I will find a way. I promise.                 INT. COFFEE-HOUSE - COVENT GARDEN - DAY                 FANNY, JOHN and ROBERT are drinking chocolate together.                                       ROBERT                          Apparently they never were engaged.                                       FANNY                          Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds.                           Marianne is virtually penniless.                                       JOHN                          She cannot have expected him to go                           through with it. But I feel for                           Marianne--she will lose her bloom                           and end a spinster like Elinor. I                           think, my dear, we might consider                           having them to stay with us for a                           few days--we are, after all, family,                           and my father.                 He trails off. FANNY exchanges an alarmed glance with ROBERT.                 She thinks fast.                                       FANNY                          My love, I would ask them with all                           my heart, but I have already asked                           Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot                           deprive Mrs Jennings of all her                           company at once. We can invite your                           sisters some other year, you know,                           and Miss Steele will profit far more                           from your generosity--poor girl!                                       JOHN                          That is very thoughtful, Fanny. We                           shall ask Elinor and Marianne next                           year, then... Certainly!                 EXT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON STREET - DAY                 MRS JENNINGS s carriage stands outside. A livened FOOTMAN                 opens the door and LUCY steps out brandishing a new muff.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                 MARIANNE sits alone on the bed. Around her lie her notes to                 Willoughby, her lock of hair and the pocket sonnets. In her                 hands is the creased and tear-stained letter from Willoughby                 which she is examining over and over.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 ELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter. There is a sudden                 rap at the front door. Footsteps are heard and as she turns,                 the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON. ELINOR rises to greet                 him.                                       ELINOR                          Thank you for coming, Colonel.                 He bows. ELINOR is on edge. BRANDON looks haggard with                 concern.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          How does your sister?                                       ELINOR                          I must get her home as quickly as                           possible. The Palmers can take us as                           far as Cleveland, which is but a day                           from Barton--                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Then permit me to accompany you and                           take you straight on from Cleveland                           to Barton myself.                 ELINOR takes his hands gratefully.                                       ELINOR                          I confess that is precisely what I                           had hoped for. Marianne suffers                           cruelly, and what pains me most is                           how hard she tries to justify Mr                           Willoughby. But you know her                           disposition.                 After a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still                 or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Perhaps I--my regard for you all--                          Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to                           prove it by relating some                           circumstances which nothing but an                           earnest desire of being useful--                                       ELINOR                          You have something to tell me of Mr                           Willoughby.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                               (nods)                          When I quitted Barton last--but I                           must go further back. A short account                           of myself will be necessary. No                           doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has                           apprised you of certain events in my                           past--the sad outcome of my connection                           with a young woman named Eliza.                 ELINOR nods.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          What is not commonly known is that                           twenty years ago, Eliza bore an                           illegitimate child. The father,                           whoever he was, abandoned them.                 This is strong stuff. ELINOR s concern deepens.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          As she lay dying, she begged me to                           look after the child. Eliza died in                           my arms, broken, wasted away--ah!                           Miss Dashwood, such a subject--                          untouched for so many years--it is                           dangerous...                 He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I had failed Eliza in every other                           way--I could not refuse her now. I                           took the child--Beth is her name--                          and placed her with a family where I                           could be sure she would be well looked                           after. I saw her whenever I could. I                           saw that she was headstrong like her                           mother--and, God forgive me, I                           indulged her, I allowed her too much                           freedom. Almost a year ago, she                           disappeared.                                       ELINOR                          Disappeared!                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I instigated a search but for eight                           months I was left to imagine the                           worst. At last, on the day of the                           Delaford picnic, I received the first                           news her. She was with child... and                           the blackguard who had--                 BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR.                                       ELINOR                          Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby?                 BRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Before I could return to confront                           him, Lady Allen learned of his                           behaviour and turned him from the                           house. He beat a hasty retreat to                           London--                                       ELINOR                          Yes! He left us that morning, without                           any explanation!                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.                           He was left with next to nothing,                           and in danger of losing all that                           remained to his debtors--                                       ELINOR                          --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss                           Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.                 BRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless.                                       ELINOR                          Have you seen Mr Willoughby since                           you learned...?                                       BRANDON                               (nodding)                          We met by appointment, he to defend,                           I to punish his conduct.                 ELINOR stares at him, aghast.                                       BRANDON                          We returned unwounded, so the meeting                           never got abroad.                 ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment.                                       ELINOR                          Is Beth still in town?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          She has chosen to go into the country                           for her confinement. Such has been                           the unhappy resemblance between the                           fate of mother and daughter, and so                           imperfectly have I discharged my                           trust.                 A pause.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I would not have burdened you, Miss                           Dashwood, had I not from my heart                           believed it might, in time, lessen                           your sister s regrets.                 BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her                 and speaks with effort.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I have described Mr Willoughby as                           the worst of libertines--but I have                           since learned from Lady Allen that                           he did mean to propose that day.                           Therefore I cannot deny that his                           intentions towards Marianne were                           honourable, and I feel certain he                           would have married her, had it not                           been for--for the money.                 She looks up at BRANDON. Silence.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                 MARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space. ELINOR is                 kneeling by her, holding her hands.                                       ELINOR                          Dearest, was I right to tell you?                                       MARIANNE                          Of course.                                       ELINOR                          Whatever his past actions, whatever                           his present course, at least you may                           be certain that he loved you.                                       MARIANNE                          But not enough. Not enough.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY                 ELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands. Suddenly MRS                 JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Here is someone to cheer you up,                           Miss Dashwood!                 She is followed in by LUCY. MRS JENNINGS leaves, busy as                 ever. LUCY plants an expression of ghastly concern on her                 face.                                       LUCY                          How is your dear sister, Miss                           Dashwood? Poor thing! I must say, I                           do not know what I should do if a                           man treated me with so little respect.                                       ELINOR                          I hope you are enjoying your stay                           with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?                                       LUCY                          I was never so happy in my entire                           life, Miss Dashwood! I do believe                           your sister-in-law has taken quite a                           fancy to me. I had to come and tell                           you--for you cannot imagine what has                           happened!                                       ELINOR                          No, I cannot.                                       LUCY                          Yesterday I was introduced to Edward s                           mother!                                       ELINOR                          Indeed?                                       LUCY                          And she was a vast deal more than                           civil. I have not yet seen Edward                           but now I feel sure to very soon--                 The MAID comes back.                                       MAID                          There s a Mr Edward Ferrars to see                           you, Miss Dashwood.                 There is a tiny frozen silence.                                       ELINOR                          Do ask him to come up.                 ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again.                 EDWARD is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. As LUCY                 is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only ELINOR.                                       EDWARD                          Miss Dashwood, how can I--                 But ELINOR cuts him off.                                       ELINOR                          Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see                           you. You... know Miss Steele, of                           course.                 EDWARD turns slowly and encounters LUCY s glassy smile. He                 all but blanches. Then bows, and clears his throat.                                       EDWARD                          How do you do, Miss Steele.                                       LUCY                          I am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars.                 EDWARD has no notion of what to do or say. He swallows.                                       ELINOR                          Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.                 LUCY s eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his                 feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.                                       LUCY                          You must be surprised to find me                           here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought                           I was at your sister s house.                 This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile                 but his facial muscles won t work. ELINOR decides to fetch                 help.                                       ELINOR                          Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars.                           She would be most disappointed to                           miss you.                 ELINOR goes to the door, thankful to escape, but MARIANNE                 prevents her by walking in at that moment. Despite her                 anguish, she is very pleased to see EDWARD and embraces him                 warmly.                                       MARIANNE                          Edward! I heard your voice! At last                           you have found us!                 EDWARD is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets                 his own confusion.                                       EDWARD                          Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is                           shamefully overdue. You are pale. I                           hope you have not been unwell?                                       MARIANNE                          Oh, don t think of me--Elinor is                           well, you see, that must be enough                           for both of us!                 MARIANNE gestures to ELINOR encouragingly but EDWARD seems                 unable to look at her.                                       EDWARD                          How do you like London, Marianne?                                       MARIANNE                          Not at all. The sight of you is all                           the pleasure it has afforded, is                           that not so, Elinor?                 Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries                 to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE                 puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom                 she glances with a none too friendly air.                                       MARIANNE                          Why have you taken so long to come                           and see us?                                       EDWARD                          I have been much engaged elsewhere.                                       MARIANNE                          Engaged elsewhere! But what was that                           when there were such friends to be                           met?                                       LUCY                          Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think                           young men never honour their                           engagements, little or great.                 ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice                 it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.                                       MARIANNE                          No, indeed--for Edward is the most                           fearful of giving pain and the most                           incapable of being selfish of anyone                           I ever saw.                 EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.                                       MARIANNE                          Edward, will you not sit? Elinor,                           help me to persuade him.                 Now EDWARD can stand it no longer.                                       EDWARD                          Forgive me but I must take my leave--                                       MARIANNE                          But you are only just arrived!                 ELINOR rises, desperate for them both to go.                                       EDWARD                          You must excuse me, I have a                           commission to attend to for Fanny--                 LUCY jumps in like a shot.                                       LUCY                          In that case perhaps you might escort                           me back to your sister s house, Mr                           Ferrars?                 There is an extremely awkward pause.                                       EDWARD                          I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss                           Dashwood, Miss Marianne.                 He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent                 with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD s arm and looks up at him                 proprietorially.                 After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they                 leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.                                       MARIANNE                          Why did you not urge him to stay?                                       ELINOR                          He must have had his reasons for                           going.                                       MARIANNE                          His reason was no doubt your coldness.                           If I were Edward I would assume you                           did not care for me at all.                 EXT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY                 A tranquil afternoon...                 INT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 LUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless                 basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes.                                       LUCY                          Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly                           t other day. When I think of her,                           deserted and abandoned, it frightens                           me to think I shall never marry.                                       FANNY                          Nonsense. You will marry far better                           than either of the Dashwood girls.                                       LUCY                          How can that possibly be?                                       FANNY                          You have ten times their sense and                           looks.                                       LUCY                          But I have no dowry.                                       FANNY                          There are qualities which will always                           make up for that, and you have them                           in abundance. It would not surprise                           me if you were to marry far and away                           beyond your expectations.                                       LUCY                          I wish it might be so. There is a                           young man--                                       FANNY                          Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is                           he of good breeding and fortune?                                       LUCY                          Oh both--but his family would                           certainly oppose the match.                                       FANNY                          Tush! They will allow it as soon as                           they see you, my dear.                                       LUCY                          It is a very great secret. I have                           told no one in the world for fear of                           discovery.                 FANNY looks up, curious to know more.                                       FANNY                          My dear, I am the soul of discretion.                                       LUCY                          If I dared tell...                                       FANNY                          I can assure you I am as silent as                           the grave.                 LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY s ear.                 EXT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - DAY                 We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence.                 Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek.                                       FANNY (V.O.)                          Viper in my bosom!                 EXT. JOHN AND FANNY S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY                 FANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and                 JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and                 falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT s arms.                 ROBERT falls over.                 EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                 MRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will                 carry her.                 EXT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BERKELEY STREET - DAY                 MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                 ELINOR and MARIANNE are packing. Their mood is gloomy and                 uncommunicative. MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room fighting                 for breath.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr                           Edward Ferrars--the very one I used                           to joke you about, Miss Dashwood--                          has been engaged these five years to                           Lucy Steele!                 MARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at                 her in swift confirmation.                                       MRS JENNINGS                          Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by                           all accounts is very proud, demanded                           that he break the engagement on pain                           of disinheritance. But he has refused                           to break his promise to Lucy. He has                           stood by her, good man, and is cut                           off without a penny! She has settled                           it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert.                           But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy.                           Your sister-in-law scolded her like                           any fury--drove her to hysterics.                 She leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence.                                       MARIANNE                          How long have you known?                                       ELINOR                          Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered                           to take us to London.                                       MARIANNE                          Why did you not tell me?                                       ELINOR                          Lucy told me in the strictest                           confidence.                 MARIANNE looks at her in complete incredulity.                                       ELINOR                          I could not break my word.                 Clearly, there is no arguing this point.                                       MARIANNE                          But Edward loves you.                                       ELINOR                          He made me no promises. He tried to                           tell me about Lucy.                                       MARIANNE                          He cannot marry her.                                       ELINOR                          Would you have him treat her even                           worse than Willoughby has treated                           you?                                       MARIANNE                          No--but nor would I have him marry                           where he does not love.                 ELINOR tries hard to be controlled.                                       ELINOR                          Edward made his promise a long time                           ago, long before he met me. Though                           he may... harbour some regret, I                           believe he will be happy--in the                           knowledge that he did his duty and                           kept his word. After all--after all                           that is bewitching in the idea of                           one s happiness depending entirely                           on one person, it is not always                           possible. We must accept. Edward                           will marry Lucy--and you and I will                           go home.                                       MARIANNE                          Always resignation and acceptance!                           Always prudence and honour and duty!                           Elinor, where is your heart?                 ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost                 savagely.                                       ELINOR                          What do you know of my heart? What                           do you know of anything but your own                           suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I                           have had this pressing on me without                           being at liberty to speak of it to a                           single creature. It was forced upon                           me by the very person whose prior                           claims ruined all my hopes. I have                           had to endure her exultation again                           and again while knowing myself to be                           divided from Edward forever. Believe                           me, Marianne, had I not been bound                           to silence I could have produced                           proof enough of a broken heart even                           for you.                 Complete silence. Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper.                                       MARIANNE                          Oh, Elinor!                 MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around ELINOR,                 who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.                 EXT. PALMER RESIDENCE - LONDON STREET - DAY                 LUCY and MRS JENNINGS are on the doorstep. LUCY looks rather                 lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed.                 The door opens and CHARLOTTE precedes the SERVANT, ushering                 them in with shrill cries of sympathy.                                       COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)                          I have heard that your friend Mr                           Ferrars has been entirely cast off                           by his family for persevering in his                           engagement to Miss Steele.                 EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY                 ELINOR and BRANDON walk round the quiet square.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Have I been rightly informed? Is it                           so?                 ELINOR is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query.                                       ELINOR                          It is indeed so. Are you acquainted                           with Mr Ferrars?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          No, we have never met. But I know                           only too well the cruelty--the                           impolitic cruelty of dividing two                           young people long attached to one                           another. Mrs Ferrars does not know                           what she may drive her son to--                 He pauses, frowning in remembrance. ELINOR waits in suspense.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I have a proposal to make that should                           enable him to marry Miss Steele                           immediately. Since the gentleman is                           so close a friend to your family,                           perhaps you will be good enough to                           mention it to him?                 ELINOR is completely taken aback. She takes a moment to reply.                                       ELINOR                          Colonel, I am sure he would be only                           too delighted to hear it from your                           own lips.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          I think not. His behaviour has proved                           him proud--in the best sense. I feel                           certain this is the right course.                 INT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY                 ELINOR is waiting. The MAID announces EDWARD and he walks in                 momentarily. They are alone for the first time in months and                 for a moment, neither speaks.                                       ELINOR                          Mr Ferrars.                                       EDWARD                          Miss Dashwood.                 ELINOR indicates a seat for him but neither sits.                                       ELINOR                          Thank you for responding so promptly                           to my message.                                       EDWARD                          I was most grateful to receive it. I--                          Miss Dashwood, God knows what you                           must think of me...                                       ELINOR                          Mr Ferrars--                 He interrupts her, desperate to explain.                                       EDWARD                          I have no right to speak, I know--                 ELINOR has to stop him.                                       ELINOR                          Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think                           you know of our friend Colonel                           Brandon?                 EDWARD looks completely bewildered.                                       EDWARD                          Yes, I have heard his name.                 ELINOR starts to speak rather faster than usual.                                       ELINOR                          Colonel Brandon desires me to say                           that, understanding you wish to join                           the clergy, he has great pleasure in                           offering you the parish on his estate                           at Delaford, now just vacant, in the                           hope that it may enable you--and                           Miss Steele--to marry.                 EDWARD cannot at first take it in. ELINOR sits down.                                       EDWARD                          Colonel Brandon?                                       ELINOR                          Yes. He means it as testimony of his                           concern for--for the cruel situation                           in which you find yourselves.                 Now EDWARD sits--in shock.                                       EDWARD                          Colonel Brandon give me a parish?                           Can it be possible?                                       ELINOR                          The unkindness of your family has                           made you astonished to find friendship                           elsewhere.                 EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing                 comprehension.                                       EDWARD                          No. Not to find it in you. I cannot                           be ignorant that to you--to your                           goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I                           would express it if I could, but, as                           you know, I am no orator.                                       ELINOR                          You are very much mistaken. I assure                           you that you owe it almost entirely                           to your own merit--I have had no                           hand in it.                 But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the                 offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an                 effort.                                       EDWARD                          Colonel Brandon must be a man of                           great worth and respect ability.                 ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that                 she truly means.                                       ELINOR                          He is the kindest and best of men.                 This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent                 for a moment but then rouses himself to action.                                       EDWARD                          May I enquire why the Colonel did                           not tell me himself?                                       ELINOR                          I think he felt it would be better                           coming from... a friend.                 EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness.                                       EDWARD                          Your friendship has been the most                           important of my life.                                       ELINOR                          You will always have it.                                       EDWARD                          Forgive me.                                       ELINOR                          Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises--                          that is more important than anything                           else. I wish you--both--very happy.                 They rise. She curtsies. He bows.                                       EDWARD                          Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.                 EDWARD leaves silently. ELINOR stands stock-still in the                 middle of the room.                 EXT. MRS JENNINGS S HOUSE - DAY                 The PALMERS  carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL                 BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his                 horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the                 steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose,                 looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes                 back indoors with a sigh.                 INT. THE PALMERS  CARRIAGE - ON THE ROAD - DAY                 MARIANNE is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed.                 She does not look well. MR PALMER is behind his newspaper.                                       CHARLOTTE                          What a stroke of luck for Lucy and                           Edward to find a parish so close to                           Barton! You will all be able to meet                           very often. That will cheer you up,                           Miss Marianne. I do declare I have                           never disliked a person so much as I                           do Mr Willoughby, for your sake.                           Insufferable man! To think we can                           see his insufferable house from the                           top of our hill!                 CLOSE on MARIANNE s eyes slowly opening.                                       CHARLOTTE                          I shall ask Jackson to plant some                           very tall trees.                                       MR PALMER                               (from behind the paper)                          You will do nothing of the sort.                 EXT. THE PALMERS  CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - DAY                 The carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it.                                       CHARLOTTE (V.O.)                          I hear Miss Grey s bridal gown was                           everything of the finest--made in                           Paris, no less. I should have liked                           to see it, although I dare say it                           was a sorry affair, scalloped with                           ruffles--but what do the French know                           about fashion?                 EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - AFTERNOON                 The carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a                 resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is                 helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage.                                       CHARLOTTE (V.O.)                          I am resolved never to mention Mr                           Willoughby s name again, and                           furthermore I shall tell everyone I                           meet what a good-for nothing he is.                                       MR PALMER (V.O.)                          Be quiet.                 ELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch                 from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS.                                       ELINOR                               (sotto voce)                          I do not think she drew breath from                           the moment we left London. It is my                           fault--I should have found some other                           way of getting home.                                       MARIANNE                          There was no other way you said so                           yourself.                                       ELINOR                          We shall be home soon enough. Mamma                           will comfort you, dearest.                                       MARIANNE                          I am stiff from sitting so long.                           Will you tell Charlotte that I am                           going for a stroll? ELINOR glances                           at the sky in concern.                                       ELINOR                          I think it is going to rain.                                       MARIANNE                          No, no, it will not rain.                 ELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old                 MARIANNE.                                       ELINOR                          You always say that and then it always                           does.                                       MARIANNE                          I will keep to the garden, near the                           house.                 MARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 MRS BUNTING, a rather baleful NANNY, looks on as MR PALMER                 holds up a screaming BABY in a frilly bonnet for everyone s                 inspection.                                       CHARLOTTE                          We are very proud of our little                           Thomas, Colonel--and his papa has                           such a way with him...                 BRANDON flicks a glance at MR PALMER for whom holding a baby                 comes as naturally as breathing underwater.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY                 MARIANNE walks purposefully towards the garden wall, beyond                 which lies a hill.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 ELINOR enters to find CHARLOTTE alone with the now hysterical                 BABY THOMAS.                                       CHARLOTTE                          There you are, Miss Dashwood! Mr                           Palmer and the Colonel have locked                           themselves up in the billiard room.                           Come and meet little Thomas. Where                           is Miss Marianne?                                       ELINOR                          She is taking a little air in the                           garden.                                       CHARLOTTE                          Oh, very good. That is the great                           advantage of the countryside--all                           the fresh air and... and all the                           fresh air...                 CHARLOTTE s conversational difficulties are drowned out by                 her offspring.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY                 MARIANNE comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle.                 It opens. She throws a glance back to the house and passes                 through. There is a low rumble of thunder.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 BABY THOMAS is purple in the face but shows no signs of                 quietening.                 CHARLOTTE joggles him about inefficiently.                                       CHARLOTTE                               (yelling)                          He is the best child in the world--                          he never cries unless he wants to                           and then, Lord, there is no stopping                           him.                 EXT. THE HILL - DAY                 MARIANNE, calm and determined, walks towards the top of the                 hill. The wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 ELINOR, traumatised by her new acquaintance with the shrieking                 BABY THOMAS, goes to look out of the window. She frowns.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY                 ELINOR s POV. MARIANNE is nowhere in sight. Storm clouds                 have gathered on the bill.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 ELINOR turns from the window. BABY THOMAS stops crying for                 two seconds.                                       ELINOR                          I cannot see Marianne.                 There is a crack of thunder. BABY THOMAS starts again.                 EXT. THE HILL - DAY                 Rain has started to pour down. MARIANNE walks on regardless.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 CHARLOTTE shouts over BABY THOMAS to ELINOR.                                       CHARLOTTE                          She has probably taken shelter in                           one of the greenhouses!                 EXT. THE HILL - DAY                 MARIANNE has reached the top. Soaked to the skin, she stands                 with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of                 Combe Magna, the place that would have been her home. Rain                 streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her.                 Through frozen lips she whispers:                                       MARIANNE                          Love is not love Which alters when                           it alteration finds Or bends with                           the remover to remove: 0, no! it is                           an ever-fixed mark That looks on                           tempests and is never shaken...                 EXT. CLEVELAND - GREENHOUSES - DAY                 BRANDON is looking for MARIANNE. He enters a greenhouse.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Marianne!                 EXT. THE HILL - DAY                 MARIANNE stares at Combe Magna, a strange smile playing about                 her lips. Then she calls to WILLOUGHBY as though he were                 near. The effect is eerie, unworldly.                                       MARIANNE                          Willoughby... Willoughby...                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 CHARLOTTE, MR PALMER and ELINOR are waiting anxiously. BABY                 THOMAS has been removed. ELINOR is staring out of the window.                                       CHARLOTTE                          One thing is certain--she will be                           wet through when she returns.                                       MR PALMER                          Thank you for pointing that out, my                           dear. Do not worry, Miss Dashwood--                          Brandon will find her. I think we                           can all guess where she went.                 EXT. THE HILL - DAY                 BRANDON runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his                 heels.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 CHARLOTTE is handing ELINOR a cup of tea. ELINOR turns back                 to look out of the window. She freezes.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY                 ELINOR s POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE                 cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby s ghost.                 INT. CLEVELAND - HALL - DAY                 Everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the COLONEL enters                 with MARIANNE. He is exhausted and soaked. MARIANNE is dumb                 with cold and fatigue.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          She is not hurt--but we must get her                           warm!                 ELINOR and MR PALMER take MARIANNE from BRANDON and go                 upstairs, with CHARLOTTE in pursuit.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT - RAIN                 The great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding.                 INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT                 ELINOR is in her nightgown, knocking at a door. MR PALMER                 answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned                 out of bed.                                       ELINOR                          I think Marianne may need a doctor.                 INT. CLEVELAND - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY                 MR PALMER and CHARLOTTE are sitting at the breakfast table.                 BRANDON is pacing. The rain has stopped.                                       CHARLOTTE                          You ll wear yourself out, Colonel!                           Do not worry! A day or two in bed                           will soon set her to rights!                                       MR PALMER                          You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I                           have never found a better physician.                 Enter ELINOR with DR HARRIS.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                               (urgent)                          What is your diagnosis?                                       DR HARRIS                          It is an infectious fever that has                           taken far more serious hold than I                           would have expected in one so young.                           I would recommend the hasty removal                           of your child, Mr Palmer--                 CHARLOTTE runs out of the room screaming.                                       CHARLOTTE                          Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting!                 EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - DAY                 CHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING                 and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He                 takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy.                                       MR PALMER                          My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more                           sorry than I can say. If you would                           prefer me to stay I am at your                           service.                 ELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty                 exterior.                                       ELINOR                          Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But                           Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will                           look after us. Thank you for                           everything you have done.                 MR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps                 to the carriage.                 INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                 BRANDON sits head in hands. His ghosts have come to haunt                 him.                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - DAY                 MARIANNE is tossing and turning in the bed. DR HARRIS is                 trying to take her pulse. He looks up at ELINOR, who is                 watching anxiously.                                       DR HARRIS                          She is not doing as well as I would                           like.                 INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY                 ELINOR exits the bedroom to find BRANDON outside. She jumps.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          What can I do?                                       ELINOR                          Colonel, you have done so much                           already.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood,                           or I shall run mad. He is dangerously                           quiet.                                       ELINOR                          She would be easier if her mother                           were here.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Of course. Barton is but eight hours                           away. If I make no stop, you may see                           us early tomorrow morning.                 He takes ELINOR s hand and kisses it.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          In your hands I know she will be                           safe.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - EVE                 BRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a                 moment, and then spurs it violently forward.                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - EVE                 ELINOR is by the window, having watched BRANDON s departure.                 DR HARRIS is by MARIANNE s side. He turns to ELINOR.                                       DR HARRIS                          Double the number of drops and I                           will return as soon as I can.                 EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT                 The house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light                 issuing from one of the upper rooms.                 EXT. OPEN ROAD - NIGHT                 BRANDON riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him.                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - NIGHT                 MARIANNE s eyes glitter with the fever. ELINOR wipes her                 brow. Suddenly she speaks.                                       MARIANNE                          Who is that?                 She is looking at the end of the bed.                                       MARIANNE                          Look, look, Elinor.                                       ELINOR                          There is no one there, dearest.                                       MARIANNE                          It is Papa. Papa has come.                 ELINOR looks fearfully towards the end of the bed. MARIANNE                 tries to smile with her cracked lips.                                       MARIANNE                          Dearest Papa!                 The dead are coming for the dying.                                                                    DISSOLVE:                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - LATER                 ELINOR, her eyes red from watching, wipes MARIANNE s temples.                 DR HARRIS takes her pulse and looks at ELINOR anxiously. His                 silence is worse than any utterance.                                                                    DISSOLVE:                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - LATER                 The room is very still. MARIANNE is pale as wax. DR HARRIS                 puts on his coat. ELINOR looks at him fearfully.                                       DR HARRIS                          I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot                           pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your                           sister s condition is not very                           serious. You must prepare yourself.                           I will return very shortly.                 He leaves the room.                                                                    DISSOLVE:                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - LATER                 MARIANNE lies in the grip of her fever. ELINOR sits watching                 her. Slowly she rises and walks to the bed. When she speaks,                 her tone is very practical.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, Marianne, please try--                 Suddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry                 sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak                 and all the more painful for being tearless.                                       ELINOR                          Marianne, please try--I cannot--I                           cannot do without you. Oh, please, I                           have tried to bear everything else--                          I will try--but please, dearest,                           beloved Marianne, do not leave me                           alone.                 She falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking                 MARIANNE s hand and kissing it again and again.                                                                    DISSOLVE:                 EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDENS - DAWN                 A shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon.                 Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song.                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - MORNING                 DR HARRIS sits slumped in a chair. MARIANNE lies motionless.                 ELINOR rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to                 the window. She is white as paper. The lark sings. Then,                 from behind, comes the faintest of whispers.                                       MARIANNE (V.O.)                          Elinor?                 ELINOR turns with a cry. DR HARRIS springs from his seat and                 examines MARIANNE. He then turns to ELINOR with a smile of                 relief and nods. At that moment the sound of carriage wheels                 is heard on the gravel.                                       ELINOR                          My mother!                 EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - MORNING                 BRANDON helps MRS DASHWOOD, who is weak with exhaustion and                 distress, out of the carriage.                 INT. CLEVELAND - STAIRCASE - MORNING                 ELINOR hurls herself down the stairs. She reaches the door                 just as BRANDON and MRS DASHWOOD enter and practically swoons                 into her mother s arms.                                       ELINOR                          Mamma! She is out of danger!                 INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE S BEDROOM - MORNING                 CLOSE on MARIANNE s face as MRS DASHWOOD kisses her.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          There, there, my love, my Marianne.                 MARIANNE opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. MRS DASHWOOD                 takes her gently into her arms. MARIANNE suddenly looks                 anxious. She is too weak to move her head. She whispers with                 urgent effort.                                       MARIANNE                          Where is Elinor?                                       ELINOR                          I am here, dearest, I am here.                 MARIANNE looks at her with deep relief. Behind the DASHWOODS,                 BRANDON stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this                 intimacy. He wipes his eyes and turns away. MARIANNE sees                 and whispers to him.                                       MARIANNE                          Colonel Brandon.                 BRANDON turns back, his eyes full of tears. MARIANNE looks                 at him for a moment. Then, very quietly:                                       MARIANNE                          Thank you.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN AND SURROUNDINGS - DAY                 The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of                 rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden.                 It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging                 and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house.                                       COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)                          What though the sea with waves                           continuall Doe eate the earth, it is                           no more at all.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 MARIANNE is on the sofa by the window. She is pale,                 convalescent and calm. Different somehow. She listens intently                 as BRANDON reads her the poem.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth                           aught. For whatsoever from one place                           doth fall, Is with the tide unto                           another brought...                 We move back to find MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR at the other                 end of the room, sewing peacefully.                                       MRS. DASHWOOD                          He certainly is nor so dashing as                           Willoughby but he has a far more                           pleasing countenance. There was always                           a something, if you remember, in                           Willoughby s eyes at times which I                           did not like.                 ELINOR listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. We                 cut back to BRANDON as he finishes reading.                                       COLONEL BRANDON                           For there is nothing lost, but may                           be found, if sought...                 He looks up at MARIANNE. A soul-breathing glance. She smiles                 as he closes the book.                                       MARIANNE                          Shall we continue tomorrow?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                          No--for I must away.                                       MARIANNE                          Away? Where?                                       COLONEL BRANDON                               (teasing)                          That I cannot tell you. It is a                           secret.                 He rises to leave.                                       MARIANNE                               (impulsive)                          But you will not stay away long?                 CLOSE on BRANDON s reaction.                 EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 ELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly,                 MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR s arm. Their mood is loving,                 companion able.                 EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 ELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops.                                       MARIANNE                          There.                 She indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing                 and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and                 breathes in deeply.                                       MARIANNE                          There I fell, and there I first saw                           Willoughby.                                       ELINOR                          Poor Willoughby. He will always regret                           you.                                       MARIANNE                          But does it follow that, had he chosen                           me, he would have been content?                 ELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised.                                       MARIANNE                          He would have had a wife he loved                           but no money--and might soon have                           learned to rank the demands of his                           pocket-book far above the demands of                           his heart.                 ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly.                                       MARIANNE                          If his present regrets are half as                           painful as mine, he will suffer                           enough.                                       ELINOR                          Do you compare your conduct with                           his?                                       MARIANNE                          No. I compare it with what it ought                           to have been. I compare it with yours.                                       ELINOR                          Our situations were very different.                                       MARIANNE                          My illness has made me consider the                           past. I saw in my own behaviour                           nothing but imprudence--and worse. I                           was insolent and unjust to everyone--                 ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues.                                       MARIANNE                          --but you--you I wronged above all.                           Only I knew your heart and its sorrows                           but even then I was never a grain                           more compassionate. I brought my                           illness upon myself--I wanted to                           destroy myself. And had I succeeded,                           what misery should I have caused                           you?                 ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one                 another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away                 and speaks with great good humour and energy.                                       MARIANNE                          I shall mend my ways! I shall no                           longer worry others nor torture                           myself. I am determined to enter on                           a course of serious study---Colonel                           Brandon has promised me the run of                           his library and I shall read at least                           six hours a day. By the end of the                           year I expect to have improved my                           learning a very great deal.                 EXT. ROAD NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY                 THOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a                 basket of food.                 He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to                 the DRIVER.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 CLOSE on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out                 sums. Pull up to reveal MARIANNE labouring over it. Her                 sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a                 pince-nez that makes her look like an owl.                 ELINOR is sewing and MRS DASHWOOD is snoozing. MARGARET goes                 up and looks over MARIANNE s shoulder. She frowns at the                 spider s web of ink.                                       MARGARET                          You ll go blind if you re not careful.                 BETSY brings in coals for the fire. MRS DASHWOOD rouses                 herself.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Is Thomas back from Exeter, Betsy?                                       BETSY                          Yes, ma am--he brung back two lovely                           fillets for you.                 MRS DASHWOOD looks nervously at ELINOR like a child who has                 been caught out.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Beef is far less expensive in Exeter,                           and anyway they are for Marianne.                 ELINOR laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven. BETSY turns on                 her way out to remark:                                       BETSY                          Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood. Oh,                           and he says Mr Ferrars is married,                           but I suppose you know that, ma am.                 There is a stunned silence. Everyone looks at ELINOR.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy.                 BETSY leaves. They all sit very still. MARGARET is about to                 talk to ELINOR about it but MARIANNE stops her. THOMAS enters.                                       THOMAS                          Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they                           was the cheapest in the market--                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          It was a very good price, Thomas,                           well done. Would you be so kind as                           to build up the fire a little?                                       THOMAS                               (relieved)                          Yes, ma am.                 There is a pause.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Who told you that Mr Ferrars was                           married, Thomas?                 THOMAS builds up the fire as he answers. He tells the story                 with pleasure.                                       THOMAS                          I seen him myself, ma am, and his                           lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was--                          they were stopping in a chaise at                           the New London Inn. I happened to                           look up as I passed the chaise and I                           see it was Miss Steele. So I took                           off my hat and she inquired after                           you, ma am, and all the young ladies,                           especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me                           I should give you her and Mr Ferrars s                           best compliments and service and how                           they d be sure to send you a piece                           of the cake.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with                           her?                                       THOMAS                          Yes, ma am--I just seen him leaning                           back in it, but he did not look up.                 ELINOR screws up her courage.                                       ELINOR                          Did--                 But she cannot continue. MARIANNE glances at her                 compassionately and takes over.                                       MARIANNE                          Did Mrs Ferrars seem well?                                       THOMAS                          Yes, Miss Marianne--she said how she                           was vastly contented and, since she                           was always a very affable young lady,                           I made free to wish her joy.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Thank you, Thomas.                 He nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere. ELINOR                 sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - EVE                 ELINOR is standing by the gate, looking out. MRS DASHWOOD                 comes down the path to join her. She links arms with ELINOR                 and they stand in silence for a beat.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Your father once told me not to allow                           you to neglect yourself. Now I find                           that it is I who have neglected you                           most.                                       ELINOR                          No, Mamma.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne                           is right.                                       ELINOR                          I am very good at hiding.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Then we must observe you more closely.                 A pause.                                       ELINOR                          Mamma?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Yes, my darling?                                       ELINOR                          There is a painful difference between                           the expectation of an unpleasant                           event and its final certainty.                 MRS DASHWOOD squeezes ELINOR s arm tightly.                 EXT. OPEN ROAD NEAR BARTON - DAY                 A horse and cart are jogging along. The cart contains a large                 object tied down and covered with canvas. The DRIVER whistles                 tunelessly.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN - DAY                 MARGARET is standing on the kitchen table while ELINOR and                 MARIANNE pin a piece of material around the bottom of her                 skirt to lengthen it.                 Suddenly there is a commotion upstairs.                                       MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)                          Marianne! Marianne! Come and see                           what is coming!                 Everyone runs out of the kitchen.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY                 THOMAS and the CARTER are carrying a small piano up the path.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 They carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS                  joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads                 out the letter that has accompanied it.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                           At last I have found a small enough                           instrument to fir the parlour. I                           expect to follow it in a day or two,                           by which time I expect you to have                           learned the enclosed. Your devoted                           friend, Christopher Brandon.                  MRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song.                                       MARGARET                          He must like you very much, Marianne.                                       MARIANNE                          It is not just for me! It is for all                           of us.                 All the same, she looks conscious of the truth.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY                 MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD                 is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET s dress and                 listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is                 singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises,                 shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate,                 looking out.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne!                 The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at                 the gate to watch for the rider.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY                 Their POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY                                       ELINOR                          I do not think it is the Colonel.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          It must be. He said he would arrive                           today. You must play him the new                           song, Marianne.                 Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET s tree.                                       MARGARET                          Edward!                 MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the                 grass.                                       MARGARET                          It is Edward!                 The women look at each other in complete consternation.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Calm. We must be calm.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 Tense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves.                 BETSY enters.                                       BETSY                          Mr Ferrars for you, ma am.                 EDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (rising)                          Edward! What a pleasure to see you.                                       EDWARD                          Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret.                           Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all                           well.                 He bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who                 is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious.                                       MARIANNE                          Thank you, Edward, we are all very                           well.                 There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate                 remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite                 conversation.                                       MARGARET                          We have been enjoying very fine                           weather.                 MARIANNE looks at her incredulously.                                       MARGARET                          Well, we have.                                       EDWARD                          I am glad of it. The... the roads                           were very dry.                 MRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (giving him her hand)                          May I wish you great joy, Edward.                 He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer                 of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help.                                       MARIANNE                          I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars                           well?                                       EDWARD                          Tolerably, thank you.                 There is another bone-crunching pause.                                       EDWARD                          I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find                           any words.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish?                 EDWARD looks extremely confused.                                       EDWARD                          No--my mother is in town.                 He plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is                 evidently not much comforted by what he sees.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward                           Ferrars.                 EDWARD colours. He hesitates.                                       EDWARD                          Then you have not heard--the news--I                           think you mean my brother--you mean                           Mrs Robert Ferrars.                 They all stare at him in shock.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Mrs Robert Ferrars?                 ELINOR has frozen. EDWARD rises and goes to the window.                                       EDWARD                          Yes. I received a letter from Miss                           Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say--                          communicating the... the transfer of                           her affections to my brother Robert.                           They were much thrown together in                           London, I believe, and... and in                           view of the change in my                           circumstances, I felt it only fair                           that Miss Steele be released from                           our engagement. At any rate, they                           were married last week and are now                           in Plymouth.                 ELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking                 at one another.                                       ELINOR                          Then you--are not married.                                       EDWARD                          No.                 ELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional                 explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes                 an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET s hand                 and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY                 The three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands.                 INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY                 ELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly.                                       EDWARD                          Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very                           young. Had I had an active profession,                           I should never have felt such an                           idle, foolish inclination. At Norland                           my behaviour was very wrong. But I                           convinced myself you felt only                           friendship for me and it was my heart                           alone that I was risking. I have                           come with no expectations. Only to                           profess, now that I am at liberty to                           do so, that my heart is and always                           will be yours.                 ELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released                 emotion, of pain and of happiness.                 EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN                 MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden                 trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house.                 The branches rustle.                                       MARGARET                          He s sitting next to her!                                       MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE                          Margaret, come down!/Is he?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                               (scolding)                          Margaret! Will you stop--                                       MARIANNE                          What s happening now?                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Marianne!                                       MARGARET (V.O.)                          He s kneeling down!                 MRS DASHWOOD can t help herself.                                       MRS DASHWOOD                          Oh! Is he? Oh!                 She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully.                 EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON - DAY                 The figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in                 deep conversation.                 EXT. PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSK                 Later. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching,                 their words low and intimate.                                       ELINOR                          Your mother, I suppose, will hardly                           be less angry with Robert for marrying                           Lucy.                                       EDWARD                          The more so since she settled the                           money upon him so irrevocably--                                       ELINOR                          --no doubt because she had run out                           of sons to disinherit.                                       EDWARD                          Her family fluctuates at an alarming                           rate. Then, in London, when you told                           me of the Colonel s offer, I became                           convinced that you wanted me to marry                           Lucy and that--well, that you and                           Colonel Brandon...                                       ELINOR                          Me and Colonel Brandon!                                       EDWARD                          I shall not forget attempting to                           thank him for making it possible for                           me to marry the woman I did not love                           while convinced he had designs upon                           the woman I did--do--love.                 EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can                 stand it no longer.                                       EDWARD                          Would you--can you--excuse me--                 He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.                 EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY                 A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards                 the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.                 EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY                 A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The                 entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS,                 SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in                 a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN,                 MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed                 in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in                 regimental uniform.                 The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and                 everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start                 to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and                 BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.                 The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and                 COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in                 his parson s garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.                 CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE                 and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their                 flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage                 decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON                 lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he                 radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely                 happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her                 seem much older.                 According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large                 handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN                 jump and dive for them.                 The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One                 hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards                 into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession                 makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into                 the surrounding countryside.                 Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN                 sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we                 draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around                 and moves off in the opposite direction.                                           THE END ',\n",

PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND                 LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON                 The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their                 way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed                 drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints;                 and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing                 them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints                 RAISES SLOWLY TO:                 EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON                 We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along --                 heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house                 with its outlying barn and corrals.                 EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                 The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is                 ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing.                 Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard.                 Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his                 clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one                 pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows.                 His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down                 the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the                 Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries                 a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho...                 Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and                 PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto                 his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk                 sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer                 to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing                 around the corner of the house.                 EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE -                 LATE AFTERNOON                 She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s.                 Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly.                 DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the                 neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a                 piquant, memorable face.                 EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE                 Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her                 face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again                 five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps                 the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of                 scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.                 EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON                 The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and                 cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch                 extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the                 door, attracted by the dog s barking -- and then he, too,                 sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious                 but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and                 tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man                 than Ethan and possibly a few years older.                 As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter,                 LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 --                 a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl                 with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely                 forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger.                 In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto                 the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years                 have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work                 has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be                 idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares                 the family s interest in the approaching horseman, she                 automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and                 she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.                 EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON                 Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a                 man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He,                 too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much                 so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to                 dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always                 riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward                 the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben,                 MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open                 ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a                 lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight                 hair and a white man s eyes. He is carrying bridle or other                 horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if                 they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues,                 followed by Ben, toward where                 Debbie crouches over her dog.                 EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN - LATE AFTERNOON                 As he rides downslope toward the house.                 THE CREDITS END.                 EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND                 AARON - LATE AFTERNOON                 Suddenly, Martha s eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron --                 recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to                 check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later                 Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.                                       AARON                               (incredulous)                          Ethan?                 He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the                 hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows                 Aaron.                 EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP                 as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them.                  There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally:                                       ETHAN                          Hello, Aaron...                 His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has                 been, in love with his brother s wife and she with him.                                       ETHAN                          Martha...                                       MARTHA                               (a bit shakily)                          Hello, Ethan.                 Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and                 Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron                 pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse                 toward their side.                                       AARON                          How s California?                                       ETHAN                          How should I know?                                       AARON                          But Mose Harper said...                                       ETHAN                          That old goat still creakin                            around?... Whyn t someone bury him?                 He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie                 have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious.                 Debbie s dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down                 at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.                                       ETHAN                          Ben, ain t you?                 Ben nods.                                       ETHAN                               (frowning at Debbie)                          Lucy, you ain t much bigger than                           when I saw you last.                                       DEBBIE                          I m Deborah!                               (pointing)                          She s Lucy.                 Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger.                 EXT. YARD - ANOTHER ANGLE                 as Lucy steps down from the porch and approaches.                                       MARTHA                          Lucy s going on seventeen now...                                       BEN                          An  she s got a beau! Kisses him,                           too!                                       MARTHA                          That s enough... Go on inside and                           help Lucy set the table... You, too,                           Deborah!                 EXT. YARD - FULL SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE                 as Martin -- with slightly averted face -- crosses to take                 the bridle of Ethan s horse and lead him away.                                       ETHAN                               (wheeling on him)                          MOMENTO!                 Martin checks his stride, stares in surprise.                                       MARTHA                               (contritely)                          Martin!... Here we ve been standing...                           Ethan, you haven t forgotten Martin?                                       ETHAN                          Oh... Mistook you for a half-breed.                                       MARTIN                               (levelly)                          Not quite... Quarter Cherokee. The                           rest is Welsh... So they tell me.                                       ETHAN                          You ve done a lot of growin ...                                       AARON                          It was Ethan found you squallin  in                           a sage clump after your folks was                           massacred...                                       ETHAN                               (bluntly)                          It just happened to be me... No need                           to make any more of it...                                       MARTIN                          I ll take care of your horse for                           you, Uncle Ethan.                 Again, he starts to lead away.                                       ETHAN                          Hold on!                 Martin stops again.                                       ETHAN                          I ll take this...                 He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it                 as though it contained something of value. Martin watches                 with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn t trust him.                 Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn t care what Martin                 thinks, nor does he explain. Martin leads the horse off.                                       MARTHA                          Supper ll be ready by the time you                           wash up... Let me take your coat for                           you, Ethan.                 He hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it -- conscious of                 its sorry condition.                                       MARTHA                               (smiling faintly)                          And... welcome home.                 He just nods, then turns to follow Aaron around the side of                 the house toward the wash-up.                 EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA                 She stands alone, looking after Ethan -- his coat in her                 arms. She holds it against her breast for just a moment and                 her eyes are tender.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT                 The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite,                 but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum                 tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace --                 in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the                 fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre                 Ethan has brought home from the wars.                 He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard.                 Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the                 other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last                 crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father s right and                 Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center                 of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal.                 Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his                 coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is                 watching Ethan.                 Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens                 contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.                                       ETHAN                          Good.                 The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its                 striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm                 gong. Eight fast clangs.                                       AARON                          Ben! Deborah! Bed!                                       DEBBIE                          But I ve got to help with the dishes.                                       MARTHA                          Not tonight... Ben, put that sword                           back.                                       BEN                          It s not a sword, ma... it s a saber!                               (moving to Ethan)                          Did you kill many damYankees with                           this sabre, Uncle Ethan?                                       ETHAN                               (matter-of-factly)                          Some...                                       BEN                          How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan?                                       MARTHA                          Ben!... Martin, he ll sleep in the                           bunkhouse with you tonight.                 Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night.                                       MARTIN                          Good night, Aunt Martha... Uncle                           Aaron...                               (he hesitates)                          Good night, Uncle Ethan.                 Ethan doesn t like being called Uncle -- as we must know                 from the quick look he shoots at Martin. But he acknowledges                 it.                                       ETHAN                          Night.                 Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.                                       BEN                          Will you tell me tomorrow about the                           war?                                       AARON                          The war ended three years ago, boy!                                       BEN                          It did?... Then whyn t you come home                          before now?                                       MARTHA                          BEN!... Go  long with Martin. MARCH!                 As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to                 Ethan s side and studies him gravely.                                       DEBBIE                          Lucy s wearing the gold locket you                           gave her when she was a little girl...                                       ETHAN                          Oh?                                       DEBBIE                          She don t wear it much account of it                           makes her neck green.                                       LUCY                               (aghast)                          Deborah!                                       DEBBIE                               (defensively)                          Well, it does... But I wouldn t care                           if you gave me a gold locket if it                           made my neck green or not.                 Ethan looks at her gravely.                                       ETHAN                           Fraid I...                               (then he remembers                                something, rises)                          Wait.                 He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something --                 and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side.                                       ETHAN                          How about this?                 It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to                 Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored                 satin ribbon.                                       DEBBIE                          Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!                 She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha                 takes it and reacts at its weight.                                       MARTHA                          It s solid gold... Ethan, I don t                           think she s old enough...                                       ETHAN                          Let her keep it... Just something I                           picked up in Mexico.                 Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie s eager hand.                 Aaron hasn t missed the word  Mexico  and looks sharply at                 Ethan.                                       DEBBIE                          Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan...                                       LUCY                               (to Debbie)                          Come along...                 The two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both                 look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation.                 He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to                 clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill --                 lights it at the fire.                                       ETHAN                          Passed the Todd place comin  in...                          What happened to  em?                                       AARON                          They gave up... went back to the                           cotton rows... So d the Jamisons...                          Without Martha, I don t know... She                           wouldn t let a man quit.                 Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes.                                       AARON                               (change of tone)                          Ethan, I could see it in you before                           the war...                               (Ethan looks at him)                          You wanted to clear out!                 Martha freezes in what she s doing -- listening.                                       AARON                          And you stayed out beyond all need                           to... WHY?                 Ethan can t answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost                 welcomes it.                                       ETHAN                               (hard)                          You askin  me to clear out now?                                       AARON                               (straightening --                                with grave dignity)                          You re my brother... You re welcome                           to stay as long as you got a mind                           to... Ain t that so, Martha?                                       MARTHA                               (almost a whisper)                          Of course he is.                                       ETHAN                          I expect to pay my own way...                 Martha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack,                 reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses                 it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink.                 Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table.                 (NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back-                lighted.)                                       ETHAN                          There s sixty double eagles in                           there... twelve-hundred dollars.                 He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather                 money belt and drops that on the table.                                       ETHAN                          An  twice that in here.                 He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold                 pieces which he slides across the table.                                       ETHAN                          ...only these got the late Emperor                           Maximilian s picture on  em.                 Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face                 on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply                 then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a                 different interest.                                       AARON                          Mint fresh... not a mark on  em.                 He glances questioningly at Ethan.                                       ETHAN                          So?                 Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the                 seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing                 and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money                 belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this                 Ethan s attention has gone to Martha s hand, to one cut                 finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently.                                       ETHAN                          Cut yourself?                 She nods and withdraws the hand.                                       ETHAN                               (softly)                          You were always hurting about your                           hands.                 She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide                 her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance.                 Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of                 sadness and hopelessness is in the look.                 Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.                                       AARON                          Time for bed...                 He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their                 bedroom door. Martha looks at Ethan again. His expression is                 bitter.                                       AARON                          Night, Ethan... Come  long, Martha.                 She turns obediently and follows Aaron. Ethan looks after                 them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door. Martha goes                 into it and Aaron follows and closes the door.                 Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out.                 Only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly                 at the closed bedroom door.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 OMITTED                 EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS  HOUSE - FAINT DAWN LIGHT                 Debbie s dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly                 ride toward the house and dismount. A lamp goes on inside.                 THE SIX HORSEMEN ARE:                 CAPTAIN, THE REVEREND SAM CLAYTON, a big man with frosty                 blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air                 of grave and resolute authority. He is a minister of the                 Gospel with a .44 on his hip.                 LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards  neighbor, is a harried little                 man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk                 and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children.                 BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable,                 impulsive. He is in his early twenties.                 CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of                 Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is                 a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned                 by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam.                 MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet                 capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him                  tetched  yet he has managed to endure to his age during a                 time and in a region where few men lived to see their                 grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather,                 a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band.                 ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties;                 resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or                 dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.                 16-A                 INT. EDWARDS  HOME - CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA                 She is at the window of her bedroom, wrapper clutched with                 one hand, lamp upraised in the other as she stares into the                 dawn to see who these callers are. We hear the heavy foot-                 falls of the approaching men, then a loud knock thrice                 repeated -- an ominous sound.                 OMITTED                 17-A                 INT. THE EDWARDS  - ANGLE AT DOOR                                       SAM S VOICE                          Aaron! Open up!... Sam Clayton!                 The door is opened by Aaron -- holding a lamp and a gun. He                 is only partly dressed -- pants, boots, undershirt. The bar                 of light slashes across the faces of Sam and some of the men                 behind him.                                       AARON                          Reverend...

Jorgensen enters -- an angry little man -- closely followed                 by Mose Harper, who is grinning foolishly.

His eyes brighten as he looks toward the fire and spots a                 rocking chair.

Martha sets out cups on the table, begins pouring the coffee.                 During the swearing-in, Ethan will enter the room from the                 inner door -- unnoticed by the other men, but not by Martha.                 And as the scene plays, the audience must always be conscious                 of the by-play of glances between Martha and Ethan as they                 face the prospect of being left in this house together.

THE EDWARDS  HOUSE -- DAWN LIGHT                 As Ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight                 of a couple -- Brad and Lucy -- in each other s arms, standing                 near the saddled horses of the posse. Clayton and Jorgensen                 following him out, spot the couple, who now belatedly are                 conscious of their audience.

Clayton chuckles and turns toward                 Martha, who has followed them out.

They start away.                 Ethan is last to ride out. He is watching Martha. He brings                 a gloved hand up in a salute. She starts to raise her hand                 but only brings it just above her waist, a fluttering gesture                 with tremulous fingers. It is the last he will ever see of                 her alive.                 EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS  HOUSE - FULL SHOT                 as the posse slowly rides out, with Ethan last. Martin reins                 in to let Debbie slip to the ground. Ethan passes her.                 Debbie stands watching the men ride away, waving at them.

Out to one side -- fifty yards                 distant -- is the main body of the posse: Sam, Jorgensen,                 Charlie, Ed, moving roughly parallel to Ethan but at a faster                 clip. Martin comes riding in toward Ethan from behind CAMERA.                                       MARTIN                               (calling)                          Uncle Ethan!

MARTIN                          What you want me to call you?                                       ETHAN                          Name s Ethan...

He breaks and all turn at a distant hail from Jorgensen.                                       JORGENSEN                          Look! Look!                 OMITTED                 EXT.

JORGENSEN S VOICE                               (excitedly)                          Brad! He s found them... Come on!                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - THE POSSE WITH BRAD IN                 THE DISTANCE                 as Jorgensen digs spurs and leads the way. The other riders                 follow.                 MED. SHOT - BRAD - RISING GROUND - LATE AFTERNOON                 He waits grimly until he sees them coming, then wheels his                 mount and takes off over the hill.                 FULL SHOT - THE POSSE                 as it comes up the rise and the men rein in on the crest.                 Jorgensen stares and his face mirrors shock and dismay.                 The other men look down into the long valley on the far side                 with equally grim expressions.                                       ETHAN                          Call that young fool back!                 Jorgensen doesn t even seem to hear him. Angrily Ethan whips                 out revolver and fires into the air. Then he swings his arm                 in a come-back gesture. He rides out ahead then a short                 distance and dismounts... and slowly the others follow.                 We see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun.                 Ethan goes to the nearest one. A feathered lance is driven                 into it. He pulls the lance out. Mose comes over beside him.                                       ETHAN                               (angrily)                          Caddo or Kiowa, huh?... Ain t but                           one tribe uses a lance like that!                 He hands the lance to Mose.                                       MOSE                               (almost a whisper)                          Ay-he... Comanch!                 Brad rides in -- shrill with anger.                                       BRAD                          Killed every one -- an  not for food                           either... Why d they do a thing like                           that?                                       ETHAN                          Stealing the cattle was just to pull                           us out... This here s a murder raid...                               (facing Jorgensen)                          It shapes up to scald out either                           your place... or my brother s.                 Jorgensen wilts and casts an anguished look back over the                 miles they have ridden.                                       JORGENSEN                          Mama!... Oh please... please no...                          BRAD!                 And with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow                 and they take off... fast. Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry                 follow. Sam Clayton pauses.                                       CLAYTON                          Jorgensen s place is closest... If                           they re not there, we ll come straight                           on!                 Then he too rides. Martin swings his horse back to where                 Ethan and Mose still are standing.                                       MARTIN                          Well, come on!                                       ETHAN                          Easy!

It ll be midnight                           before... I ain t waitin ...!                 He wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the                 others. Ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed                 his horse. Mose does the same.                                       MOSE                          Wisht it was Caddoes... or Kiowas...                               (shakes his head)                          Comanche...                 Ethan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins                 discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle.

A thin wisp of smoke rises from the chimney. And                 then Debbie s little dog trots around the side of the house                 out into the yard.                 EXT. EDWARDS YARD - CLOSE SHOT - THE DOG - SUNDOWN                 He comes to a standstill and his nose is working. He begins                 to make excited little sounds deep in his belly.                 Then he lies down, muzzle between his paws, watching,                 listening.                 INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - ANGLING TOWARD                 THE DOOR                 Debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll.                 The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area                 of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch                 steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a                 slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes.                  Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway,                 absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden                 peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and                 glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly                 at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun                 from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn t                 made a sound and is sure he s got away with it.                 He clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun                 pegged above the door.                                       AARON                          Think I ll see if I can pick off a                           sage-hen or two, Martha...                 INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED.

Aaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket, or whatever,                 by his side -- to disclose Ethan s cavalry sabre. Aaron smiles                 and rubs the youngster s head, then sets out across the yard.                 EXT.

He pauses every three or four strides --                 casting each quadrant in turn. Once he whips, gun ready, as                 a sage-hen or quail whirrs up not far from him. He smiles                 grimly as he watches it fly away. He keeps on.                 EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PORCH                 Martha comes to stand in the doorway. Ben doesn t look at                 her. His eyes -- like hers -- are fixed on the figure of the                 man.

He drops to one knee, half-leaning against the                 slope and slowly looks out... The CAMERA PANS very slowly,                 following his careful sweep of the terrain.                 The scene is entirely peaceful.                 EXT. RISING GROUND - CLOSE SHOT - AARON                 with narrowed eyes slowly scanning the ground. Suddenly the                 head whips right.

Aaron waits                 no longer, but slides down the slope and starts running at a                 crouch for the house, stopping every so often to look                 backward.

HOCH: What J.F. has in mind for this and the                 following scenes is the same kind of dramatic use of red you                 achieved in  Yellow Ribbon  in the scene telling of Custer s                 defeat.                 They are standing in the ruddy glare of the sunset and Ben                 has Ethan s sabre in his hand. We hear Aaron coming at a                 run, breathing hard. Ben takes a step as though to go to                 him, but Martha s hand at once is on his shoulder. Aaron                 gains the porch.                                       AARON                          In the house, boy... and...                 He puts finger to his lips, sign for Ben to say nothing.                 Ben nods and goes inside. Aaron and Martha face each other,                 the question large on her face. Slowly he nods the                 confirmation of her fears, then gently propels her ahead of                 him through the door.                 INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - SUNSET                 The room is deeply shadowed except where the dull crimson of                 the sun through door and windows slashes the blackness.                 Ben is waiting and Martha turns toward Aaron as he pulls the                 door shut, bars it and sets the shotgun down. He takes the                 revolver from his waist and Martha holds it as he reaches                 for his gun belt.                                       AARON                          Ben, close the shutters.                 Buckling on his gun belt, he moves toward the middle of the                 room, looking around him, taking inventory of his resources.                  Lucy slowly approaches, biting a knuckle, eyes wide with                 fright.                                       LUCY                          Pa?                 One shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing                 in goes out. Martha, Aaron and Lucy are dark silhouettes now                 against the red beam from another window.                                       MARTHA                               (sudden fear)                          Where s Deborah?...                               (calling it)                          DEBORAH!                 Debbie emerges from a shadowed corner into a beam of light.                 She is clutching her rag doll, nibbling a cookie. She holds                 it for them to see.                                       DEBBIE                          I only took one, ma... Topsy was                           hungry.                 Ben closes the shutter. And now the room is almost completely                 blacked out, except for the dying light filtering through                 the rifle ports of the closed shutters.                                                                     WIPE TO:                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - THE POSSE - DUSK                 This should be an expansive view to convey the fact that the                 posse has split -- the main group heading for the Jorgensen                 place, Martin forking off to race alone for the Edwards ranch.                 Coming toward and passing CAMERA is Martin, riding all out.                 Several hundred yards away and moving in a divergent direction                 are the others -- Brad and Charlie, Sam, Jorgensen and Ed                 Nesby. The men are not compactly bunched, but strung out,                 each taking his own best course and his own speed... As the                 riders pass and the dust of their passing, we see two other                 riders -- Ethan and Mose -- minute specks in the distance,                 possibly a mile or two behind.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN AND MOSE - DUSK                 (NOTE TO W. HOCH: What we are trying to get here is that                 moment of swift transition from twilight to night; of riders                 briefly touched with the last colors of day and then, as                 they pass, becoming one with blue shadows of night.)                 Ethan and Mose are holding their mounts to a jog, in marked                 contrast to the all-out pace of the others. The CAMERA PANS                 after them as the dark fingers of the night stretch across                 the valley. The wind begins to rise and somewhere off in the                 hills a coyote pack yaps.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 INT. EDWARDS - ANGLING PAST AARON AT WINDOW INTO ROOM -                 NIGHT                 Aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers                 into the night through a partly-opened shutter. Suddenly the                 room leaps alight as Lucy opens an inner door and enters,                 holding a lighted lamp. Aaron closes the shutter, spins on                 her angrily.                                       AARON                          LUCY!                 Martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp.                 In the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that                 Lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that Ben is                 crouched at another window -- rifle ready; and that Deborah                 is on her feet -- standing like a child who is being dressed.                                       LUCY                          I m sorry... I couldn t find the                           shawl...                                       AARON                          Hurry, Martha... Moon s fixin  to                           rise...                 He cautiously swings the shutters open. A pale light filters                 into the room. We see Martha wrapping the shawl around                 Deborah.                                       MARTHA                               (softly to the child)                          We re going to play the sleep-out                           game... Remember?... Where you hide                           out with grandma?                                       DEBBIE                          Where s she buried?                                       MARTHA                          And you ll go along the ditch --                          very quietly -- like a...

He reaches for the child, but he has to wait for Martha s                 last embrace.                                       MARTHA                          There!... And you won t come back or                           make a sound... no matter what you                           hear? Promise!... No matter what?                                       DEBBIE                          I promise... Wait!                                       AARON                          Child, child!

MARTHA                          Here she is, baby... Baby...                 Aaron takes the child, swings her out the window.                                       AARON                          Down low -- go!                 Martha would come to the window to look out, but Aaron bars                 her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to                 watch her go... Outside the little dog barks a welcome and                 presumably starts to follow the girl. Aaron reacts.                                       AARON                               (hoarse whisper)                          Here dog... here!                 The dog whines but obeys. Aaron continues watching the child s                 course -- unconsciously imitating her every run and twist...                 Then he smiles and we may see the brightness in the corners                 of his eyes.                                       AARON                          She reached the ditch...                 He closes the shutters and turns -- and his arms go around                 Martha, weeping soundlessly.                                       AARON                          She ll be all right, mother... she ll                           be all right.                 EXT. A HILLOCK WITH TWO HEADBOARDS - MED. CLOSE SHOT -                 NIGHT                 Nothing stirs and we hear nothing. Then, with faintest little                 rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow                 between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed                 against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the                 stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the                 scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals                 something glittering -- like beads. And the CAMERA from that                 ground-level shot                 RAISES QUICKLY TO:                 CLOSE SHOT - FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE - SCAR                 The Comanche we are later to know as SCAR is painted for war --                 tall, savage, mockingly looking down at what we know is the                 child s hiding place... And in that instant, from a dozen                 quarters and a dozen throats, sounds the wild yammer of the                 warwhoop!

Its breathing                 is a rasping whistle. Martin tries to haul its head up.                 Useless. Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the                 moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of                 the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard --                 struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes                 then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two                 horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face                 is alive with hope. He gets the rifle free at last and goes                 running toward the oncoming riders.                                       MARTIN                               (shouting)                          Ethan!... Ethan!                 The CAMERA SWINGS with him and we see Ethan and Mose                 approaching at the same steady gait.                                       MARTIN                               (waving)                          Uncle Ethan... it s me... Martin!                 Ethan doesn t slacken, nearly rides him down.                                       ETHAN                          Out of my way!                 Martin goes sprawling to his hands and knees. Mose continues                 without slowing.                 EXT. RISING GROUND - ANOTHER ANGLE - PAST THE RIDERS -                MOONLIGHT                                       MARTIN                               (desperately)                          Mose! Wait!...                 He goes running, stumbling after the riders -- desperately                 calling to them...                                       MARTIN                          Ethan!... Mose!...                 And then at the crest of the rising ground, he stops --                 We see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the                 barns and the hayricks and the house of Aaron Edwards.                 Martin runs down the slope.                 EXT. YARD AND APPROACH TO EDWARDS HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT                 (NOTE TO W. HOCH: Here again that use of red is suggested.)                 The ANGLE is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan                 as they ride in. Little tongues of fire are licking the edges                 of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are                 burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of                 the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral.                 There are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning                 is on the faces of the men as they dismount.                 Ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing                 arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what                 he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump.                 Slowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose                 shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks                 back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with                 senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges                 within the room and Ethan s muffled voice calling through                 the house:                                       ETHAN (O.S.)                          Lucy?... Deborah? Lucy?                 He strides back through the main room and out onto the porch                 just as Martin comes at a shambling run across the yard.                 Ethan takes a few steps out toward him. Martin would pass                 him, but Ethan grabs his arm.                                       ETHAN                               (harshly)                          You stay out!                 Martin tries to fight his arm free.                                       ETHAN                          Nothing for you to see.                                       MARTIN                          Leggo...                 Ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. Martin                 goes down -- out cold. And only now do we understand how                 merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the                 fallen figure.                                       ETHAN                          Don t let him go in there, Mose...                 And he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop.                 EXT. THE HILLOCK WITH THE TWO HEADBOARDS - FULL SHOT - ETHAN                 as he nears the graves.                                       ETHAN                               (calling)                          Lucy -- Lucy!                 He runs in, looking around him. He sees the little dog, dead                 on the ground. And then he sees a shadowed something:                 The shawl Debbie had worn. It is spread out, almost as though                 concealing a body. Fearfully he stoops and pulls it away...                 There is nothing there, but the shawl. He drops to his knees,                 his head bowed, his face tortured. The moonlight is clear on                 the face of the nearer headboard. It is of weathered wood                 and the chiselled letters on it read:                                          HERE LIES                                      MARY JANE EDWARDS                                     KILLED BY COMANCHES                                         MAY 12, 1852                            a good WIFE & MOTHER In her 41st year                                                            SLOW DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. THE HILLOCK - FULL SHOT - SLOWLY PANNING - DAWN LIGHT                 The funeral is begun. In the foreground are three newly-                 made crosses at the head of as many open graves -- which we                 need not see. With head bared, Sam Clayton is concluding his                 prayer. Near him stand the Jorgensen family: Mrs.  Jorgensen,                 Lars and LAURIE -- blonde, just beginning to reach her                 maturity -- and a stepping-stone of tow-headed children.                                       CLAYTON                          ...and to Your keeping we commend                           the souls of Aaron... Martha... and                           Benjamin Edwards...                 Mrs. Jorgensen and Laurie -- impelled by the same feminine                 sympathy and interest -- turn to look at Ethan and Martin.                 The PANNING CAMERA picks them up...Ethan standing dry-eyed,                 looking at the grave of Martha; Martin -- with bruised lip --                 looking out across the plain.                 Clayton now opens his small, well-worn Bible to a marked                 page.

Ethan turns on his heel and walks -- CAMERA PANNING -- to                 where Ed Nesby has been holding the horses. Brad is already                 mounting. Mose is there too and Charlie MacCorry.  Silhouetted                 against the dawn light are the rifles in each man s saddle                 scabbard. Clayton is right behind Ethan.

JORGENSEN                 Ethan is about to mount when Mrs. Jorgensen comes up and                 catches his arm.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Ethan...                               (he turns impatiently)                          Those girls mean as much to me as                           though they were my own... Maybe you                           don t know my Brad s been sittin  up                           with Lucy... and my Laurie s real                           fond of Martin...                 Ethan glances back at where Martin and Laurie are standing.                 ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LAURIE AND MARTIN                 The girl is looking at Martin full of compassion, tries to                 console him by taking his arm and squeezing it as he stares                 blindly at the graves and Jorgensen stolidly beginning the                 work of shovelling them full.                 EXT. NEAR HILLOCK - ETHAN AND MRS. JORGENSEN AS BEFORE                 Ethan looks back at her -- stone-faced.                                       ETHAN                               (impatiently)                          I d be obliged if you d get to the                           point, ma am.                                       MRS.

Ethan shrugs his arm free and mounts.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Promise me, Ethan!                 He ignores her and turns angrily to where Martin is.                                       ETHAN                               (harshly)                          Come on, if you re comin ...                 He digs spurs and rides out with the others. Martin comes                 over, with Laurie a step behind. His face is set, his eyes                 almost unseeing.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (a heartbroken murmur)                          Oh, Martin... Martin...

Laurie impulsively runs to his                 side, steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls                 herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the                 mouth.                 He looks at her dully, as though hardly conscious of it. And                 she is back beside her mother. Martin rides away after the                 others.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (slowly)                          I almost hope they don t find them!                 Laurie looks at her mother and understands.                                                                      CUT TO:                 61-A                 EXT.

Then Ed Nesby and old Mose, squinting                 at the ground as they ride, all but sniffing like an old                 hound dog.                 63A                 MARTIN - Next to last in file.

In the near distance, Clayton is leading the men of the search                 party at a fast clip toward the cairn. Charlie is standing,                 Brad tearing the rock cairn apart. In Charlie s hands is a                 Comanche head-dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers.                 Brad doesn t even look up as the men ride in and dismount,                 but continues his grim work of uncovering the buried Indian.

With that he strides to the cairn, whipping a knife out. he                 crouches over the body (O.S.) concealing what he is doing,                 he bends to his bloody task.

ETHAN                          But by what the Comanche believe --                           now he can t enter the spirit land,                           but has got to wander forever between                           the winds... because I took his mangy                           scalp!

The men mount (those who have                 dismounted) and they ride off.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 OMITTED                 EXT.

They move off, heading for their blankets. The CAMERA HOLDS                 on Ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side.                 He fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies                 it by the light of the flickering little fire.                 70-A                 CLOSE SHOT - THE MINIATURE - NIGHT                 It is a picture of Martha.

But if you re wrong,                           Captain Clayton, don t ever give me                           another!                 They look into each other s eyes a moment, then Sam turns to                 mount... and the others follow. Slowly then they start riding                 down the slope.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. FLAT GROUND, LIKE MARSH COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - THE                 SEARCHERS - DAWN MIST EFFECT                 (NOTE: It is now planned to shoot this on sound stage.)                 Fog and heavy morning mist rise from the swamp. Some cattails                 in the near ground. The effect is eerie, very still except                 for the trilling of frogs. Then, very quietly, the men emerge                 from the mist swirling around them. They are leading their                 horses. Sam looks baffled, angry. They stand still, listening --                 then slowly continue.                 EXT. FLAT GROUND - ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL SHOT - DAWN MIST                 (SOUND STAGE)                 The mist is thinning. In the f.g. is a small blackened area --                 the ashes of a campfire. The men come through the mist --                 wary, vigilant. It is Mose who first spots the fire. He runs                 to it and drops beside and feels the ashes.                 The others come up around him.                                       MOSE                          Ay-he...

ETHAN                          You got any more orders, Captain?                                       CLAYTON                               (quietly)                          Just keep goin ...                 They move on, slowly.                 74-A                 EXT. FLAT GROUND - FULL SHOT - MOVING (SOUND STAGE)                 The mist is thinning as the men warily move along.                 Suddenly there is the faint hoot of an owl from behind and                 to one side... the men turn slightly, hearing it... A moment                 later another owl hoot, from the same side but up ahead.                 From the interchange of looks, we must know that the riders                 are aware of its significance. Mose cups hand to his mouth                 and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls. Clayton                 glares at him.                                       MOSE                               (in soft apology)                          Jus  bein  sociable, Cap n...                 Ethan grins wryly. And now the first, faint, ruddy touch of                 the sun hits the slowly moving horsemen and begins to burn                 through the mist.                 74-B                 EXT. NEAR RIVER - PANNING SHOT - MORNING                 The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS from a sun-touched butte or crag to                 the file of men slowly walking their horses. An occasional                 shred of mist drifts by. Everything about the little cavalcade                 bespeaks tension, watchfulness. Suddenly -- and every man                 sees it at the same time -- we see a file of eight Comanches                 ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their                 horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel                 with, but slightly converging on, our group.                                       CLAYTON                               (softly)                          Keep goin ...                 Brad, who has been looking up ahead, sounds a new warning.                                       BRAD                               (tensely)                          Look!                                       CLAYTON                          Easy!                 74-C                 EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - PAST THE SEARCHERS                 Another Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon                 and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very                 quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly                 away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And                 then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group                 seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing                 the gap.                                       ETHAN                               (to Clayton)                          If you were tryin  to surround  em,                           you sure succeeded.                                       CLAYTON                          How far s the river from here, Mose?                                       MOSE                          I been baptized, Reverend... yes                           suh, been baptized, thank ye...                                       CLAYTON                          Well, you better brace yourself for                           another one... Ya-HEE!                 And with that yell, he drives spurs and cuts sharply at an                 angle to the converging Indian files -- and every man is                 with him. In the next instant, the Comanches whoop and give                 chase.                 74-D                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - THE CHASE                 with the Ranger group short-cutting in such a way as to                 outstrip the Comanche horsemen in a mad dash for the river.                 74-E                 EXT. THE RIVER S EDGE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP                 Clayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the Rangers                 reach the bank. They rein in, wheel their horses and are                 reaching for the rifles as the Comanche vanguard races into                 view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting                 their horses, rifles at their shoulders.                 The charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison --                 and the Indians wheel to shelter.                                       CLAYTON                          YA-HEE!                 And once again he spins his mount and takes off, across the                 river, followed by the others.                 74-F                 EXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT                 As the men pound across.                 74-G                 EXT. FAR BANK OF RIVER - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP                 They dismount and Charlie and Nesby take the horses and run                 them to some place of protection as the men group around                 Clayton and Ethan. During this:                                       CLAYTON                               (shouting his orders)                          This is as good as any... Charlie,                           you and Ed take the horses...                 Mose runs over and crouches beside Ethan. Beyond Ethan is                 Martin, then Brad... Nesby and Charlie will rejoin the group                 after an appropriate interval... with all the men shielded                 behind river boulders, etc.                 EXT. RIVER S EDGE - ANGLING PAST ETHAN AND MOSE WITH MARTIN                 AND BRAD BEYOND                 Ethan and Mose are hunkered down behind some rocks, very                 casual and business-like as they check rifles, set out and                 carefully wipe cartridges.                                       MOSE                               (chattily)                          Minds me o  the time Joe Powers an                            me fit us some Kiowas...                 Martin is in the throes of buck-fever, wiping mouth with                 back of his hand, peering anxiously across the river.                                       MARTIN                          You think they mean to charge us,                           Uncle Ethan...?

BRAD                               (staring across river)                          Criminy!                 EXT. RIVER S EDGE - LONG SHOT - PAST THE GROUP                 On the opposite bank, we see the full force of Comanches                 riding into sight -- racing their mounts to the edge, then                 wheeling off -- jeering, taunting. Brad starts to bring up                 his rifle.                                       ETHAN                          Steady, Daniel Boone! You don t want                           to miss... It makes them think their                           medicine s stronger than yours...                                       MOSE                          Ay-he...

One Comanche rides a few yards into the water, brandishing                 his rifle, taunting the white men. A moment later he is joined                 by a second brave.                                       ETHAN                               (grimly)                          Real sassy.                 He and Mose slowly bring their rifles to bear -- and then                 the two shots crack out almost simultaneously. And within                 split seconds both Comanches fall. The others race away.                 Sam comes charging over to Ethan and Mose.                                       CLAYTON                               (angrily)                          I didn t give any order to fire!

I don t                           need any formal invitation to kill a                           Comanch...                                       CLAYTON                               (grimly)                          You got one now!                 And he drops behind a rock as, with a wild whooping, the                 Comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit                 the river. The men open fire, all but Martin, who has frozen,                 staring wild-eyed at the oncoming Comanches.                 EXT. RIVER S EDGE - PROFILE SHOT - THE DEFENDERS                 Brad, Charlie, Clayton, Nesby are snapping shot after shot.                 Only Martin seems out of it. Ethan shoots him a glance.                                       ETHAN                          Slack your shoulders... Slack  em...                           Your hands ll take care of                           themselves...                 Some of the tension leaves Martin. Somehow his gun is in                 position and he is firing as fast and well as the others.                 77-A                 EXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT - INDIAN CHARGE                 The Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies                  necks, whooping and firing. Men and horses go down, counted                 off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans. But they keep                 coming.                 77-B                 EXT. RIVER S EDGE - PROFILE SHOT - PAST MARTIN, ETHAN, MOSE                 They drop their rifles now and pull out revolvers for close-                range work. One Comanche breaks through from the side, his                 buffalo lance ready for the thrust. Ethan whirls and fires.                 The Comanche horse charges through the defense line and out                 and there is a muffled scream of pain from Ed Nesby.                 77-C                 EXT. THE RIVER - WIDE ANGLE - THE INDIANS                 The charge breaks and Comanches wheel left and right, racing                 back across the river. With magnificent horsemanship, one                 brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows                 and swings him up behind. Two others, riding together, head                 for one of the two dead Comanches Ethan and Mose had downed                 on their first shots. Swinging simultaneously from their                 saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off.                 77-D                 EXT.

Ethan snuggles his rifle to his shoulder as two other racing                 Comanches prepare to pick up the other dead Indian. Most of                 the Comanches have regained the far bank now and are racing                 away. The firing from the Texans has stopped.                                       ETHAN                          I still got one out there.                 OMITTED                 EXT. RIVER S EDGE - CLOSE SHOT - BEHIND ETHAN                 The angle is along his rifle barrel as it beads on one of                 the racing Comanches trying to pick up the dead Indian.                 Clayton s big hand grasps the rifle barrel.                                       CLAYTON S VOICE                               (quietly)                          No, Ethan.                 EXT.

CLAYTON                          Let them bury their dead...                 Ethan pulls the gun free and looks out across the river.                 EXT. THE RIVER - LONG SHOT - PAST THEM                 The Comanches have done their work, are riding away -- and                 over the saddle of one lies the limp form of the dead Indian.                 Ethan looks back at Sam.                                       ETHAN                          That tears it, Reverend...

The CAMERA SWINGS to pick up the figure of Nesby outstretched                 on the ground, writhing in pain; with Charlie kneeling beside                 him. The men cross to stand around the fallen man.                                       CHARLIE                          Reckon we got to go back -- Ed s                           shoulder is smashed -- bad!

Brad and Martin look at each                 other as the full import of Ethan s footnote strikes home.                 Then they head for their own horses.

The three re-enter the river and slowly start across, with                 Clayton gravely looking after them. The three riders continue                 across the river... and the Search Theme resumes.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. WIDE ANGLE - DESERT COUNTRY - BLAZING NOON                 A region of buttes and giant rock formations; treeless, arid                 and seemingly reaching out to infinity. Far off we see a                 cloud of dust -- miles and miles off. Only the dust, nothing                 else. From behind CAMERA ride the three men -- Ethan, Brad,                 and Martin -- dust-powdered, eyes bloodshot. The three are                 watching that distant cloud of dust. They force their weary                 horses onward.                                                                     WIPE TO:                 EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON                 The ANGLE is past some spectacular butte or citadel of rock                 into another long reach of valley -- different from the first                 view of it, yet alike in its suggestion of endlessness.                 But now there is no cloud of dust far away -- nothing to                 suggest the passage of anything but time itself.                 Ethan, Martin, and Brad ride into the fringe of the butte s                 shadow and scan the terrain ahead.                                       BRAD                               (shrill)                          They got to stop sometime... if                           they re human at all, they got to                           stop!                                       ETHAN                          Naw... a human man rides a horse                           till it dies... then he goes on                           afoot... A Comanche comes along...                           gets that horse up... and rides it                           twenty more miles... Then he eats                           it.                 Ethan turns to catch Martin thirstily drinking from his                 canteen.                                       ETHAN                               (angrily)                          Easy on that!                                       MARTIN                          Sorry...

BRAD                          You ve said that enough!...

The three riders come to where the trail they have been                 following forks... the main horseprint track leading ahead,                 a lesser track heading for a narrow gap between two buttes.                                       MARTIN                          Four of  em cut out here... Why?                 Ethan thinks he knows why. His face is bleak. But he tries                 to be casual.                                       ETHAN                          I ll take a look... You keep after                           the others...                 He turns his mount toward the gap.                                       MARTIN                               (eagerly)                          You want us to fire a shot if...

I ll meet you on the                           far side.                 He s still grumbling as he rides off. An abashed Martin rides                 ahead along the broad trail with Brad.                 (NOTE: Ethan s serape, tied behind his saddle, should be                 clearly seen as he rides away -- not pointed up, but visible.)                                                                     WIPE TO:                 EXT. FAR SIDE OF BUTTE - TWILIGHT                 Martin and Brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in                 which they had taken off -- indicating their circle route --                 haul up momentarily as they spot Ethan, standing beside his                 horse, his back to them, some distance along. They turn                 slightly off their course and ride out toward him.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - NEAR BUTTE - TWILIGHT                 Ethan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in.                 His serape is no longer behind his saddle. Ethan looks at                 them blankly for a minute -- as though not really seeing                 them.                                       ETHAN                          Oh... it s you.                 They both stare at him.                                       ETHAN                               (a vague gesture)                          I... uh... here s where they met up                           again...                 They both can see that.                                       ETHAN                               (pointing)                          Trail leads off there...                 They look at him and each other -- for these are clearly                 unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from Ethan.                                       BRAD                          Why d they break off?                               (no answer)                          Was there water in that canyon?                                       ETHAN                          Huh...?  No... no water.                                       MARTIN                          You all right, Ethan?

He goes to his horse, mounts. Martin is right beside him and                 he notes the missing serape.                                       MARTIN                          Say!...

Anyway, I ain t goin                            back to look for it...                 He leads out. Brad rides up beside Martin. Again the two                 exchange puzzled looks. Martin shrugs and the three continue                 along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting                 sun.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. NIGHT CAMP - A POCKET IN THE HILLS - TWILIGHT                 Ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so                 that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. Beyond him                 Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. The men have                 come to the end of another long day. Both men look up as                 Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the                 incline to their camp. His horse is lathered.                                       BRAD                               (shouting it)                          I saw her!... I saw Lucy!                 Martin runs to his side as Brad slides off his mount.                 Ethan moves more slowly.                                       BRAD                               (continuing)                          They re camped  bout two miles over...                          I was just swingin  back when I saw                           their smoke... I bellied up a ridge                           an  they was right below me...                                       MARTIN                          Did you see Debbie?                                       BRAD                          No, but I saw Lucy all right... She                           was wearin  that blue dress... an                            she was walkin  along...                                       ETHAN                               (voice flat)                          What you saw wasn t Lucy.

ETHAN                          What you saw was a buck wearin                           Lucy s dress...                               (they stare at him)                          I found Lucy back there in that                           canyon... I wrapped her in my blanket                           an  buried her with m own hands... I                           thought it best to keep it from you --                           long as I could.                 He can t look at Brad or at Martin. Brad can t speak -- and                 then finally:                                       BRAD                          Did they...? Was she...?                 Ethan wheels on him in shouting fury.                                       ETHAN                               (blazing)                          What ve I got to do -- draw you a                           picture?... Spell it out?... Don t                           ever ask me!... Long as you live                           don t ever ask me more!                 Brad wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. He turns --                 walking stiff-legged as though on stilts back to his horse.                 He bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his                 grief. Martin turns away from him and walks back to Ethan.                 And in that moment, Brad mounts and takes off in the same                 direction from which he had ridden in.                                       MARTIN                               (frantically)                          BRAD!...                 They run for their horses.

ROUGH ROLLING COUNTRY - NIGHT - MOVING - CLOSE SHOT -                 BRAD                 He comes pounding down a slope, and he takes off his hat and                 skims it away. He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve                 the rush of raging blood.                 92-B                 EXT. THE EDGE OF A RISE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BRAD - NIGHT                 He reaches the crest and reins in. A distant firelight is on                 his face. He takes one moment to look down into the Comanche                 camp o.s. Then he has his gun out. His eyes are wild, his                 face wet with sweat. Then he throws back his head and he                 yells -- and with the yell goes charging into the camp.                 92-C                 EXT. A RIDGE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - NIGHT                 They rein in -- staring -- as from afar they hear Brad s                 yell echoing and bouncing off the canyon walls. There is                 nothing they can do. They hear his shouts, then the quick                 bark of his .44, and the angry shouts of the Comanche.                 92-D                 EXT.

His gun cracks once, then again -- and the hammer clicks                 on a spent shell.                 92-E                 EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - CLOSE SHOT - SCAR - NIGHT                 He stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched. He releases                 it at his running target. We hear its impact and a high gasp                 of pain... and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other                 Comanches.                 92-F                 EXT. A RIDGE - FULL ON MARTIN AND ETHAN AS BEFORE - NIGHT                 The distant yammering of the Comanches doesn t quite drown                 out one stifled scream of pain; we can surmise a scalping                 knife was busy in the last instance of Brad s life. Martin                 slumps in his saddle. Ethan listens a moment, then turns to                 Martin.                                       ETHAN                          Let s just hope he took some with                           him...                 He turns his horse back the way they had come. Martin stares                 at him.                                       MARTIN                          What you goin  to do?

Slowly, reluctantly but helpless to                 do otherwise, Martin follows.

PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - DAY                 A study of horseprints etched in the soil -- the mark of the                 passage of many horses; perhaps an eagle or turkey feather                 fallen from a warbonnet. And then we hear and see the approach                 of two plodding horses, and the dusty boots of the horsemen --                 Ethan and Martin -- following the trail. The Search Theme                 resumes and continues over the next three shots, helping us                 suggest the passage of time, the change of scene.                 EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY                 The two figures are little more than specks in a vastness of                 savage country.

Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow                 flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly                 beards.                                       MARTIN                               (bitterly)                          Say it. We re beat!

It is a year and a half later.                 The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of                 sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two                 separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room,                 the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen                 brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or                 two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and                 Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In                 that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars                 Jorgensen comes to the door.                 EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT                 Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing                 them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their                 appearance and full of unspoken questions.                 Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside                 her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in                 her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her.                 Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even                 looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as                 Ethan and Martin dismount.                 EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN                 The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue                 during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image                 of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick                 of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or                 paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception.                 They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search;                 and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is                 running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though                 he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands                 frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches                 a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen.                                       ETHAN                               (to Jorgensen)                          You got my letter about your son,                           Brad?                                       JORGENSEN                          Yah... Just about this time a year                           ago...                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          It came the day before his...                            birthday.                                       JORGENSEN                          The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh                           away...                 Mrs. Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. Martin hangs                 back.                                       MARTIN                          I ain t fit to go indoors, miz                           Jorgensen... These clothes is...                 Laurie rushes past her mother.                                       LAURIE                          Martie!                 She kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes                 for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement.                 Martin is just bowled over.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (teasing)                          And him probably forgettin  all about                           you!... Probably can t even call                           your name to mind.                                       MARTIN                               (smiling)                          Laurie.                 And Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother.                                       MARTIN                               (continuing)                          But I fairly forgot just how pretty                           you was...                 Laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there                 is no further resistance from Martin.                 Mrs. Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and                 her face is gravely questioning.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          The little one?... Debbie?                 Ethan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and                 they start indoors.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM OF THE JORGENSEN S - MED. SHOT -                 MARTIN - NIGHT                 This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room --                 and described in the book as the  grandmother room : with                 narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly                 a fireplace.                 Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying                 his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door.                 It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being                 casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool                 or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered.                                       MARTIN                          Hey... What you doin ...?                 She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches                 for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through                 a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During                 this:                                       MARTIN                               (a yelp)                          Don t go takin  that stuff...

And she is laughing as she closes the door behind her.                 INT. THE KEEPING ROOM OF THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT                 It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big                 wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots;                 the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the                 good plain Swedish modern of today.                 There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told,                 a cheerful, warm-smelling room.                 Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying                 Martin s shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait,                 listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get                 her mother s attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual                 chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less                 in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is                 in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near                 the mantel.                                       ETHAN                          ...an  then it snowed and we lost                           the trail... No need to tell ya all                           the places we went... Fort Richardson,                           Fort Wingate an  Cobb... the Anadarko                           Agency... Trouble is we don t even                           know which band that war party                           belonged to...                 Mrs. Jorgensen looks up from her darning.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.                                       ETHAN                          I got your boy killed.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (gently)                          Don t go blamin  yourself...                                       JORGENSEN                               (angrily)                          It s this country killed my boy!...                           Yes, by golly!                 Mrs. Jorgensen stands.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Now Lars!... It so happens we be                           Texicans... We took a reachin  hold,                           way far out, past where any man has                           right or reason to hold on... Or if                           we didn t, our folks did... So we                           can t leave off without makin  them                           out to be fools, wastin  their lives                            n wasted in the way they died... A                           Texican s nothin  but a human man                           out on a limb... This year an  next                           and maybe for a hundred more.  But I                           don t think it ll be forever.  Someday                           this country will be a fine good                           place to be... Maybe it needs our                           bones in the ground before that time                           can come...                 The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn t                 heard a word of it.                                       LAURIE                          Ma!... Martie s drawers is a sight!                            Ain t fit for rags!... Would it be                           all right if we gave him some of                           Brad s things?                 There is just the briefest hesitation...                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Why... course it would! They re in                           the chest...                 And she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a                 big chest at the far end of the room.                                       JORGENSEN                               (rising excitedly)                          By golly, the letter... In the chest,                           mama... It came for you, Ethan...                            last winter...                 Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen                 is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a                 letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths.                                       JORGENSEN                               (continuing)                          Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought                           it...                 Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before                 venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying                 not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling                 out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully                 opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely                 printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two-                inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He                 reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused                 to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and                 looks at the snip of cloth.                                       ETHAN                               (quietly)                          Mrs. Jorgensen...                 She comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and                 Laurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long-                handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes,                 etc.                                       ETHAN                          Will you look at this?                 He holds out the snip of calico.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Why it s just a snip of calico...                                       ETHAN                          You ever see it before... like mebbe                           on a dress Debbie wore?                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Yes!... Yes, I remember!... Have                           they found her, Ethan?                                       ETHAN                          No... not yet...                 He takes the calico snip, places it within the letter and                 carefully pockets it. He looks broodingly into the fire.                                       ETHAN                               (continuing)                          ...not yet...                 Laurie s face is troubled as she turns from him and heads                 for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes.                 INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM - FULL SHOT - NIGHT                 Martin is sitting sulkily on a cot, wrapped in a blanket.                 He glares up as Laurie enters. His feet are in his boots.                                       MARTIN                          Might at least have left me my pants!                                       LAURIE                          Shush!... Time for bed anyway...                               (putting clothes near                                him)                          Likely these ll need some takin                            in... Oh, Martie, you re that gaunted!                           ...Ma s havin  a turkey for dinner                           tomorrow and...                                       JORGENSEN S VOICE                               (calling)                          Laurie!... Come... come!                 Ethan opens the door, enters.                                       LAURIE                          Yes, Pa!... Good night, Martie...                            good night, Mr. Edwards...                 She wants to kiss Martie but is shy in Ethan s presence and                 hurries out.                                       MARTIN                          Good night... Laurie...                                       ETHAN                          Good night...                 Martin stoops to remove his boots. Ethan studies him and                 looks thoughtfully after the girl and at Martin.                 He takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant                 to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively.                 He starts to undress. Martin lies back on his bunk.                                       ETHAN                          Jorgensen s been runnin  his cattle                           with my own...                                       MARTIN                               (staring)                          YOUR cattle?... DEBBIE S cattle!                 Ethan returns the stare without any change of expression.                                       ETHAN                          He s agreed to take you on and share                           the increase from my herd while I m                           gone... I ll be pushin  on tomorrow...                                       MARTIN                          I ain t stayin ... I set out lookin                            for Debbie... I aim to keep on...                                       ETHAN                          Why?                                       MARTIN                          Because she s my... my...                                       ETHAN                          She s your nothin ... She s no kin                           to you at all!                                       MARTIN                          I always felt like she was... Her                           folks takin  me in, raisin  me like                           one of their own...                                       ETHAN                          That don t make  em kin...                                       MARTIN                          All right... I ain t got no kin...                            I m goin  to keep lookin  that s                           all.                                       ETHAN                          How? You got any horses, or money to                           buy  em... You ain t even got money                           to buy cartridges... Jorgensen s                           offering you a good livin  here...                 Martin throws himself back, turns his face to the wall.                 Ethan looks soberly at him -- and is sorry for the brutality                 of his words.                                       ETHAN                          Martin... I want you to know                           somethin ...                                       MARTIN                               (turning -- mad as                                hell)                          Yeah... you want me to know I ain t                           got no kin -- no money -- no horses --                           nothing but a dead man s clothes to                           wear!... You tole me that already...                            Now shut your head!                                       ETHAN                          Good night.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - WIDE ANGLE - DAWN LIGHT                 It is a still scene, with the first light of day in the sky,                 a thin plume of smoke rising from the chimney.                 INT. THE JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT - LAURIE -                 DAWN LIGHT                 She is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly                 around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her                 flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails                 the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a                 coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the                 grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in                 Brad s clothes. His eyes whip around the room. Laurie doesn t                 turn as he slowly approaches.                                       LAURIE                               (quietly)                          Ethan rode on... an hour ago.                 The starch goes out of him. He walks heavily to the table                 and sits, slumped. She looks at him compassionately.                                       LAURIE                          I don t know what you can do about                           finding Debbie that he can t...                 He just shakes his head, not looking at her. She lifts the                 food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him.                                       LAURIE                          He ll find her now, Martie... Please                           believe me... I know.                 He shakes his head. She crosses to the stove for the coffee                 pot.                                       MARTIN                          That s what scares me -- him findin                            her.                 Now it is her turn to stare.                                       MARTIN                          Laurie, I ve seen his eyes when he                           so much as hears the word  Comanche                            ...I ve seen him take his knife an                            ...never mind... But he s a man can                           go crazy wild... It might come on                           him when it was the worst thing could                           be... What I counted on, I hoped to                           be there to stop him, if such thing                           come.                 Laurie has poured his coffee. Now he sips it. She sits at                 the table with him.                                       LAURIE                               (slowly)                          I hoped I could hold you here... But                           I guess I knew... So I stole this                           for you...                 She takes Ethan s letter from her breast and hands it to                 him. He takes it, puzzled, and slowly reads it aloud.                                       MARTIN                           I bought a small size dress off a                           Injun...

I just                           gotta catch up with Ethan...                 He runs out and she slams the door, then rests her head                 against it.                 113-A                 INT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - EARLY MORNING                 Mrs. Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with                 head pressed against the door. She wants to offer some word                 of sympathy, but doesn t know what to say. She crosses to                 the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee. Then we hear the                 drum of horses  hooves, the sound of Martin riding away.                  Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him                 back.                 113-B                 EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY AND LAKE BEFORE JORGENSEN HOUSE - EARLY                 MORNING                 ANGLING from behind Laurie in the doorway as Martin, riding                 one horse, leading another, goes galloping away.                 EXT. FUTTERMAN S TRADING POST - WIDE ANGLE - DAY                 Low, squat adobe structure, with a crudely lettered sign-                board proclaiming it:                                   JEREM. FUTTERMAN, TRADER                  There are adjacent outbuildings and corral. Four horses are                 tied outside, two being pack animals. A surly-looking white                 man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door,                 whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses                 covetously. He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles                 along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back.                                       MAN                          Andale! Andale!                 Fearfully she quickens her step. The man gets up, shoves                 knife into belt and heads into the post.                 INT. FUTTERMAN S TRADING POST - FULL SHOT - DAY                 It is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on                 shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables                 and benches.                 The breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table                 where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a                 game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards.                 Ethan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room,                 examining a dirty, rumpled child s dress -- Debbie s.                 Martin nods soberly in answer to Ethan s inquiring look;                 yes, it s hers. Both look up as FUTTERMAN crosses from the                 bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his                 fingers thrust inside the glasses. Futterman is a squaw man                 and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face.                                       FUTTERMAN                          Drink?                 He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey                 and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin                 regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes                 the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. Martin                 snatches it out of his hand.                                       ETHAN                               (harshly)                          How d you come by this?                                       FUTTERMAN                          You said there d be a thousand dollar                           reward.                                       ETHAN                          That s what I said.                                       FUTTERMAN                          You got it with you?                 Ethan looks at him and beyond toward the two men.                 INT. FUTTERMAN S - CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO PLUG-UGLIES                 The solitaire player has a card in mid-air -- frozen,                 watching. The other man has the same buzzard-watchful look.                 INT. FUTTERMAN S - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE                                       ETHAN                          Reward ll be paid when I find her --                           an  if she s alive...                 Futterman uncorks the jug, prepares to drink.                                       FUTTERMAN                          Man s got a right to expect some                           kind o  payment...

He tilts the jug to his mouth as Ethan reaches for his heavy                 leather pouch. Futterman watches greedily as Ethan lets a                 gold piece slide out. He tosses it onto the table.                                       ETHAN                          Twenty Yankee dollars.                 Futterman puts the jug down. His hand inches -- as though                 pulled by a magnet -- toward the gold piece.                                       FUTTERMAN                          ...an  a man s time is worth                           somethin ...                 Ethan s big hand clamps over Futterman s and he starts                 squeezing as a man would squeeze a lemon. Futterman s lips                 whiten.                                       ETHAN                          Talk!                                       FUTTERMAN                          A young buck fetched it in late last                           summer...                               (Ethan eases the grip)                          Said it belonged to a captive chile                           of Chief Scar...                                       ETHAN                          Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.                                       FUTTERMAN                          Me neither... But this buck claimed                           he was a big war chief with the                           Nawyecky Comanches.

That s what this buck                           said... Maybe he lied.                                       ETHAN                          And maybe you lie...                                       FUTTERMAN                          In that case you won t find her --                          and I won t get my thousand dollars.                 Ethan stands. Martin follows. Martin takes the dress and                 folds it carefully.                                       FUTTERMAN                               (too casually)                          Stay the night if you want...                               (Ethan shakes his                                head)                          Cards?... A jug?... If you d like                           some company, we got a few squaws on                           the place...                 Ethan and Martin head for the door.                                       ETHAN                          No thanks.                 The two plug-uglies stand -- mean ready to do their master s                 bidding.                                       FUTTERMAN                          Don t forget to come back with my                           thousand dollars.                                       ETHAN                          Ain t yours yet.                 They leave. The CAMERA holds on Futterman as he slowly rubs                 his bruised hand. His henchmen drift toward him.                                       FUTTERMAN                               (slight smile)                          Bad manners...

SHOT - ETHAN - NIGHT                 They have set up camp near a cluster of cottonwoods to which                 the horses have been tied. One of the horses is restless,                 possibly nickering. Ethan strokes its neck, looking out                 thoughtfully into the night -- listening.                                       MARTIN S VOICE                          Acts like somethin s out there.                                       ETHAN                               (heading toward                                campfire)                          Smells a change in the weather...                 CAMERA PANS him to where Martin is spreading his blanket                 some little distance from the small fire.                                       ETHAN                          Wouldn t surprise me if we didn t                           have a frost  fore mornin ... Here...                               (he picks up a saddle                                and puts it close to                                fire)                          Whyn t you bed down closer to the                           fire, boy?                 Martin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and                 spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a                 pillow. Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry                 wood on the fire, making it blaze up.                                       MARTIN                          Hey! What s the idea...?                                       ETHAN                          Maybe I m gettin  like Mose Harper --                           my bones is cold tonight...                 He spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll,                 and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to                 suggest it is over the figure of a man. During this:                                       MARTIN                          Funny... When we passed through Fort                           Wingate last winter, we didn t hear                           mention of any Nawyecky Comanche                           there...                 Ethan steps back -- and studies the  dummy.                                        ETHAN                          Not so funny... if you recollect                           what  Nawyecka  means...                                       MARTIN                          What s that?                 Ethan studies Martin s back -- the light on him -- and looks                 around figuring the range of fire.                                       ETHAN                          Sorta like  roundabout  -- like a                           man says he s goin  one place when                           he means to go just the reverse...                                       MARTIN                               (drowsily)                          Oh...                                       ETHAN                          You all settled an  comfortable now?                 Martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. Ethan                 nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn t going to change                 positions. Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them                 to complete the dummy. He picks up his rifle then and quietly                 walks out of the camp.                                                                      CUT TO:                 EXT. HILLY COUNTRY - A RAVINE OR ARROYO - FULL SHOT - THREE                 MEN - NIGHT                 Three shadowy figures -- Futterman and his two henchmen --                 are quietly dismounting, taking rifles from saddle scabbards.                 At a hand signal from Futterman, they quietly fan out afoot.                 EXT. NIGHT CAMP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN                 still snug in his blankets, sound asleep; the fire burning a                 little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him.                 EXT. HILLY COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND FUTTERMAN AND                 HIS HENCHMEN                 At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some                 rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the                 camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan s dummy, hat                 over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen                 snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks...                 and one man is knocked flat on his face.                 The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle                 swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the                 night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist...                 Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman                 starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman,                 dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the                 back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into                 the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now.                 EXT. NIGHT CAMP - FULL SHOT - MARTIN                 He is staring at Futterman, face down and almost at his feet.                 He looks around in fear at someone approaching -- hand going                 to his gun. Then he relaxes as Ethan casually enters the                 camp, bareheaded, carrying his rifle.                                       ETHAN                          Thanks... you did just fine...                 Ethan kneels beside Futterman, turns him over, reaches into                 his pockets -- first one, then another.

ETHAN                          He just couldn t wait...                                       MARTIN                               (watching him go                                through pockets)                          Whatchu doin ?...                 Ethan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold                 piece in the air, catches it and pockets it.                                       ETHAN                          Even got my twenty dollars back...                          We did all right.                 And now Martin is getting the whole picture... and he s mad.                                       MARTIN                          WE?...

I coulda                           had my brains blowed out!                 Ethan is just grinning at him -- completely unruffled, denying                 none of it.

Ethan sobers a little, seems honestly surprised.                                       ETHAN                          Never occurred to me...                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - WIDE ANGLE - DAY                 It is a day in early winter. Charlie MacCorry, short-coated,                 is galloping across the yard as Jorgensen crosses it --                 carrying a load of firewood.                                       CHARLIE                               (calling it)                          Howdy, Mister Jorgensen...                                       JORGENSEN                          Charlie...                 MacCorry swings off his saddle near the porch, as the door                 opens and Mrs. Jorgensen comes out -- shawled against the                 cold.                                       CHARLIE                          Got a letter here...                 Jorgensen lets the cordwood drop...                                       JORGENSEN                          By golly!

He got a right to listen too!                 Mrs. Jorgensen has been pulling and pushing chairs around                 and now they all take places. Jorgensen automatically reaches                 for his glasses on the mantel and puts them on -- even though                 he isn t going to read the letter. Laurie has been sneaking                 looks at some of the other pages.

LAURIE                           There is one other thing I got to                           tell you before you hear it from                           Ethan... How I got myself a wife ...                 She stops and stares.                                       LAURIE                          A WIFE?                 She looks at them - dazed.                                       CHARLIE                               (delightedly)                          He did?                                       JORGENSEN                               (smacking his knee --                                very happy indeed)                          Good! A young man should get married                           early in life. Right, mama?                 Mrs. Jorgensen, full of sympathy for Laurie, just glares at                 her husband.                                       JORGENSEN                          Every young man should at least                           once...Go on, Laurie! Read!                                       LAURIE                               (haltingly)                          A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!                 And with that she crumples the letter and throws it into the                 fire.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (aghast)                          Laurie!                 Jorgensen is out of his chair and scrambling in the fireplace                 to recover the letter. He fetches it out, beating the sparks                 out. The letter is basically undamaged.                                       JORGENSEN                               (sternly)                          Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie                           ...Mama maybe you better read it...                               (to Charlie, proudly)                          My wife was a school teacher, Charlie                           ...She reads good.                 Laurie snatches the letter back.                                       LAURIE                          I ll read it...                 Charlie crosses the room, picks up a guitar.                                       CHARLIE                               (smugly)                          So he married a Comanche squaw...                           Haw haw haw!                 Laurie glares at him. He begins chording the guitar.                                                                     WIPE TO:                 EXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND  LOOK  -                 FALL OR EARLY WINTER - DAY                  LOOK  is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon-toed, platter-                faced and wide-eyed. Over her arm is a very handsome blanket.                 She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a                 Comanche -- her father. Martin, with an armful of trade goods --                 a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes                 and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances                 shyly at her father.                 He shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed.                 The father points to Martin s pile of trade goods. Martin                 bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered                 high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and                 puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the                 blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one                 finger: wait! Then she runs back through the other Comanches                 now crowding forward.                 EXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL SHOT -                 INCLUDING ETHAN                 who rides in slowly, leading their pack horse and Martin s                 horse.                                       ETHAN                               (quietly)                          Let s go... I think I stumbled onto                           somethin ...                                       MARTIN                               (eagerly)                          Scar?                 The name registers with some of the nearer braves. There is                 a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile.                                       ETHAN                               (angrily)                          When are you goin  to learn to keep                           your mouth shut! Come on.  Let s get                           out of here.                                       MARTIN                          But I just bought a good blanket.                                       ETHAN                               (curtly)                          Forget it...                 Martin mounts and the two ride out. The Comanches stare after                 them suspiciously, resentfully.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - MOVING                 SHOT - EARLY WINTER DAY                 They are riding down a slight grade beyond which (we can                 assume) is the Comanche camp.                                       ETHAN                          What I heard back there was that a                           band o  hostile Nawyeckas came through                           this way less n two weeks ago...                                       MARTIN                               (excitedly)                          Think it might be...?                 He breaks and both turn as Look rides over the hill on a                 little spotted Indian pony, with her squaw-bag slung up behind                 her and her blanket over the saddle. She closes the gap                 between them.                                       ETHAN                          What s she followin  for?                 Look smiles shyly at Martin.                                       MARTIN                          Look, I changed my mind... You can                           keep your blanket.                 He gestures for her to go back.                                       MARTIN                          Go on back...                 She stares and then dutifully wheels her horse. Martin and                 Ethan face front again. Look wheels her horse again and is                 right with them. Martin stops - exasperated.                                       MARTIN                          Look... you don t understand...                               (he waves her away)                          I don t want it.                 Look just sits.                                       ETHAN                               (explosively)                          YOU don t understand, ya chunkhead!                            You didn t buy any blanket! Ya bought                           her!                                       MARTIN                               (aghast)                          What?                                       ETHAN                          You got yourself a wife, sonny!                                       MARTIN                               (a wail)                          Oh no! Tell her she s got to go                           back...                                       ETHAN                          And have her whole family after our                           scalps for floutin  one o  their                           women?... No sir! Come on, Mrs.                           Pauley...                 Look smiles and sets her horse in motion as Ethan moves ahead.                 Martin s face is a mask of comic despair as he gives up. He                 is mouthing the words --                                       MARTIN                          Mrs... Pauley?                 And Ethan suddenly breaks into song; to the tune of  Skip To                 My Lou:                                        ETHAN                               (singing)                          I got another gal purtier n you.  I                           got another gal purtier n you.  I                           got another gal purtier n you.  Skip                           to my Lou, my darlin .                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. NIGHT CAMP - OPEN COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - NIGHT                 Ethan is wrapped in his blanket roll, head propped by an                 elbow, grinning sardonically as he watches a strange ritual                 in the camp. The score is softly reprising  Skip to my Lou.                  EXT. NIGHT CAMP - FULL SHOT - PAST ETHAN - NIGHT                 Look is standing with her blanket folded over one arm, her                 head shyly downcast, not far from where Martin (back to her)                 is spreading his own bed roll. He sits on it then and begins                 pulling off his boots. He is very conscious of Ethan s                 watchful scrutiny. Finally he is ready. He lies back on his                 blanket. At once Look is at his side to spread her own                 blanket. Martin sits bolt upright and tugs his blanket free                 and wraps it protectively around him. She stares at him,                 puzzled.                                       MARTIN                          Water!...                               (in Comanche)                          Pah!                 She nods her understanding, hurries off to fetch a canteen.                 Martin glares at Ethan.                                       ETHAN                          That s the way to train  em. Looks                           like Mrs. Pauley s goin  to make you                           a fine beautiful wife...                                       MARTIN                          Cut it out, will ya...                 Look returns with the canteen, hands it to Martin and kneels                 beside him. He looks at her sympathetically.                                       MARTIN                          Look... I wish I could explain to                           you.                 And now Look speaks for the first time. She indicates herself.                                       LOOK                          Look?...                 Now she jabbers in Comanche and, at the appropriate time,                 will point to the sky and imitate a bird flying.                                       LOOK                          Nay tzare T sala-ta-komal-ta-name...                            unt kang-yah Look.                               (which means)                          (My father calls me Wild Goose Flying                           in the Night Sky... but you call me                            Look ).                 Martin looks blank, but Ethan chuckles.                                       ETHAN                          Says her name s Wild Goose Flying in                           the Night Sky... but she ll answer                           to Look since it pleases ya...                                       MARTIN                               (blankly)                          Look?                 She nods and smiles and quickly settles alongside him and                 spreads her blanket over them both. Martin recoils, plants                 his foot in the small of her back and sends her sprawling.                 Ethan busts a gut laughing. Martin jumps to his feet, angrily.                                       MARTIN                               (hotly)                          I don t think it s so funny... If                           you want to do some good, whyn t you                           ask her where Scar is?                 Ethan stares at the girl. Her face is suddenly impassive as                 she looks from Martin to the ground.                                       ETHAN                               (grimly)                          She heard ya-all right... An  she                           knows...                 He gets to his feet and he crosses to stand before her. So                 does Martin.                                       ETHAN                          Unt osupanet cah-nay Scar?

ETHAN                          You ask her!                                       MARTIN                          Look!

ETHAN                               (in Comanche)                          Nami.                 She looks gravely from Ethan to Martin. Then, with impassive                 face, she bends swiftly, picks up her blanket and walks away                 from them to choose her own sleeping place. The two men don t                 know what to make of it.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. CAMP - OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN -                 MORNING                 It is the same scene the following morning. The men are                 standing above where Look had bedded for the night, looking                 at the ground. Clearly marked on the hard ground is a crudely                 drawn arrow.                                       MARTIN                          Beats me how she could get that pony                           out o  camp without neither of us                           hearin  a thing...                                       ETHAN                          She ain t goin  back to her family,                           that s certain... not if she took                           off where the arrow points.                                       MARTIN                          Think she means for us to follow?                                       ETHAN                          How should I know... She s YOUR wife!                 He walks toward their horses, starts to saddle up.                 Martin follows.                                       MARTIN                          I think maybe we oughta...

And Ethan starts singing  Skip to My Lou  half under his                 breath. Martin gives him a sour side-glance and continues                 saddling.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 INT.

Jorgensen s pipe has gone out and he lights it.                                       LAURIE                          Maybe she left other signs for us to                           follow but we ll never know --  cause                           it snowed all day and all the next                           week... We were heading north, through                           the buffalo country when something                           happened that I ain t got straight                           in my own mind yet...

MARTIN S VOICE                          Ethan got a nice one on his first                           shot, but then he began killing one                           after another -- cows as well as                           bulls -- fast as he could fire and                           load...

MARTIN                          Ethan, quit it!                                       ETHAN                               (firing again)                          Nine...

Ethan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches Martin                 by surprise and fells him.                                       ETHAN                               (in a fury)                          Hunger! -- Empty bellies! That s the                           sense in it, you Cherokee!...                 He swings up his gun and fires again -- and again... as Martin                 stares at him from the ground.                 137-G                 EXT. THE HERD - LONG SHOT - THE STAMPEDE (COLO.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN AS BEFORE (PROCESS)                 The thunder of the hooves is receding and Ethan grimly lowers                 his rifle. Martin picks himself up -- still staring at Ethan                 as though at a madman. Ethan turns and looks at him.                                       ETHAN                          Least, THEY won t feed any Comanches                           this winter...

If you feel                           that sorry for your kinfolk, I m                           surprised you didn t take up with                           that squaw wife of yours...                 He whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead                 buffalo o.s. Martin looks after him with troubled expression.                 Suddenly he hears something, borne faint by the wind.                                       MARTIN                          ETHAN!                 Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound,                 is the distant blowing of a bugle.                                       MARTIN                          Listen!... Hear it?... There! Ain t                           that a bugle... and firing?                 Ethan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the                 distant crack of shots, from long miles off.                                       ETHAN                               (grimly)                          Just hope we ain t too late...                 And the two break and run for their horses.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 OMITTED                 EXT.

OFFICER                          We got two around that age...                                       MARTIN                               (eagerly)                          Where?                                       OFFICER                          You ll have to wait until we reach                           the agency... Fall in behind the                           column...                                       MARTIN                               (protestingly)                          But couldn t you...?                                       OFFICER                          Sorry...                               (shouting it)                          Keep the column moving!... Close                           ranks there!                 The officer spurs out to rejoin the column. Martin looks at                 Ethan, his face alive with hope. But Ethan is just looking                 stonily along the line of passing prisoners.                                                                     WIPE TO:                 EXT. THE NOKONI AGENCY - WIDE ANGLE - DAY                 The column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency                 (COLORADO FOOTAGE). We see the dead and wounded on travois;                 the agency Indians watching stoically; the prisoners -- some                 of them -- being herded into a chapel.                 INT. OFFICE OF NOKONI AGENCY - FULL SHOT - DAY                 The office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters.                 The GENERAL is being interviewed by two Eastern newspaper                 CORRESPONDENTS. At a table beyond is a telegrapher, sending                 out a report of the victory.                 A pot-bellied stove supplies heat and the General is warming                 his hands at it, intermittently. An adjutant is rather wearily                 filling out a long official form.                 The General, for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur                 and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well-known glory                 hunter of the Indian wars. He wears a colonel s straps, but                 insists upon his brevet rank.                                       GENERAL                          And it was clear to me the hostiles                           outnumbered us four to one... with                           all the advantage of terrain...                                       CORRESPONDENT                          Four to one! What did you do, general?                 Ethan and Martin enter, stand in the doorway.                                       GENERAL                               (impressively)                          Sir -- we charged!... Gentlemen --                           and I hope you will quote me -- I                           cannot say too much for the courage                           of the men who followed me into that                           Cheyenne camp...                                       ETHAN                               (blurting it)                          Cheyenne! What Cheyenne?                                       GENERAL                               (turning and staring)                          I beg your pardon?                                       ETHAN                          That camp you hit was Nawyecka                           Comanche... Chief Scar s bunch...                                       CORRESPONDENT                               (fascinated)                          Scar? What a wonderful name!...                                       GENERAL                               (to his aide)                          Are you getting this, Keefer?                                       CORRESPONDENT                               (to Ethan)                          How do you spell that word --                           Nawyecka?                 Ethan ignores him, still facing the General.                                       ETHAN                          My name s Edwards... I m looking for                           my niece... she was in that camp                           when you attacked...                                       GENERAL                               (uncertain)                          Well... I know there were some                           captives recovered...                                       MARTIN                               (bitterly)                          Four of  em dead... so we were told...                                       GENERAL                               (uncomfortably)                          Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered                           them as we developed the village...                                       ETHAN                          Are you sure they didn t die of                           carbine shots fired by a bunch o                            Yank bluebellies so scared they                           couldn t tell the difference between                           a Cheyenne and a Comanche?                                       GENERAL                          Keefer!... Put this man under arrest!                                       ETHAN                          That ll be the day...                               (scornfully)                           As we developed the village ...                           Next time you develop a village, hit                           it where the fightin  men are...                            You won t get any headlines for                           killin  squaws.                 Keefer coughs.                                       KEEFER                          Shall I show him the captives, sir?                                       GENERAL                          Just get him out of here!                                       KEEFER                          Yes sir...                               (he crosses to Ethan)                          This way...                 INT. THE CHAPEL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING TO DOOR -                AFTERNOON                 The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into                 the room -- then stops in manifest shock. Martin                 is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands                 Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in                 the room -- almost an animal sound.                 INT. THE CHAPEL - REVERSE SHOT - FULL                 It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without                 backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar.                 Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on                 boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures --                 at least two being the bodies of children.                 Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman                 with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian                 robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be                 no more than in her mid-thirties.                 She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed                 golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making                 the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the                 sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape.                 Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door.                 One has light hair, like Debbie s; the other brown hair. The                 afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light                 hair.                                       MARTIN                          Debbie?... DEBBIE?                 He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room.                 Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to                 side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the                 room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing                 the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but                 do not turn.                                       MARTIN                          Don t be scared, ma am...                 The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at                 them with frightened eyes.                                       KEEFER                          Just don t pay any attention to her...                 Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired                 girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder.                                       MARTIN                               (softly)                          Debbie?                 At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand,                 like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably                 a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her                 ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of                 her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.                                       GIRL                          Pabo-taibo!                               (White man!)                          The other girl has risen almost in                           the same instant -- but more out of                           fear. She is younger, but painted                           like the other. She moves to stand                           behind the savage one.                                       MARTIN                               (slowly)                          No... She s not...                                       ETHAN                          I ain t sure... Where s that doll?                 Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind.                 He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out                 to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it                 is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other                 girl laughs. Martin turns away and he s sick.                                       KEEFER                          Was your niece about their age?                                       ETHAN                          Not far from it...                                       KEEFER                          Hard to realize they re white, isn t                           it...                                       ETHAN                               (grimly)                          They re not white any more -- they re                           Comanche!... Let s see the bodies...                 Martin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow.                                       ETHAN                          I don t need you...                 Ethan and Keefer move away. As they do, the madwoman -- eyes                 fixed on the rag doll in Martin s hand -- begins creeping up                 behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer                 as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never                 see the dead. During this:                                       KEEFER                               (the dispassionate                                pro)                          I d like you to see them all... It                           might help us identify them... Shot                           in the head -- flash-burn range...                           The boy got his skull cracked...                           Here s the girl...                 Martin stiffens, waiting.                                       ETHAN                          No...                 Martin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the                 doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons.                 Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling                 the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can t                 take it. Ethan returns.                                       ETHAN                          Well, we only got the one lead --                          Scar... And where we begin to look,                           I don t know...                                       KEEFER                          There s one thing. We recovered a                           bushel of trinkets in that camp...                           cheap stuff... trade goods... Couldn t                           help noticing that most of it was                           Mexican... Maybe if you could talk                           to some of those Mexican traders                           along the border... What do they                           call themselves?                                       ETHAN                          Comancheros...                                       KEEFER                          That s the breed... Course it might                           take time.                                       ETHAN                          Time s running out... But I m obliged                           to you.                 They leave.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP -                 EVENING                 Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it                 by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead                 ashes of his pipe.  Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in                 his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking                 a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a                 corner of her apron.                                       LAURIE                          ...so we re setting out for New Mexico                           Territory in the morning... I am                           sorry I won t be back for Christmas                           again this year...                 She swallows hard, pauses a moment in her reading.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (quick sympathy)                          And you knittin  that muffler...                                       LAURIE                               (impatiently)                          What s the difference!                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Well, I just thought it would be a                           sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE                           get some good of it...                 She looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys                 Laurie. Laurie resumes her letter reading:                                       LAURIE                               (peering closely)                          There s a word crossed out... It                           looks like  I wish  or  I will ...                               (she gives up)                          Anyway...  I set pen aside in the                           hope you are enjoying good health                           and your folks the same... I remain,                           respectfully...                               (forlornly)                          yours truly, Martin Paulie.                  That s all there is. Not a cross on it. Laurie just looks at                 it. Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick                 in his back. He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and                 replaces them on the mantel.                                       JORGENSEN                          They never find that girl.                                       LAURIE                               (half to herself)                          Yours truly...                               (hotly)                          And he even has to write his full                           name... Martin Pauley... not even                           just Martie!...                               (she stands)                          I don t care if he never comes back!                 She heads for the front door.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                               (rising -- saying it                                without conviction)                          Now, Laurie!...                 Charlie hits the guitar a little stronger. Mrs. Jorgensen                 looks at him -- and the matchmaker is at work.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          Charlie, you ll stay for supper?...                            Now I won t take no for an answer.                                       CHARLIE                          Thought of saying  no  never crossed                           my mind, Miz Jorgensen... No place                           I d rather be than right here, right                           now.                 Mrs. Jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties. Laurie has                 opened the door and is staring out wistfully... and Charlie                 begins playing and singing a verse from  Skip to My Lou.                                        CHARLIE                               (singing)                          One old boot and a button shoe One                           old boot and a button shoe...                                                                     FADE OUT                 FADE IN                 EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN RIDING -                 DAY                 The search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single                 pack horse, are heading south through New Mexico.                 It is hot country.                 EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN -                DAY                 Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are                 the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do                 not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic,                 hard look about them both. The music theme segues into                 something livelier and Mexican as we -                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. A MEXICAN VILLAGE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY                 It is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe                 houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of                 faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the                 music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the                 street. Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without                 a saddle -- only a blanket pad. There is something familiar                 about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in.                 EXT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - DAY                 The two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes.                 Ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside.                 Martin pauses beside Ethan.                                       ETHAN                          Recognize it?                 Martin shakes his head. They start toward the cantina.                                       ETHAN                          There couldn t be two like that in                           all the world...                 INT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - DAY                 as Ethan and Martin enter. It is a dirt-floored room with a                 small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls.                 A pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. A                 couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes,                 slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to                 the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping                 a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic-                looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino                 game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper                 cigarette; she is barefoot. Behind the bar is the proprietor,                 dozing on his stool. Ethan takes a step into the room.                                       ETHAN                               (loudly)                          MOSE!.... MOSE HARPER?                 The proprietor awakens. The domino game is suspended in mid-                play. Estrella turns... and from beside Emilio, previously                 obscured by the man s back and the big charro hat, pokes the                 head of old Mose. Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers.                                       MOSE                          Ay-eh...?                 He is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes                 them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens                 and closes in words that won t come out. He grabs and shakes                 Ethan s arm, then Martin s.                                       ETHAN                          Leggo my arm... You look mangier  n                           ever.                                       MOSE                          Ain t been too good... No sir, not                           too good... Gettin  old, Ethan...                                       ETHAN                          You were born old...                                       PROPRIETOR                               (all smiles - as they                                head for the bar)                          Bienvenidos, senores...

PROPRIETOR                               (beaming)                          Y  par  el Viejo -- el vino del                           pais... tequila tambien!                 Martin puts his back to the bar, leans elbows on it and looks                 around.                 158A                 INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TOWARD ESTRELLA                 She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the                 musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table                 and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio                 is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored                 amusement.                 158B                 INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLE AT BAR                 Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself --                leaving Martin s glass empty.                                       MOSE                          I been helpin  ye, Ethan... I been                           lookin  all the time...                 Martin turns back to the bar to take his glass. He finds it                 empty.                                       MARTIN                               (to Ethan s back)                          Thanks for nothin ...                 He angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the                 bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to Estrella.                 Neither Ethan nor Mose seems aware of his going.                                       ETHAN                          Well, the reward still stands...

Given word?                                       ETHAN                               (impatiently)                          Told ya, didn t I?

Ethan stares at him. Mose nods his reaffirmation of it.                 Then Ethan s hand locks on the old man s shoulder.                                       ETHAN                          Who? Where is he... this man?                 Mose winces under the grip. He can t speak, but he looks                 past Ethan and he points. Ethan turns. Emilio swings his                 boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. He lets                 cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. Then he smiles.                                       EMILIO                          I am this man, senor... Emilio Gabriel                           Fernandez y Figueroa... at your                           service...

As the men study each other, Estrella begins her dance --                  and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a                 metronome. Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully                 pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to                 bring something better.                                       EMILIO                          Un otra!                 INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TO ESTRELLA                 He is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl                 hungrily. She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him                 and with unmistakable effect. He sloshes another drink into                 his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it.                 INT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DANCE                 Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar --                gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible                 conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins                 dropping gold pieces into Emilio s hand. Meanwhile, dance                 and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the                 tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily.                 Estrella s smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in                 her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded,                 and he sees what is going on. He starts for Martin s table                 just as Martin moves out to take the girl.                                       ETHAN                               (tolerantly)                          Come on, Don Juan... We re on our                           way...                 Martin tries to push him away, his eyes still on the girl.                                       MARTIN                               (thickly)                          Lemme alone...

Martin breaks free and squares off.                                       MARTIN                          Take yer hands off n me...

Estrella ranges herself alongside of Martin and slips an arm                 possessively through his.                                       ETHAN                               (a shrug)                          Suit yourself...

MARTIN                          Never heard of him...                                       ETHAN                          Cicatriz is Mex for Scar... an  he                           has a white girl in his tepee... Be                           seein  you...                 He turns and heads out. Emilio, who has come up behind him,                 gives Estrella a slight smile and bow.                                       EMILIO                          Buena suerte, Estrella... Hasta la                           vista.                 He follows Ethan. Estrella swings her body close to Martin                 and lets her arms slide around his neck.                                       ESTRELLA                               (softly)                          Tu quieres...?                 Martin blinks to clear away the fog of tequila and desire.                                       MARTIN                               (a bitter laugh)                          Sure... sure... Only not this year...                 He pulls her arms away and goes lurching after the others.                 Mose catches his arm.                                       MOSE                           Mind Ethan  bout my rockin  chair!                 Martin continues out and Mose stands there -- his head rockin                  as though he already were in his chair.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. (APPROACH TO THE NEEDLES MONUMENT) - A BROAD CANYON -                FULL SHOT - DAY                 A small pack train (nine or ten horses, six or seven men)                 winds through a canyon behind which we can see huge needles                 of rock: majestic, savage country. At the head of the column                 ride Ethan, Emilio, and Martin. Behind them come Emilio s                 cargadores -- lean, hard-bitten wiry little Mexicans. One                 leads a handsome palomino. The SOUND of the CASTANETS ECHOES                 in the musical theme.                 EXT. CANYON - MED.

ETHAN                          Medicine country, huh?

Ethan and Emilio both look in the direction of his glance.                 EXT. CANYON - FULL SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE - FROM BEHIND RIDERS -                 DAY                 They are turning a bend and now, ahead, we see a cordon of                 Comanches -- all armed, all quiet, all very menacing as they                 watch the approaching column. Emilio calls a greeting in                 Comanche. It gets no answer.                 EXT. CANYON - MOVING SHOT - THE COMANCHE FACES - DAY                 The CAMERA PICKS UP the faces in turn, as from the white                 men s viewpoint, as they ride slowly by.                 EXT. COMANCHE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - DAY                 One tepee stands apart from the other s -- Scar s. Beyond it                 are other tepees, the gathering of braves and some squaws,                 the drying racks for meat, etc. Emilio leads the way toward                 the central tepee. They dismount nearby and Emilio inclines                 his head toward the one tepee. Ethan and Martin brace                 themselves and wait. The flap of the tepee is closed.                                       MARTIN                               (gruffly)                          What are we waiting for?                 Emilio cautions him with a hand gesture.                 EXT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DAY                 The flap is thrust aside and SCAR steps out -- the same                 Comanche we had seen at the grave when Debbie was captured.                 He stands tall, arrogant, eyeing the white men with hard,                 implacable eyes. He has a robe gathered about him. Across                 his face is a scar.                                       EMILIO S VOICE                          Senores! This is Cicatriz!                 EXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY                 The white men s eyes are as hard as the Comanche s: this is                 the man they have long sought, the killer, the raper.                 They cannot mask the hatred they feel.                                       ETHAN                               (slowly... at last)                          Scar... It s plain to see where you                           got your name.                 Scar s hand moves to the scar on his face, and a finger runs                 along it.                                       SCAR                          Your name - Big Shoulders... His                           name - He Who Follows.                                       ETHAN                          You speak pretty good American for a                           Comanche... Someone teach you?                 It is a leading question and Scar knows it. He looks long at                 Ethan and the suggestion of a smile touches his lips.                 But he makes no direct answer. He looks instead to Emilio.                                       SCAR                               (in Comanche)                          Ah-we pabbo-tie-bo ee-kee-tay?

Emilio quickly turns and calls to one of his men. Emilio is                 worried.                                       EMILIO                               (sharply)                          Miguel... caballo -- aca!                 One of the Mexicans comes on the trot, leading in the                 palomino. Emilio makes a gesture -- giving it to Scar.                                       EMILIO                          Co-bay tabitz-chat.

Again that faintly contemptuous smile.                 He signals them to enter his tepee.                                       ETHAN                               (to Martin)                          Stay out here.                                       MARTIN                          Not likely.                 He follows Ethan into the tepee... and a worried Emilio goes                 along.                 INT. THE TEPEE - FULL SHOT                 A small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft of                 sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak.                 Two chunky squaws, who have been tending the fire or grinding                 corn in a rock pestle, scuttle to a side of the tepee. Two                 others, one half-grown and the other slightly taller, sit                 with their backs to the fire, huddled over some leather work                 or stitching. Both are shawled. As Scar enters, he barks a                 word to the squaws near the fire.                                       SCAR                          Pie-kay!

He sits on some robes, signs for them to sit opposite.                 Slowly they look around them.                 INT. THE TEPEE - REVERSE ANGLE - AS FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT -                TTE TWO OLDER SQUAWS                 They are sitting with heads averted, slightly profiled --                 but clearly Indian women, broad-faced, dark of hair and skin.                                       EMILIO S VOICE                          His sons are dead... So his wives                           sit on the honor side of his lodge.                 INT.

One of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it                 is another Indian face. The other does not turn.                 Scar leans in, blocking the view.                                       SCAR                          Two sons -- killed by white men...

The slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn t                 move. Scar glares.                                       SCAR                               (louder)                          MAYAH-KAY ZEE-EH!                 The girl gets to her feet. Ethan and Martin watch as, still                 with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from                 the tepee wall. It has several scalps on it, including one                 with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never                 takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring                 every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them,                 so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists.                 Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than                 the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the                 CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO:                 INT. THE TEPEE - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE                 As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant                 green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white                 and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME                 should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first                 clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.)                 Debbie s eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar s voice is heard:                                       SCAR                               (in Comanche)                          Pie-kay!                               (Go!)                 Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes                 back to her former place.                 INT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE                 Scar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin s eyes                 are wide and his breathing seems suspended. But Ethan is                 playing it like a poker player.                                       ETHAN                               (his voice controlled)                          I ve seen scalps before...                 Scar s eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from his                 shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting                 in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan                 had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide                 string. Scar touches it.                                       SCAR                          This before?                 Ethan smiles -- and he s still playing poker. He stands...                  and the others follow. Scar is puzzled.                                       ETHAN                               (to Emilio)                          I came to trade, not to admire his                           collection... Tell him we re going                           to pitch camp across the crick...                           Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow.                 Scar hasn t understood all of it. He scowls and looks at                 Emilio.                                       SCAR                               (in Comanche)                          Ee-sap!

He smiles slightly, and                 he nods his agreement.                                       SCAR                          Puetze!                 Martin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look                 swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can t help but                 pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap.                 EXT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - THE THREE MEN                 They emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not                 fast, not slow, and without a side glance. Scar emerges and                 looks after them -- glowering. A few other Comanches begin                 to gather near his tepee.

I                           wish to stay that way.                 They reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train,                 surrounded by suspicious Comanches.

SAND DUNES NEAR NEEDLES (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - LATE                 AFTERNOON                 Emilio is standing near his horse, talking to Ethan and                 Martin.                                       EMILIO                          You understand, senores... It is not                           that I am cobarde... cowardly...

EMILIO                          He knows you -- who you are -- and                           why you are here...

He fumbles for a pouch, holds it out to Ethan.                                       EMILIO                          Take it. I do not want blood money.                           Vaya con Dios!                 He digs spurs and rides out. Ethan turns and looks soberly                 at Martin. We hear the rest of the riders moving away.                 Ethan and Martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the                 creek where their horses are waiting.                 174-A                 EXT.

They look up.                 174-B                 EXT. SAND DUNE - DAY                 Debbie is silhouetted atop the dune, looking down at them.

She takes a                           frightened step back, as if to run.                                       MARTIN                          Debbie... Don t you remember me?

It takes                 Martin a moment to realize what he is about to do.                                       MARTIN                          Ethan -- NO!                 He moves quickly then to put himself between Ethan and the                 girl and in that instant there is the crack of a rifle.                 Ethan is hit in the leg. It goes out from under him. Martin                 swings and his gun is out and firing.                 174-D                 EXT. SAND CREEK - FULL SHOT - INCLUDING THE DUNES - DAY                 A mounted Comanche is on the crest of the dune above them --                rifle raised. Martin s first shot brings him down the dune                 in a spectacular horse-and-man fall. Debbie goes running                 like a deer up the creek, away from Martin; in the same                 instant we hear the angry yells of distant Comanches charging                 from the far left. Martin turns to see Debbie running away.                                       MARTIN                          Debbie! WAIT!                 Ethan is on his feet now and limping frantically toward their                 horses. He shoves Martin ahead of him.                                       ETHAN                               (angrily)                          Never mind her! MOVE!                 They mount and take off, just as the vanguard of the attacking                 Comanches swings around a point of rock and comes charging                 toward the creek.                 EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON                 as Ethan and Martin race their horses from the creek area                 and down a long incline, as -- from the heights above -- a                 dozen or more Comanches, led by Scar, come tearing after                 them.                 175-A                 EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - MOVING - DAY                 Ethan is swaying in his saddle, just barely hanging on, as                 Martin races up behind him -- driving Ethan s horse along.                 They swing past a huge outcrop of rock and go tearing along                 a vaulting wall of stone. Their hoofbeats and those of the                 pursuers bounce and echo off the canyon walls, and bullets                 whine and ricochet.                 175-B                 EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - FULL MOVING SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN -                DAY                 They swing around giant boulders, up-ended like pancakes.                 Ethan is lurching almost out of the saddle, barely conscious.                 Martin spots the cave -- ahead -- and drives his mount and                 Ethan s toward it.                 175-C                 EXT. THE CAVE (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - THE TWO - DAY                 Martin pulls his horse in and swings off just as Ethan slides                 from his saddle. He runs toward one of the huge boulders,                 crouches and starts firing.                 175-D                 EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE ON THE COMANCHES - DAY                 The Comanches are spread out but coming on fast. One goes                 down under Martin s fire.... another is hit in the arm. He                 pulls up and the other Comanches wheel away from the hidden                 marksman.                 175-E                 EXT. THE CAVE - FULL SHOT - MARTIN AND ETHAN                 Martin runs back from his firing post toward where Ethan has                 fallen.                                       ETHAN                               (angrily)                          Go on! Get out of here while you                           can...

He starts dragging himself                 to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle                 scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their                 horses away. Then he too runs for the shelter of the cave.                 175-F                 EXT. THE CANYON - ANGLING FROM BEHIND MARTIN AND ETHAN                 Both men are crouching, rifles ready. In the distance we see                 their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches.                 Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave --                 moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry.                 Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over                 their horses  necks and clear out of there. Ethan looks grimly                 at Martin.                                       ETHAN                          They ll be back...                                       MARTIN                          We won t be here... Come on!                 He gets an arm under Ethan and hauls him to his feet.

THE GAP IN THE CLIFF - PANNING SHOT - SUNSET                 CAMERA PANS from the top of the rock chimney to where Martin                 is snaking his way through, carrying newly-filled water                 canteens. He stands there, listening and looking back the                 way he has come; and then, satisfied there has been no                 pursuit, he continues away.                 OMITTED                 INT. THE CAVE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN - HALF-LIGHT                 Ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with                 some boughs. He is half delirious. A small fire is burning.                 Martin enters carrying the canteens. He looks                 unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire,                 takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. Ethan gasps, mumbles                 and then a word comes clear.                                       ETHAN                          Martha... Martha!                 Martin stares at him -- and now, perhaps for the first time,                 he is fitting pieces into the jig-saw puzzle. He shifts closer                 to Ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet.                 Ethan opens his eyes and looks at him.                                       MARTIN                          I gotta open that leg and let the                           poison out...                 He poises the knife.                                       ETHAN                          Wait...                 He fumbles in his shirt pocket, brings out a greasy folded                 piece of paper.                                       ETHAN                          Just in case... Read it.                 Martin sets the knife down, takes the paper, opens it and                 slowly reads:                                       MARTIN                           I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound                           mind and without any blood kin, do                           hereby bequeath all my property of                           any kind to Martin Pauley...

She s                           nothin  now but a...                 Martin shoves him back onto the ground.                                       MARTIN                               (a shout)                          Shut your dirty mouth!                 He gets to his feet, trembling, and stands looking down at                 Ethan, his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his                 eyes. Then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket.                 He picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man.                                       MARTIN                               (slowly)                          I hope you die!                 And he kneels again to open the wound.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY                 Martin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in                 which, lashed by vines and some clothing, is the unconscious                 figure of Ethan.                 CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - MARTIN - DAY                 Eyes shadowed, whiskered, drawn -- he is an implacable figure                 as he drags the weary miles home. He hears a groan from Ethan                 o.s. He barely lets his eyes drift to the sound. He doesn t                 stop.                 CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - ETHAN IN THE TRAVOIS - DAY                 We see he is delirious, lips parched, strapped to the poles.                 The travois jolts over the ground. As he passes out of frame,                 the CAMERA HOLDS on the marks of the travois poles scraping                 across the desert.

Fiddler and banjo-player are playing                 a lively square dance for one or two sets of dancers --                 ranchers, their wives and daughters. Laurie is not in                 evidence. At the far end of the room is a table with a punch                 bowl set up and a cluster of men and women about.                 Jorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new                 arrivals. Leading them into the room is Captain the Reverend                 Sam Clayton, with a bulky oil-skin package under his arm.                 With him is Charlie MacCorry, dressed in his best black suit                 and scrubbed until he looks raw.                 Behind them come three or four other competent-looking men --                 Rangers all of them.                                       JORGENSEN                               (shouting)                          They re here, mama... Come in, come                           in...                 INT. JORGENSEN HOME - FULL SHOT - FAVORING GROUP AT DOOR                 Clayton waits for Charlie to come abreast, then hits him on                 the back and drives him inside.

Mrs. Jorgensen smiles and playfully pushes him toward the                 guests.                                       MRS. JORGENSEN                          You ll see her soon enough...                 Clayton -- and the other Rangers -- have been hanging gunbelts                 on pegs along the wall. Now he shakes out his parcel --                 disclosing a green-black frock coat.

We can hear the lively music                 of the square dance. As Jorgensen opens the door and sets                 out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and                 on it are Martin and Ethan. Jorgensen at first doesn t                 recognize them.                                       JORGENSEN                               (hailing them)                          Hi!... You re late... hurry...                 And then he sees who they are, and his jaw drops.                                       JORGENSEN                               (staring)                          Ethan... Martie... No, don t get                           down! ...You can t come in!

He says it as though that explains everything.                                       ETHAN                          What s that got to do with us?

Martin throws the reins aside and jumps out. Jorgensen grabs                 his arm.                                       JORGENSEN                          Wait! Don t you hear me!

Ethan meanwhile has climbed stiffly                 down, slightly favoring his leg.                                       JORGENSEN                          Quick... hide in the barn, Ethan...                                       ETHAN                          Hide? Why would I?                 He brushes past the little man and heads for the door.                 INT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - ANGLING FROM BEHIND ETHAN                 as he enters, with Jorgensen at his heels. For a moment, as                 he stands there, the party breezes on. Then first one, then                 another sees him. They gape, and the music falters and stops.                 Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the                 room. Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes                 a very bad job of it.                                       JORGENSEN                          Look everybody...

And the faces of both men                 are grim.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT.

And then it opens and Laurie is inside,                 holding a lamp. She is in her bridal gown and very obviously                 trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under.

He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn                 clothing.                                       MARTIN                          I... I wrote you a letter... Reckon                           you didn t get it...                                       LAURIE                               (setting the lamp                                down)                          One letter in five years... I read                           it till the paper dried up and the                           writing faded out...                                       MARTIN                          It wasn t much of a letter...                                       LAURIE                          No, it wasn t... You mighta said you                           loved me... You mighta asked me to                           wait... At least that d have been                           something...                                       MARTIN                          But I allus loved you... You know                           that, without my sayin  it... I                           couldn t bring myself to ask you to                           wait... the little I had... not                           knowin  how much longer until we                           found Debbie...                                       LAURIE                               (breaking)                          It isn t fair...                 She sinks onto the bench.                                       LAURIE                               (sobbing)                          It isn t fair, Martin Pauley, and                           you know it!                 She begins to cry, very softly. He is beside her and his arm                 goes around her shoulder comfortingly.                                       MARTIN                          Don t cry, Laurie... I understand                           how it is... I ll just go  way...                                       LAURIE                               (spinning on him)                          You do and I ll die, Martie... I                           will! I ll just die!                 And they are kissing through her tears when the outer door                 is flung open by Charlie MacCorry. They part as he glares.                                       CHARLIE                          I ll thank you to leave the room,                           Laurie.                 Martin stares at him, then at her.                                       MARTIN                               (incredulous)                          Charlie MacCorry!... You weren t                           fixin  to marry HIM??                                       CHARLIE                          She sure is!... An  don t think your                           comin  back is goin  to change it!                                       MARTIN                          As to that, I don t know, Charlie...                           We hadn t got around to talkin                            marriage...                                       CHARLIE                          What right you got to be talkin                            marriage to any decent woman...                                       MARTIN                               (angrily)                          If you re talkin  about that crazy                           murder charge...                                       CHARLIE                          AND other things... Mebbe you thought                           you was gettin  away with being                           comical about that Indian wife you                           took... I bet she wasn t the first                           squaw you...                 Martin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter. He side-                steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the                 wall. Laurie runs between them.                                       LAURIE                          Stop it! Both of you... I won t have                           any fighting in this house.                 Martin gently brushes her aside.                                       MARTIN                          It s all right... Charlie, let s                           move outside.                                       CHARLIE                          I ain t wearing no gun.                 Martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt. The men head outside                 as Laurie runs to get help.                 EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - BREEZEWAY                 Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside.                 Martin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded                 by Charlie s left and countered with a crisp right that puts                 Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this                 time, and comes in at a crouch; he s fighting like an Indian,                 not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now                 at a run.                                       CLAYTON                               (yelling)                          Sergeant MacCorry!                 Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs                 and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though                 there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into                 Clayton s arms.                                       CLAYTON                          Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?                                       CHARLIE                               (regaining his balance)                          No sir... pleasure.                                       CLAYTON                          In that case, give the boys room...                 Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his                 right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin                 recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat.                 He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks                 and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws                 Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is                 a wrestler against a boxer.                                       CLAYTON                          Fight fair, son... Use your fists!                                       ETHAN                               (drily)                          Comanches don t use their fists,                           reverend... Let  em alone...                 Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling -- now                 trying to imitate Martin s crouch. Suddenly Martin feints a                 right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the                 order of business. Charlie staggers and Martin follows up                 with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both                 legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back                 so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under                 other circumstances -- be neatly and expeditiously scalped.                 With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife. He                 looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.                                       MARTIN                          Could scalp him... but I ll just                           count coup!                 With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to                 grab a lock of Charlie s hair and neatly snip it off.                 He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet --                 easing the tortured arms. Clayton goes to Charlie s side.                 Laurie moves to Martin s side.                                       CLAYTON                          You all right, sergeant?                                       CHARLIE                          Dunno... Seems so.                                       CLAYTON                          Well, go get cleaned up and we ll                           proceed with the weddin ...                 Charlie frowns and looks off at where Laurie and Martin are                 standing.                                       CHARLIE                          Ain t goin  to be any weddin  -- not                           till we get a few things cleared up                            round here...                 He walks rather unsteadily away leaving a thunderstruck                 assembly, murmurous with surprise.                                                                     WIPE TO:                 INT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                 The last of the wedding guests is leaving: Ed Nesby carrying                 his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller                 children preceding him out the door.                 The Jorgensens stand by -- trying to put a good face on the                 wedding debacle. Charlie MacCorry is sitting dejectedly,                 studying a spot on the floor. Ethan is at the mantel. Laurie                 is in her room -- presumably changing out of her wedding                 gown. Martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip. Clayton,                 still in his clerical coat, is near the door.                                       NESBY                               (a grin)                          Well... it was a nice weddin  party...                            considerin  no one got married...                            Night.                                       JORGENSEN                          Good night, Ed...                 Mrs. Jorgensen puts her handkerchief to her eyes -- letting                 down now that the guests have gone. Jorgensen crosses to                 her, pats her sympathetically.                                       JORGENSEN                          Now, mamma!...                 He leads her away. Clayton faces Ethan.                                       CLAYTON                          I got to ask you and Martin to ride                           to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.                                       ETHAN                          This an invite to a necktie party,                           Reverend?                                       CLAYTON                          Captain... Nope, wouldn t say that...                           Likely you had your reasons for                           killin  Futterman... Probably needed                           killin ... I m speaking as a ranger                           now, not as a reverend... Fact that                           all three was shot in the back is                           the only thing that s raised some                           question -- that and a missin  gold                           piece known to have been on him just                           prior to his demise.                 Ethan casually reaches into his pocket, takes out a gold                 coin and spins it.                                       ETHAN                               (casually)                          That so?                 Martin crosses to confront Clayton.                                       MARTIN                          I ain t goin  to Austin, Reverend.                 Charlie gets to his feet and he has his gun in his hand.                                       CHARLIE                          You re goin  if the captain says                           you re goin ...                                       CLAYTON                          Now, now... let s not grow                           disputatious...                 Fast hoofbeats sound o.s. -- signalling the approach of a                 four-man cavalry detail.                                       CLAYTON                               (turning)                          What s that? More company?                 He and Jorgensen head for the door.                                       CLAYTON                          Kinda late getting here, aren t they?                 A voice hails from outside.                                       LIEUTENANT S VOICE                          Hello there! Captain Clayton?                 INT. - EXT. JORGENSEN HOUSE - ANGLE AT DOOR - NIGHT                 Clayton stands in the opened doorway, Jorgensen behind him,                 looking out. Drawn up outside is the four-man cavalry detail,                 led by a young and very crisp LIEUTENANT. We may or may not                 see the sixth man, slouched over his horse. The Lieutenant                 swings off and crosses.                                       LIEUTENANT                          Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?                                       CLAYTON                          I m Clayton.                 The Lieutenant gapes at Clayton s ministerial coat.                                       LIEUTENANT                               (doubtfully)                          You re Captain Clayton?...                 Ethan chuckles, to Clayton s very obvious annoyance.                                       LIEUTENANT                               (recovering, he salutes)                          Colonel Greenhill s compliments,                           sir.

We ve received information                           about a band of Comanches under a                           chief named Scar...                                       ETHAN                          What information?                                       LIEUTENANT                          That maybe he s not far from here --                          holed up somewhere, waiting his chance                           to get back over the border... He                           raided north about a month ago...                           ran into more army than he bargained                           for... Now he s running for cover,                           for keeps this time...                                       CLAYTON                          And what makes you think he s in                           this territory?                                       LIEUTENANT                          Yesterday, one of our patrols picked                           up a man claims he was a prisoner                           with Scar till only two days ago...                           He talks crazy but I brought him                           along... Says he lives here... keeps                           mentioning a rocking chair.                                       ETHAN                               (half to himself)                          Mose...                 And then he is striding to the door, calling it:                                       ETHAN                          MOSE!

And the old man totters in, half-supported by a trooper --                hollow-eyed, weak, almost delirious.

She tries to lead him away, but Ethan shoves her aside and                 grips the old man by his arms.                                       ETHAN                          Mose... try to remember!... You were                           in Scar s camp...                                       MOSE                          Ay-he...

She leads him away, at last to his rocker by the fire.                 During this, Ethan and Clayton have been mulling Mose s                 answer.                                       ETHAN                               (blankly)                          Seven Fingers?                                       LIEUTENANT                          That s what he told us... but there s                           no such place on the maps.                                       MARTIN                          Wait a minute!

Martin s hands go to his side -- recalling where                 he left his guns.                                       MARTIN                          My guns...                 He heads for the inner door to the grandmother room.                 INT. THE GRANDMOTHER ROOM - FULL SHOT                 as Martin enters and crosses to where he had dropped his                 gunbelt. Even before he reaches it, Laurie is in the room --                 closing the door after her.                                       LAURIE                          Martie... don t go!

MARTIN                          Only if I m dead!                 He strides out past her.                 INT. THE KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT                 as Martin re-enters. Ethan and Sam are waiting. Martin looks                 hard at Ethan.                                       CLAYTON                          You ready?

As they stride out,                                                                      CUT TO:                 204-A                 INT. JORGENSEN HOUSE - GRANDMOTHER ROOM - CLOSE SHOT -                 LAURIE - NIGHT                 as she stands at the window, in her bridal gown, and sadly                 watches Martin again going away. Softly the score reprises --                 sadly now --  Skip to My Lou.                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. MESA COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - THE RANGERS - DAWN LIGHT                 A file of eighteen men and horses -- Rangers -- is walking                 under the shoulder of a mesa, keeping well below the skyline.                 FULL SHOT - THE FILE OF RANGERS - DAWN LIGHT                 They pass CAMERA one by one -- Sam Clayton in the lead, Martin                 behind him leading two horses, then the others -- grim-                looking, capable men of varying ages; some with long drooping                 mustaches, some in need of shaves, some chawing tobacco.                 CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT                 He is lying prone, his hat off, squinting down into a long                 reach of desert canyon at the Comanche encampment -- with                 tepees set up, a thin wisp of smoke rising from a fire, the                 horse herd penned in a draw cut off by an improvised corral                 of rawhide ropes.                 EXT. THE COMANCHE ENCAMPMENT - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - DAWN LIGHT                 The camp is sleeping. A dog yaps shrilly. One of the tepee                 flaps opens and Scar steps out. He picks up a stone or a                 chunk of wood and throws it. The dog yelps and runs off.                 Scar s air is troubled, suspicious. He heads for the horse                 herd. The camp sleeps on.                 CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT                 His face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction. He looks back                 along the trail as faintly we hear the approach of the Ranger                 company. Then he squirms back, retrieving his hat.                 FULL SHOT - HEAD OF RANGER COLUMN - DAWN LIGHT                 Sam, seeing Ethan in the near distance, raises his hand in a                 signal for halt and waits. Ethan scrambles down the trail to                 join him. He takes the reins of his horse from Martin.                                       ETHAN                          We can get within 500 yards... there s                           a hogback to the south.                                       CLAYTON                          How many, would you say?                                       ETHAN                               (drily)                          Enough to go around... I d say about                           a dozen apiece... Mount  em up!                 He moves as though to mount, but Martin steps forward.                                       MARTIN                          Wait! We go chargin  in, they ll                           kill her... and you know it.                                       ETHAN                               (calmly)                          It s what I m countin  on.                 Sam stares at him, but Martin isn t surprised.                                       MARTIN                          I know you are... Only it ain t goin                            to be that way... she s alive...                                       ETHAN                          Livin  with Comanches ain t bein                            alive...                                       MARTIN                               (same tone)                          She s alive... Better she s alive                           and livin  with Comanches than her                           brains bashed out...                                       CLAYTON                          Now son, it s a bitter thing to say,                           but there s more than your sister at                           stake here.                                       ETHAN                          There sure is! I m going to tell you                           somethin ... I wasn t going to speak                           of it... But I ll tell you now.  Did                           you notice them scalps strung on                           Scar s lance?                                       (MARTIN NODS)                          Did you see the third scalp from the                           point of the lance? Long... wavy                           hair...                                       MARTIN                          I saw it... And don t try to tell me                           it was Aunt Martha s or Lucy s...                                       ETHAN                          You don t remember it, but I remember.                           That was your mother s scalp!                 Martin stares, quick disbelief in his eyes. But Ethan s eyes                 hold his and there is no doubting the truth in them.                                       ETHAN                          I didn t want to tell you... but                           maybe it s your right to know.                                       CLAYTON                               (quietly)                          Now mount up, son...                 Sam puts his hand on Martin s elbow -- as though to turn him                 to his duty. But Martin jerks the arm away.                                       MARTIN                          It don t change it... All I m askin                            is a chance to sneak in there... an                            try to get her out before you come                           chargin  in.                                       CLAYTON                          What if you re caught?                                       MARTIN                          It won t tell  em anything, will it!                           Just a man alone...                                       ETHAN                          I say NO!                                       CLAYTON                          Go ahead, son... But at the first                           alarm, we re comin  in -- and we                           ain t goin  to have time to pick and                           choose our targets when we do...                 Ethan looks long and hard at Martin, then reaches into his                 shirt for the folded, dirty, dog-eared paper that was his                 will. Slowly he tears it into shreds.                                       ETHAN                          It s your funeral...                 Martin squats and starts pulling off his boots. He glances                 up as Charlie MacCorry comes over, an Indian blanket in his                 hands. He tosses it onto Martin s shoulder.                                       CHARLIE                          Here... you fight like a Comanch...                           Maybe this ll help ya pass as one.                 Then he grins and extends his hand. Martin takes it -- and                 they shake as Charlie pulls him to his feet. Martin drops                 his hat, and then -- at a crouching run -- he heads for the                 distant Comanche camp.                 FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND CLAYTON AND ETHAN, TOWARD MARTIN                 as he runs downslope under the shelter of the hogback toward                 the unseen camp. Clayton waves an arm at his men and starts                 leading out -- in a somewhat different direction.                 FULL SHOT - THE RANGERS, FAVORING CLAYTON AND ETHAN                 They are leading their horses down the slope, still under                 the lee of the butte, when two riders are seen approaching                 at a fast gallop -- Lt. Greenhill and his courier. (The latter                 is a bugler).                                       CLAYTON                          What in...?                                       GREENHILL                               (calling -- still                                distant)                          Captain Clayton... Captain!                 Sam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to Greenhill                 to shut up. Greenhill pulls to a canter, puzzled, and rides                 in.                                       CLAYTON                               (exploding)                          Go on! Whyn t you have your bugler                           sound the charge while you re at                           it??                                       GREENHILL                               (blankly)                          Sir?                                       CLAYTON                          Never mind... Your pa know you re                           out here?                                       GREENHILL                          Yes, sir... Troop s about ten miles                           back... The Colonel sent me looking                           for you...                                       CLAYTON                               (dismissing him)                          Well you found me... Good work, son...                           Good work.                 He starts away. Greenhill follows.                                       GREENHILL                          If there s anything I can do, sir...                                       CLAYTON                               (under his breath)                          God forbid... No, son, you flog on                           back and tell your pa where we re                           at... and where he s at...                                       GREENHILL                          But he knows THAT, sir... Can t I                           stay, sir?                                       CLAYTON                               (reluctantly)                          All right... But keep your eye on                           me, boy... I m the hard case you re                           up against here -- not these childish                           savages... If you don t hear me first                           time I holler, you better read my                           mind... I don t aim to raise no two                           hollers on any subject at hand...                                       GREENHILL                          Yes, sir...                 He whips out his sabre -- to the imminent peril of Captain                 Sam who quickly shifts out of the way.                                       CLAYTON                          Watch that knife, boy!                 Then Sam continues away and the Rangers after him.                 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF COMANCHE CAMP - FULL SHOT - DAWN LIGHT                 Martin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The                 camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind                 the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp,                 dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A                 dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking.                 EXT. THE HORSE HERD - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SCAR                 He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines.                 In the near distance the dog s barking is heard -- shrill,                 insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air                 suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs.                                       COMANCHE                          Tahbo.                               (A rabbit.)                 Scar isn t satisfied but returns to his work.                 EXT. THE COMANCHE CAMP - ANGLE FAVORING SCAR S TEPEE PAST                 MARTIN                 He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct                 decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for                 better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie s blanket around                 him and begins walking to the tepee.                 EXT. THE LEE OF THE HOGBACK OR RISE - FULL SHOT - THE                 RANGERS                 The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their                 sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along                 the line of men, then mounts his horse.                                       CLAYTON                          The State of Texas is payin  you                           boys $12 a month. Here s your chance                           to earn it... Now I don t want any                           foolin  around after scalps. We ain t                           got the time... Yankee cavalry s on                           its way here to set those Comanches                           free... We gotta beat  em to it --                           our way... Now mount an  guide center                           on young Greenhill here. Son, you                           just follow me... And WATCH THAT                           KNIFE!                 The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously                 flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton.                 EXT. SCAR S TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN                 Martin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around,                 then strides in.                 INT. SCAR S TEPEE                 as Martin enters. One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar                 has slept. Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two                 squaws. Two other figures -- one being Debbie s -- sleep in                 robes. Martin s eyes go to Scar s place and then rove slowly                 and hold on:                 INT. TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE                 She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair.                 Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder,                 to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin                 quickly claps a hand over his mouth.                 Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away.                                       MARTIN                               (a hoarse whisper)                          Debbie... don t!                 And then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets                 go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other                 squaws wake -- begin squawking.                                       MARTIN                               (grimly)                          I m takin  you whether you want to                           or not...                 Debbie sees something beyond him. Her eyes widen.                                       DEBBIE                               (a scream)                          MARTIN!                 INT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER                 P.O.V. - SCAR                 He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the                 grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife                 in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the                 other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.                 INT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT                 Martin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer                 twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps                 in, Martin s gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet,                 catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling                 her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the                 awakening of the camp.                 EXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP                 They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes                 bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs                 his hat and bows his head.                                       CLAYTON                          For these Thy gifts which we are                           about to receive...                               (donning his hat, he                                turns to the bugler)                          Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us                           Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!                 And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell                 is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge                 as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a                 West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre                 at the  charge.                  FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE                 In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice                 that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill s                 saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding,                 the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they                 did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their                 teeth, guns in their fists.                 EXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT                 Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their                 horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in.  The bark of                 hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have                 never been up against such marksmen. One charging Ranger                 rides down a tepee. Another, with two guns drawn, scores a                 running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite                 sides of his fast-running horse. A dodging Comanche screams                 as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him                 sprawling into the embers of the campfire.                 EXT. SCAR S TEPEE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN                 He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche                 crouched near the tepee. The charge races past him. Ethan                 swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and                 glares. A squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised,                 but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep. He turns                 and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes,                 seeing what he has been looking for:                 EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - LONG SHOT - ETHAN S P.O.V.                 Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along,                 while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are                 about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses                 are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.                 EXT. SCAR S TEPEE - FULL SHOT                 Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar s tepee.                 In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers,                 regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the                 Comanche horse herd.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND DEBBIE                 Martin hears Ethan s horse riding down at them; he turns,                 and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away.                                       MARTIN                          No, Ethan! NO!                 He goes running into the path of Ethan s horse.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN                 as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight                 the horse to a stop. Ethan swings on him -- once, twice --                 and Martin is knocked sprawling. Ethan rides on, relentlessly.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - DEBBIE AND ETHAN                 She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman.                 Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse                 goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust.                 Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and                 then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward                 her.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - ETHAN AND DEBBIE                 Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the                 foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground                 and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his                 gun. The hammer goes back.                                       ETHAN                               (quietly)                          I m sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...                 The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the                 gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie s face -- the eyes gazing                 fearlessly, innocently into Ethan s. We HOLD for a long moment                 and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks                 over to her.                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN                 He looks down at her.                                       ETHAN                               (softly)                          You sure favor your mother...                 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO                 He extends his hand to her. She takes it and he helps her to                 her feet. And then she is against his chest and his arm goes                 protectingly about her. They are standing that way when Martin                 stumbles up -- and stares.                                                                     WIPE TO:                 233-A                 EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - WIDE ANGLE - DAY                 The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse,                 each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the                 fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley                 with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing                 in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar                 we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge:                 sign of the approach of Greenhill s troop.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - FAVORING CLAYTON                 It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of                 face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over                 his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled                 red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling,                 applying some crude first aid to Sam s rump. Beyond them                 some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks                 up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler                 ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.                                       COLONEL                          Clayton, if you were in my command                           I d have you courtmartialed for this!                                       CLAYTON                               (angrily, to MacCorry)                          Hurry it up!                                       COLONEL                          What s the matter, sir... You wounded?                            What is it, Sergeant -- a bullet or                           an arrow?                 Charlie just gapes, but Clayton -- grim-lipped -- bends a                 meaningful glare on someone off. Greenhill looks that way.                 EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - LT. GREENHILL                 He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as                 miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It                 could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.                 EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP                 Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry s hand away and grabs for his                 pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three                 figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding                 Debbie s hand. And Sam s face is split by a grin as he tucks                 his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MOSE HARPER -                AFTERNOON                 He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and                 stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the                 clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later                 Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading                 his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing                 the distant horsemen.  He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And                 then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first,                 then with dawning realization.                 Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect...                  and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.                 CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE                 The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the                 hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the                 still unseen but nearing horsemen.                 FULL SHOT - THE GROUP                 Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm                 supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside                 them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the                 girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning                 her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie                 looks then at Martin. He doesn t know whether to smile or                 not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps                 onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she                 kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to                 take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he                 rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.
