Then  The Guests  listed in alphabetical                 order of all the actors playing guests. After the actors                  names, we...                 FADE UP ON A WALL                 The camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards                 from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C.,  Wish You                 Were Here  from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches,                 etc....                 The camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s                 hotel, the  Mon Signor,  in its heyday, with a full staff of                 30 people posed on the lawn in front.                 An old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:                                       VOICE-OVER                          There used to be a staff of fifty in                           this place. I m the only one left                           from those days. It all comes down                           to one sap: the night-shift bellhop,                           that s me. What the hell is a bellhop?                           You know where the name comes from?                               (silence)                          Of course not... It s so simple it s                           stupid. They ring a bell and you                           hop. You hop to front and center. No                           heroes in this line, kid. Just men                           doing a job. No questions asked,                           none answered. I try to keep it                           simple, kid, not too personal...                 Another voice of a young man interrupts.                                       TED                          You met any of those old stars?                                       THE OLD GUY                          Stars! Are you kidding me? I took                           Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for                           Christ s sakes. I taught Shirley                           Temple how to roller-skate. I saw                           Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three                           cheese sandwiches right on the spot                           you re sitting, kid. What did you                           say your name was?                                       TED                          Ted.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used                           to come down at night and doze off                           in the kitchen. She liked the sound                           of the fans out back spinning around.                           Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol                           Flynn used to call me  Alibi.  You ll                           pick up a few stories yourself, kid.                                       TED                          I don t think so, not like yours.                                       THE OLD GUY                          What do you think a star does when                           he goes to the bathroom, kid?                                       TED                          Beats me.                                       THE OLD GUY                          He pulls his pants down and takes a                           crap just like you and me. Take my                           word for it.                 A wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with                 a lip print on it signed  Marilyn.  The camera pulls back to                 reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a                 small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is                 dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop s cap on. He                 looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a                 young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The                 old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Camacho!                                       TED                          Who?                                       THE OLD GUY                          The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar,                           wrapped in Miami. I get a box of                           them every Christmas from the chairman                           of the board. I think he sends them                           to me to keep my mouth shut. It s                           tough not to get a little personal                           in this business.                 The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at                 his cap, lost in thought.                                       TED                          What do you mean?                 The old guy passes the cap over to Ted.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Put it on.                 Ted puts the cap on.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Frankly, you look stupid... like the                           Philip Morris guy. I can t believe I                           wore that thing for fifty years. You                           keep it.                 The Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on.                 Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old                 straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the                 door.

You can tell that at                 one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda.                 It s also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast-                talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty --                 stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in                 hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the                 front door. Betty sees him.                                       BETTY                          Sam! Hey, Sam, wait a minute!                 The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around.                                       THE OLD GUY                          What?                 Betty comes from behind the desk.                                       BETTY                          I just want to say good-bye.                                       THE OLD GUY                          Who are you?

The only reason I refer                           to it as a variable is that he s a                           movie star. Ya never know about movie                           stars.

Two, that s                           not a fair price. You re taking                           advantage of the situation. Twenty                           bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair                           price.                                       TED                          Yeah, but what you re doin  to me                           ain t fair. And, you are completely                           and totally taking advantage of me                           and your position. So fifty bucks is                           the perfect price.                 Betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.                                       BETTY                          Okay, but don t be a pussy. You don t                           bother me unless it s an emergency.                           In fact, for fifty bucks, you better                           not call me unless the fuckin                            building s burning down.                 She gives him the money.                                       BETTY                          Get ready to take the desk.                 Betty leaves.                 Ted sits in the chair, takes another drink, and prepares                 himself for the night.                 FADE TO BLACK                 STORY TITLE CARD:                                           ROOM 321                                        STRANGE BREW                  FADE IN:                 EXT. THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK                 Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a                 taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is                 a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to                 see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess).                 She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and                 is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.                 Ted takes Athena s luggage onto his cart. But one item in a                 woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is                 concerned as he attempts to lift it.                                       ATHENA                          Pleeze be careful -- my God. You                           have no idea...                 Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely                 heavy bag onto the cart. Athena tips the cab driver, stingily.                 The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed                 with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put                 this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at                 Ted, who is out of breath.                                       ATHENA                          I m usually a good tipper, but this                           one -- this cab driver -- he had                           green all around him. I don t like                           that in a man.                 Ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.                                       TED                          Green? Is that bad? Like you read                           auras or something like that?                                       ATHENA                          Something like that.                                       TED                          Yeah, well what color are you seein                            around me... how s the tip lookin?                                       ATHENA                          I see purple... in your face, and...                 As if she can t help herself, Athena s eyes are strangely                 drawn to his crotch.                 She frowns, confused by this impulse. Ted appears to be                 charmingly oblivious.                 Athena looks back into his face.                                       ATHENA                          ...you re okay.                 Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the  purple  in                 it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his                 crotch and giving her a confused side glance.                 INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK                 Ted shifts hats to check the girl in. He checks her                 reservation.                                       ATHENA                          Athena Z.                                       TED                               (scratching his head --                               weird name, okay)                          You re booked in the Honeymoon Suite --                          just one night? With all this luggage?                                       ATHENA                          I will only need to stay till sunrise.                                       TED                          Okay... and how will you be paying?                                       ATHENA                          With gold.                 He looks at this wacky Gypsy chick numbly -- she pulls out                 her Gold Card and smiles.                 EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK                 The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor.                 Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her                 room.                 AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR                 Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In                 the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids                 poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms                 beyond the still hot tub.                 Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in                 front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of                 a little Cupid and mumbles,  Perfect.                  Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed,                 she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance                 wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.                                       ATHENA                          Well -- the other bag -- I need it.                                       TED                          Right.                 He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He                 laughs sickly.                                       TED                          What the hell you got in here, lady?                           Nuclear weapons?                 She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the                 bag.                                       ATHENA                               (dryly)                          The White Cliffs of Dover.                 Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and                 pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it                 to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.                                       ATHENA                          The others will be coming soon. Send                           them, pleeze.                 Ted nods, confused by  the others,  and walks off with the                 cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.                                       TED                          Oh -- I forgot to show you how to                           turn on the Jacuzzi.                 But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water                 begins to flow from the baby cupids  urns into the hot tub.                                       ATHENA                          I been in dis  place many New Year s.                           So... you send the others to me,                           huh. Go now.                 As she says this, the door closes with a strange force,                 shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the                 suite.                 IN THE SUITE BEDROOM                 A round bed with pink tuck n roll headboard. It s impossible                 to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were                 achieved by laughing.                 Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of                 stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it                 like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the                 head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.                 Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching                 high-heeled slippers.                 And these she places with reverence on the bed.                                       ATHENA                          On this night, oh great goddess Diana,                           we restore your virgin flesh and                           bring you back to real life.                 CLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact.                                       ATHENA                          Soon -- I take you to the pond for a                           cleansing. Well, it s a swimming                           pool, but it will be under the setting                           sun, okay?                 INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS                 Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first                 guest, Elspeth arrives.                 She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue                 eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like                 Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and                 a silver sword on her shoulder.                                       TED                          May I help you?                                       ELSPETH                          I... we... have a reservation.                 Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva!                 ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a                 long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling                  PUSSY  across her breasts. This is Kiva.                 Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette                 machine. Just as Ted s eyes grow wide with anxiety, several                 packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent s hands.                                       KIVA                          Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies                           for this boring ass night.                                       ELSPETH                               (to Ted)                          We have a reservation in the Honeymoon                           Suite.                                       TED                          Oh yeah... you must be one of  the                           others.  And what re you carrying --                           the Rock of Gibraltar?                 She stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He                 walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile                 luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth                 turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva                 lights up.                                       ELSPETH                          What d I tell you about smoking?                                       KIVA                          You smoke.                                       ELSPETH                          That s right -- I smoke, and I m                           addicted to it, and I don t want the                           same thing to happen to you.                                       KIVA                               (in game-show host                                voice)                           Hello -- welcome to this week s                           edition of the Hypocrite of the Year                           Award --                  As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host,                 Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with                 an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva! That s enough --                 She cuts Kiva s ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly.                                       KIVA                          You re not my mother!                                       ELSPETH                          Yes I am.                                       KIVA                          Then why re we sleeping together?                 Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning                 to unfold here.                 Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at                 his scrutiny.                                       ELSPETH                          Well... I didn t mean it... literally.                           I... I happen to be the only one                           who... cares about you --                 But her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted,                 flustered.                                       ELSPETH                          Please -- take us to our room!                 Ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword,                 but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots                 him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous                 laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.                 AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR                 The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee                 tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room.                 Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the                 hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With                 most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers                 are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.                 But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the                 Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white                 powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands                 him a tip as he gawks at the circle.                                       ELSPETH                          Flea powder. One of the others is                           bringing her cat.                 Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look                 to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor.                 He shakes his head and leaves.                                       ELSPETH                          You re gonna have to wait in the                           other room.                                       KIVA                          Why?                                       ELSPETH                          Because I said so.                                       KIVA                          I ll watch TV.                                       ELSPETH                          You can t watch TV because the noise                           will interfere with our ritual.                 Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway.                 She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.                                       KIVA                          Okay... Mommy.                 Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom.                 Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar,                 whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing                 the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.                 Kiva, behind Elspeth s back, exits from the bedroom doorway                 into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the                 honeymoon bedroom.                 Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with                 the  cleansed  artifact and lays the slab in the center of                 the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her                 sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with                 tender affection.                                       ATHENA                          Soon -- our goddess will come. I                           will go get her negligee.                 Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks!                 Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat                 is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes                 the negligee off the irrepressible youth.                                       ATHENA                          What are you doing! Have you no                           respect -- who -- who is dis girl?                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the                           TV! I can t leave her at home --                           she s on probation and I gotta keep                           an eye on her.                                       ATHENA                          Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot                           stay here during the ritual. She may                           be one of your kind, but she is not                           one of us.                                       ELSPETH                          She stays!! Or I go -- along with my                           offering!                 The women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out --                                       ATHENA                          TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN!                                       KIVA                               (in a seductive pout)                          Make me...                 Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated                 as she firmly demands from Elspeth --                                       ATHENA                          Let s not forget -- I am the High                           Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis                           girl!                 Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and                 respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.                                       ATHENA                               (eyes lifted to heaven,                                wearily)                          Tell me -- did we have these problems                           in Salem? I don t think so...                 IN THE BEDROOM                 Elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a                 soft touch.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva... you know what I love about                           you?                 Kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.                                       ELSPETH                          Your sweet side.                                       KIVA                          And what do I get if I m sweet?                                       ELSPETH                          You get whatever you want. And you                           know what else I love about you?                                       KIVA                               (seduced now)                          What?                                       ELSPETH                          Your nose.                 And saying this, she kisses Kiva s nose and leaves the room.                 Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she                 has the last word.                                       ELSPETH                          And I saw you checking her out.                 Kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now.                 IN THE HALLWAY/EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK                 The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer                 luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous                 Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over                 her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the                 hall like a Southern princess.                                       JEZEBEL                               (talking to her cat                                in baby talk)                          Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet                           little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the                           baby.                 AT THE DOOR                 Jezebel bursts in, chattering.                                       JEZEBEL                          Well, this is just darlin ! Just                           darlin  Hi-dee, girls...                 Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place                 has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of                 exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at                 work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She                 stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub,                 which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents                 her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her                 breasts and sucks in the vibes:  Ahhhh.                  Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms,                 but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks                 it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it                 sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.                                       JEZEBEL                          Toodle-loo.                 And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors                 to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing                 on herself.                                       JEZEBEL                          Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a                           new lil  fool -- what the hell is                           she doin  here on our night of annual                           ritual?                                       ATHENA                               (wearily)                          I have sanctioned her presence, as                           long as she behaves. Come on -- there                           is more work to be done to welcome                           our great Diana.                                       KIVA                          I WANT ROOM SERVICE!!                                       ELSPETH                          Why do I always attract girls who                           are looking for a babysitter?                                       JEZEBEL                          Well now, honey, maybe Juvenile Hall                           ain t the best place to find serious                           relationship material.                 Elspeth seethes at her. Jezebel acts blithely innocent.                 IN THE HALLWAY                 Ted is walking from the room with the cart. His face is etched                 in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his                 hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well.                 Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female                 intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native                 American, Southwestern themes. No shoes.                 But she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down                 the hall, blissed-out. Ted makes eye contact, despite himself.                                       RAVEN                          I m looking for the room for making                           love.

Ted looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her                 thick dark hair. It keeps getting weirder. She wanders off.                 INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT                 The last of the lovely girls arrives. She is different from                 the others. She looks like a farm girl, very Earth Mother,                 with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple                 scarf over her long dark curls. She carries two bags by                 herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. She is                 Eva.

The other four girls are arranging the altar as Eva                 enters.                                       ATHENA                          You are very late, Eva.                                       EVA                          I m sorry, Athena. I was attending a                           birth and the placenta was late in                           coming.                 Ted is slightly queasy. She hands him a tip and smiles, then                 takes it back.                                       EVA                          Oh, wait, lemme give you a little                           more than that...                 Ted s no fool, he waits while Eva looks through her change                 purse.                                       ELSPETH                          Which birth is more important to                           you, that of a mortal or that of a                           goddess?                                       EVA                          All life is precious... but I do                           apologize for being late, Elspeth.                                       JEZEBEL                          Back home, they jist yank on the                           umbilical cord, do a Karate chop on                           the mama s belly, and them things                           come right out.                                       EVA                          They do that here, too, Jezebel, in                           the hospitals, but it causes                           hemorrhages. I fed the mother a bowl                           of comfrey tea and it brought the                           afterbirth down perfectly. The couple                           are going to use it for fertilizer                           to plant a lovely tree for their                           baby.                                       KIVA                          Oh wow -- if they were really back-                          to-nature, they d eat it, like other                           mammals do.                 CLOSE ON Ted s face as he gets thoroughly grossed out.                                       RAVEN                          In some Native American cultures,                           they dry the umbilical cord, grind                           it to a fine powder, and put it in a                           leather pouch that the baby wears to                           ward off evil. But burying the                           placenta is also a very sound                           ecological practice --  cause of the                           oxygen it carries.                                       EVA                               (cheerfully to the                                others)                          Yes -- because you see when the                           placenta detaches from the uterine                           wall...                                       TED                               (wincing in disgust)                          Uh, thank you, ladies -- I ll be                           going now. If you need anything --                 Eva places a nice tip in his palm.                                       ATHENA                          Wait. We do need a few things.                 Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot. She                 kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar,                 and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on                 the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on                 pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from                 the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone                 to materialize into the garments.                                       ATHENA                          We need fresh rosemary from the                           kitchen. Mostly what we need is from                           the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?                 Ted is watching Eva, enchanted.                                       TED                          Yeah, yeah, rosemary.                                       ATHENA                          And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher                           salt if you don t got no sea salt. A                           bottle of spring water -- Italian                           please, not French shit.                                       KIVA                          And some french fries!                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva, shut up.                                       ATHENA                               (irritated)                          And some ginger, two of the eyes of                           a trout fish, and a piece of raw                           meat, liver if you have it.                                       KIVA                               (whining)                          I want fries -- you dumb jerks with                           your stupid fucking ritual!                                       ATHENA                          Shut up, you little shit.                                       ELSPETH                          Don t talk to her that way!                 Ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. He looks at                 this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. He                 turns, points at Eva.                 Ted smiles at this angel of a girl. She smiles back. But, as                 she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing                 connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning                 with dizziness. Athena smirks.                                       ATHENA                          Get to work, man.                 Ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs                 off. After he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their                 most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or                 vials.                 Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction                 of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi,                 with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva...                                       KIVA                          What?                                       ELSPETH                          You have to go in the next room now.                                       KIVA                          Oh, wow, like I m bummed out that I                           can t watch.                               (whining at Elspeth)                          I m bored!                                       ELSPETH                          UP!                 She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her                 feet.                                       KIVA                          Don t put me in there by myself.                           I ll miss you way too much.                                       ELSPETH                          Kiva, don t do this to me.                 Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of                 the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.                                       KIVA                          Please... if you just lemme... I ll                           play dress-up with you, the way you                           like it... you know what I mean...                           remember...?                 Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up.                 Kiva pours on softer seduction.                                       KIVA                          We can pretend and I ll do it                           exactly... the way you want it...                           with the egg whites and the kilt.                 Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth s hand and                 presses it lightly on her face.                                       ELSPETH                          You mean... like last week?                 Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted  ick                  sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she s revealing this                 side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously                 looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted                 Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an                 impatient and stern Athena.                 Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.                                       ELSPETH                          We ll talk about this later, Kiva.                                       KIVA                               (angrily)                          No!                 She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her                 arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.                                       JEZEBEL                          Aw, really now -- child abuse?                                       ELSPETH                          You stay outta this!                                       ATHENA                          I demand this stop now, Elspeth!                 Elspeth lets go of Kiva s hair. Kiva jerks away from her.                                       KIVA                          I m running away from you!                                       ELSPETH                          Fine. Go ahead. And I ll call your                           parole officer and she ll find you                           and send you back to Eastlake!                 Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.                                       ATHENA                          Now that the fucking melodrama is                           over, can we start the goddamn ritual --                          pleeze?                 Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her                 shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.                                       ATHENA                          We are communing here on New Year s                           Eve to bring to life the great goddess                           Diana, who was turned to stone in                           this very room forty years ago today.                 The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to                 sway within the circle.                                       ATHENA                          Diana, great beautiful one, we make                           these offerings to you, that we may                           undo the wicked spell which deprived                           you of the seed of your lover, your                           virginal blood, of your very life.                           We now form the symbolic rock with                           our bodies.                 And saying this, the girls all form a  rock  with their bodies                 gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly                 they start to unfold from the rock.                 The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the                 Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of                 clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.                 They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the                 semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is                 Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself                 between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a                 bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.                                       ATHENA                          On this night, in this hour, we Call                           upon the Ancient Power O Goddess                           bride, I offer thee Milk from a                           mother s sweet titty!                 Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on                 the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now                 steps forward with her offering in a vial.                                       ELSPETH                          To reverse the evil which has been                           done I make this offering to the                           Divine One A whore not, an innocent                           was, For whom I seized a virgin s                           blood.                                       JEZEBEL                          Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust,                           To undo this awful spell is a real                           must. To bring you life and get you                           high I offer the sweat of five men s                           thighs.                 The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her                 offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle.                 Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She                 unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.                                       RAVEN                          Diana, oh great one, we live without                           sun Until this wicked curse is undone.                           In hope that you live, and to us                           appear, I have collected a year s                           worth of tears.                 She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it s                 Eva s turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the                 altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting                 for Eva s offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she                 goes.                 Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle                 with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to                 incant.                                       EVA                          Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will,                           I was to bring fresh sperm from my                           Bill. I had him erect, and his semen                           would follow But alas I was hot, so                           hot that I swallowed.                 The moans turn to wails as the girls GASP and SHRIEK! Athena                 opens her eyes, wildly.                                       ATHENA                          You stupid little witch! You swallowed                           the sperm! Aye-yi--yi!                 Elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.                                       ELSPETH                          It just shows what an amazing lack                           of control you have over yourself,                           Eva!                                       JEZEBEL                          Honey, why didn t you just use your                           hands? Didn t your mama teach you                           not to put them things in your mouth?                                       RAVEN                          I understand though...                 Eva bursts into tears. Athena is firm.                                       ATHENA                          There is no time to cry over swallowed                           sperms. You re gonna have to get                           some, baby. You have one hour to                           prove what kind of witch you really                           are.                 Just then: a knock at the door.                                       ATHENA                               (calling out)                          What do you want?!                                       TED                          Ted... the bellboy.                 Athena smiles and turns to Eva.                                       ATHENA                          Mr. Bellboy, come right in!                 Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the                 fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all                 except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.                 Amazingly, Ted s attention is captivated by Eva s sorrow,                 not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers                 her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks                 away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart.                 Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels                 in the cart.                                       TED                          Here s the things you asked for. Oh,                           and uhh, sorry, but I m not gonna                           pick the eyes outta this dead fish.                 He points to the trout. Elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes                 into the Jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window.                 She smirks at him comtemptuously.                                       ATHENA                               (handing Ted 50 bucks)                          Okay, mister, here s your fifty-dollar                           tip, only, you have to do one more                           thing... make our little Eva smile.                           Can you? We ll leave you alone.                               (to Eva, firmly)                          And don t use your mouth!                 The girls step out. Athena turns to Eva and points to her                 watch, then holds up one finger. Eva looks up, worried. The                 door closes on her and Ted. She looks at Ted and sighs. He                 covers her with a shawl.                 IN THE HALLWAY                 The other witches listen at the door.                                       ELSPETH                          If she doesn t get his goop in ten                           minutes, I m going to take him myself.                                       JEZEBEL                          Ha! That ll be a first for you.                                       ELSPETH                          Oh shit -- Kiva!                 She runs back in for her bratty girlfriend, who is already                 sneaking out the bedroom door.                                       ELSPETH                          And just where do you think you re                           going?                                       KIVA                          Well, gawd -- I need a candy bar or                           something -- you haven t fed me all                           day. I m getting all shaky. My blood                           sugar s really low.                                       JEZEBEL                          Elspeth -- honestly now -- some                           babysitter you re turnin  out ta be!                                       ATHENA                          Enough, girls. I will collect fresh                           earth. Jezebel, I want you to gather                           damp moss. Raven, you bring me a                           birch branch.                 Elspeth, you go feed your terrible girlfriend. We meet back                 here in one hour and let s all have faith that Eva can get                 this guy off.                 The witches disperse.                 INT. HONEYMOON SUITE--NIGHT                 Eva sits among pillows before the altar as Ted stands in                 front of her. Ted is trying his best to make poor Eva smile.                 But no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.                                       TED                          Help me out, lady. I gotta earn this                           fifty bucks!                                       EVA                          Oh look, they don t care if I smile                           or not! All they want is...                 Ted waits; she sighs and rest her chin in her hand.                                       EVA                          You won t understand, believe me.                 She begins to cry tearfully again.                                       TED                          Try me. I ve been around, y know.                 He postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him                 helplessly. And he paternally encourages her to explain.                                       EVA                          Well... okay. The five of us --                           Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and                           me -- are a coven.                                       TED                          Ha, like a coven of witches?                                       EVA                          Yes.                                       TED                               (stunned)                          Oh.                 He looks around the room: QUICK CUTS of candles, iconography,                 jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven                 into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that                 can? Ted s getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up.                                       TED                          I knew that!                                       EVA                               (getting calmer)                          And you see, our coven has spent                           forty years trying to perfect a ritual                           to undo a wicked curse put on our                           goddess Diana.                                       TED                          Gee, you don t look a day over twenty!                                       EVA                          Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches                           before us tried and failed. But                           Athena, our High Priestess, discovered                           a great potion to reverse the evil                           spell which turned our beautiful                           goddess into an old rock.                                       TED                               (looking at the rock)                          Yeah? Is... is that her?                 Eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone.                                       EVA                          She was a beautiful virgin. An                           entertainer by trade, but a great                           sorceress by design. It was here in                           this very room, on her wedding night,                           a jealous rival placed the curse on                           Diana.                                       TED                          She turned to -- that -- here?                                       EVA                          Yes... and her young husband turned                           into a pink fish! They found him                           swimming in the pool in circles.                           While our dear goddess: a stone in                           her honeymoon bed.                 Ted frowns as he ponders all this. Eva takes a photo from                 the altar and hands it to Ted.                                       EVA                          This was Diana.                 CLOSE ON photo: a Blond Bombshell in full-on Betty Page                 attire, a bare-tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl                 in bondage with a spiked high heel.                                       TED                          This girl here? This is the goddess                           Diana?                 The photograph slowly comes alive. Diana stops spanking the                 girl and unties her.                 She pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap                 and makes the girl stand. The women face each other and break                 into a cheek-to-cheek tango.                 CLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head. Are his eyes playing                 tricks on him?                                       TED                          I hate to tell you this, but I kinda                           doubt she was a virgin.                                       EVA                          Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but                           she saved that for marriage. Which                           is the example I ve tried to follow:                           to do everything but that till I                           marry...

If you say she                           was a virgin, I ll believe it.

Kiva, now having raised her                 blood sugar, sucks on a lollipop, a sunny girl. She talks to                 Raven, who carries a birch limb.

KIVA                          Hey -- I wanna be a witch!                 The other girls roll their eyes as Elspeth smiles proudly.                 Ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the                 hall. The witches run inside the room.

Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts                 again. Kiva throws off her shirt to join in. As she does, we                 see black bondage tape on her nipples. Elspeth darts a quick                 look at the tape, looks at the other witches -- not sure she                 likes this -- but she goes with it. The witches sway in a                 circle, eyes closed, as Eva makes her offering.

Four discouraged witches                 pack their bags. The room has been restored to its worldly                 under-splendor. Kiva uses the remote on the TV... so much                 for witchcraft. The slab of rock remains a slab.

DARK HALLWAY                 Ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner                 of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side. He                 pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something                 like  Room 404.                  Ted knocks on the door. After a moment, the latch is thrown                 and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark                 room.                 INT.

In a flash the lights switch on and Ted finds himself staring                 down the barrel of a pretty intense-looking .357 Magnum,                 cocked and ready to fire. At the other end of the gun stands                 a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile                 and a  just try fuckin  with me  look on his face. Sigfried                 isn t the only person in the room. Directly behind him sits                 a beautiful young woman, Angela, gagged and bound to a chair.                 Ted drops the bucket to the floor.                                       TED                          I brought your ice.

Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of                 assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like                 they were breath mints. Sigfried thrusts his hand forward,                 gripping Ted by the throat, and leads him to Angela.

Suddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his                 pistol smack into Ted s temple, sending him to the floor.                 Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock.

Sigfried s mood swings                 drastically; he bends down next to Ted.

It s pretty cozy. To say nothing                           of how stupid an idea it is to lie                           to a man with a loaded gun without                           considering the possible response.

Oh yeah, I remember.                 Sigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position.                                       SIGFRIED                          I want you to pray for forgiveness,                           Theodore.                 Sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the                 same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move,                 but thinks better of it. Sigfried s eyes pop open. He cuts a                 look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Now say after me,  I apologize...                                        TED                          I apologize...                                       SIGFRIED                          For what?                 Ted looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with                 intense, wide-open eyes.                                       SIGFRIED                          For fucking what?                                       TED                          That I said you might have been                           unfaithful?                                       SIGFRIED                           That I said you might have been                           unfaithful?  Listen, Theodore, you re                           in church here... you re kneeling in                           front of an altar. Truth... truth is                           all it hears. Say the following,  I,                           Theodore, must humbly and sincerely                           apologize for saying that you fucked                           another man!                  Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have                 a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor,                 turning his face to Angela.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Satisfied?                 Angela nods.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Do you accept the fucking apology?                 Naturally, Angela says nothing.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          You always gotta get the last word,                           don t you? It s one way with you,                           Angela, isn t it? I give and I give                           and I get nothing back.                 Sigfried turns to Ted.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          She just sits there waiting for me                           to jump through hoops...                 Angela attempts to speak through the gag. Both men wait with                 bated breath for a response. Sigfried s had enough.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          Stupid me, for a second I thought                           you were going to say something...                           something like,  I m sorry.  HA!                            I m sorry.  You re absolutely right,                           love cakes, I wouldn t want it that                           way. That s one thing you can say                           about Angela. She ll never do anything                           she doesn t want to do. If the feeling                           ain t there, she just isn t going to                           do it. There is nothing in this world                           as fucked as a woman who gives when                           she doesn t want to. Never let that                           happen to you, Theodore. It makes                           you feel very little indeed.                 Ted beckons Sigfried.                                       TED                          You mind if I...?                                       SIGFRIED                          Go ahead. Spit it out.                                       TED                          I don t mean to upset you further,                           sir, but I think she was trying to                           say yes.                                       SIGFRIED                          Are you condescending to me, Theodore?                                       TED                          Absolutely not, I would never do                           that.                                       SIGFRIED                          Why don t you just say it?                                       TED                          Say what?                                       SIGFRIED                          That you think I m an idiot.                                       TED                          I would never say that.                                       SIGFRIED                          You think you re superior to me,                           don t ya, Theodore? You don t think                           I notice there is a gag in the woman s                           mouth.                                       TED                          Of course you do.                                       SIGFRIED                          Naturally  of course.  And do you                           know how I know that?                                       TED                          How, sir?                                       SIGFRIED                          Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH!                           I m gonna let you in on a little                           secret about communication, Theodore.                           It s all in the eyes...                               (points the gun at                                Ted)                          Him?                               (turns the gun on                                himself)                          Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let s                           drag it out.                 Sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving                 the empty bottle over his shoulder. He takes off, disappearing                 into the bathroom.                 INT. ROOM                 Ted finds himself alone with Angela. They lock eyes. Angela                 implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation:                 His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the                 fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted                 paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to                 get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what                 appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point                 and cautiously removes the gag from Angela s mouth. Angela                 spits an old sock out.                                       TED                          What!

Ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie Angela or                 not.                                       TED                          I don t know if I can do this.

On nervous impulse, Ted begins the calculations.                                       ANGELA                          I don t mean literally, you ignoramus.

You look so much                           more attractive when you re self-                          assured.                 Sigfried suddenly comes to life... He s heard from the                 bathroom belting out  Life is but a dream... she-boom, she-                boom.

TED                          That s fine.                                       SIGFRIED                          I used to have a little bunny rabbit                           named Teddy, it looked real cute                           nibbling on Angela s ear. Only problem                           here is you re no bunny rabbit,                           Theodore, and it really fuckin  razzes                           me to picture you doin  it. But don t                           let me stop you, Teddy... no need to                           play sneaky-poo.                 Ted starts to back toward the door.                                       TED                          Look, man, if this is some kind of                           Voodoo thing and you want me to have                           sex with your wife, there is                           absolutely no way.                                       SIGFRIED                               (shouts at the top of                                his lungs)                          I said, nibble, asshole! Now!                 The directness of Sigfried s command, coupled with the SOUND                 of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela.                 Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy                 makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he                 closes in, Angela s eyes close.                                       TED                               (whispers)                          Sorry, lady.                 Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela.                                       SIGFRIED                          What s the matter, no whiz left in                           the cheese? I m not cramping your                           style, am I?                                       TED                          Look, I m not playing this game                           anymore.                 Sigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him.                                       SIGFRIED                          It s almost all over, Theodore, and                           soon you can go home to Mommy.                 Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried s powerful bear                 hug and blasts out the following monologue.                                       TED                          My name is not Theodore, it s TED,                           TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT                           TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes,                           my mother did me the service of naming                           me Theodore and I haven t a clue as                           to how you know that because everyone                           who knows that lives a long way away                           from here. Do you have any idea what                           it s like to go to school where all                           the other kids  parents are in jail                           doing time for crimes like grand                           larceny, aggravated assault, burglary                           and murder, and you get stuck with a                           mother who names you Theodore and                           dressed you up in little matching                           pink outfits with, get this, a little                           blue bow fucking tie! Well, I ll                           tell you what happens. Pretty soon                           Theodore becomes  Theo the Thumper,                            and when Theo the Thumper gets old                           enough, he packs his bags and goes                           thousands of miles away where he can                           put the whole bloody mess behind                           him. So, if you don t mind, shoot me                           now, because no one is going to call                           me that again. My name is Ted, okay?                           Got it? TED!                 Sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence.                 He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand.                                       SIGFRIED                          Sigfried.                                       TED                          What?                                       SIGFRIED                          My name is Sigfried.                                       TED                          Sigfried?                 Sigfried cuts a  Something wrong with that?  look at Ted.                                       SIGFRIED                          Yah, Sigfried.                                       TED                          Nice to meet you, Sigfried.                 Ted cautiously takes Sigfried s hand.                                       SIGFRIED                          Very impressive, Ted.  Theo the                           Thumper? ... Ouch. It s a deal, kid.                           Ted it will be.                                       TED                          Thanks.                 Sigfried holds onto Ted s hand. The soft sound of distant                 fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled                 countdown signal that it s New Year s.                 Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of                 nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted s                 mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really                 getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure.                 He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he                 flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all                 over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve                 while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.                                       TED                          You okay, mister? I ll get help!                 Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at                 Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          That s the wrong door, sir.                 Sigfried grabs Ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the                 gun into his crotch.                 Sigfried pulls Ted s face closer to his.                                       SIGFRIED                          Get me the nitro... it s in the                           bathroom cabinet. Now!                 Ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving Sigfried a babbling                 mess behind.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME                 Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an                 earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place.                 An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills                 are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to                 hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked                  Nitro.  No luck.                 Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.                 He figures this is the best chance he s got to make a break.                 Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm                 through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in                 the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-                bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the                 apartment.                                       SIGFRIED (O.S.)                               (shouting in the                                distance)                          It s no time to take a leak, Teddy,                           I m fucking dying here!                 EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT                 Outside the window, Ted s in another world. He s almost safe.                 It s a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water                 in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass                 off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the                 witches  room from the floor below.                 EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT                 Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her                 name out, to no avail.                 The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for                 help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang                 there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have                 found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably                 everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody                 hand print. It s not his blood.                 EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT                 Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around,                 spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag                 on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him.                 After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.                                       TED                          Hi...                 No answer. Something s wrong with the guy, all the blood is                 drained from his face and he is mumbling something.                                       TED                          Listen, I m stuck here in a situation                           that I can t even begin to explain,                           but would you be so kind as to get                           help? Could you call the police,                           please?                 Silence.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          You okay?                 The young man manages to belt out the word  ice  just before                 hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted s                 strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the                 bathroom. He falls back on the floor.                 He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices                 something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks                 into the bedroom.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER                 Ted looks around the still room. No one s there.                                       TED                          Sigfried?                 He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his                 eye, he spots Sigfried s hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out                 on the floor. Angela s chair has been knocked on its side.                 Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag                 from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.                                       ANGELA                          Where s the fucking nitro?                                       TED                          I couldn t find it!                                       ANGELA                          You took long enough. Untie me, for                           Christ s sake, you fucking upset him                           and he s dying.                 Ted struggles to untie Angela.                                       TED                          I thought you wanted to kill him.                                       ANGELA                          You d make a great cop, Theodore.                 The knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie.                                       TED                          I can t handle this alone, I d better                           get help.                 Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who s been                 taking in the whole conversation.                                       SIGFRIED                          I tie a pretty good knot, don t I,                           Ted?                                       TED                          Thank God you re okay...                                       SIGFRIED                          Never felt better.                 Angela hears Sigfried s voice from behind her back.                                       ANGELA                          You bastard!                                       SIGFRIED                               (to Angela)                          Come on, honey, don t get mad. It                           was just a little test, and I m glad                           I did it because now I ll know forever                           that you really do love me. Truly                           and deeply.                                       ANGELA                          If the simple fact that I didn t                           want your bloated, dead body lying                           out on the floor is love, then no                           wonder we find ourselves as we are                           at this very fucking moment.                                       SIGFRIED                          Oh, no. I heard you and there was                           genuine care in that voice. Can t be                           denied. Can it, Ted?                                       TED                          I think you re right and, if you                           just keep this kind of open dialogue                           going, you ll go a long way to                           resolving this misunderstanding.                 Ted edges his way toward the door.                                       TED                               (continuing)                          You d be surprised what happens when                           people just listen to each other                           without succumbing to all that pain                           and anger.                                       ANGELA                          You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for                           you to say after you fuck another                           man s wife. You should at least have                           the guts to stand by your convictions.                 Sigfried turns an icy eye on Ted, who has given up all hope                 of ever getting out of the room.                                       TED                          That s a lie, Sigfried. I swear to                           God.                 Angela continues her tirade.                                       ANGELA                          When I think of all the times you                           were inside me promising me a better                           life, it makes me want to puke.                 Sigfried slowly raises his gun, pointing it directly at Ted s                 chest.                                       TED                          Why are you doing this? What have I                           ever done to you people?                                       ANGELA                          What didn t you do, stick man?                           Unfortunately, you don t have the                           balls to back up the actions of your                           huge cock.                 The words hit Sigfried like bullets to the chest... his legs                 weaken.                                       SIGFRIED                               (whimpering)                          He s got a huge cock?                                       TED                          She s lying again, mister. It s not                           that big.                                       SIGFRIED                          Show it to me.                                       TED                          Come on, man, she s lying. Can t you                           see she s fucking with you?                                       ANGELA                          Put it this way, God made up for                           what he did to Gumby with Ted here.                                       SIGFRIED                          Show it to me.                                       ANGELA                          Show him your cock, Theodore.                 Sigfried runs over to Angela and kneels in front of her.                                       SIGFRIED                          Stop talking about his cock, will                           you?!                                       ANGELA                          It s hard to stop talking about                           something so huge. I could go on and                           on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop,                           wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile,                           Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber,                           salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong,                           dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy,                           prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee,                           wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol,                           joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third-                          leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.                 Angela is on a roll. She fires the words at Sigfried, hitting                 him pointblank. He staggers. He pleads with her to stop,                 covering his ears. Ted watches the man crumble.                                       ANGELA                               (continuing)                          Junior, the little head, little guy,                           Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake,                           one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder,                           shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin                           flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter,                           instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod,                           cherrypicker, log, pole.                 Sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop                 the flow; she manages to give him a  fuck of a bite  in the                 process. Meanwhile, Ted figures this to be his moment to                 make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by                 Sigfried at the one-yard line. After a struggle, the two men                 rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.                                       SIGFRIED                          Please, don t leave me. I ll call                           you Ted from now on.                                       TED                          It s not me, mister, I swear.                                       SIGFRIED                          Personally, I don t give a fuck,                           Ted, it s just I don t want to be                           alone right now. I m feeling a little                           vulnerable.                 Sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half-empty                 bottle of Jack Daniel s, and passes it to Ted, who takes a                 hit.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted.                           You know my father used to say that                           forgiveness is the only thing that                           evil can t sink its teeth into.                                       TED                          That s beautiful.                                       SIGFRIED                          Kind of nice down here on the floor,                           isn t it, Ted?                                       TED                          Yes, actually.                                       SIGFRIED                          Things take on a whole new                           perspective... You d like my trust,                           wouldn t you, Ted?                                       TED                          Yes I would.                                       SIGFRIED                          I just got one thing to ask you and                           I ll let you go.                                       TED                          Okay. Okay.                                       SIGFRIED                          Tell me straight now.                                       TED                          What?                                       SIGFRIED                          What was it like?                                       TED                          What was what like?                                       SIGFRIED                          You know, you and her.                                       TED                          Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do                           you want me to say?                                       SIGFRIED                          Either way you re fucked, right? You                           ever gonna see her again, Theodore?                                       TED                          If I ever saw her again, I d run the                           other way.                                       SIGFRIED                          Promise?                                       TED                          I promise.                 Sigfried releases Ted and stands up.                                       SIGFRIED                          You re lying, but I can respect that,                           Ted. If you told me, it would no                           longer be a secret, and secrets have                           a power, kid. You open that box and                           they disappear forever. A bad secret                           will rip you apart, but the good one                           are all you got. In the end, when                           all the people you knew are dead and                           gone, all you ll have left are you                           secrets. And when you die, the box                           is open and it all blows away --                           dust to dust -- all the anger,                           jealousy, desire and love just blow                           away.                 Sigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          So you know what I say, let s call                           it a truce, kiddo.                 Sigfried takes Ted by the hand and leads him to an open                 window. Ted is overcome by the sweetness in Sigfried s voice                 and follows him to the window willingly.                 The two men look out into the dark Los Angeles night.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          I m a man of love, Theodore. Love is                           all I live for.                                       TED                          I can see that.                                       SIGFRIED                          Maybe to a fault.                                       TED                          Don t beat yourself up over it.                                       SIGFRIED                          That s nice of you to say, Ted, but                           I probably should make a clean break                           of it, cut her loose and get my own                           place. I just can t imagine living                           without her. Do you think I should                           seek professional help?                                       TED                          It s not for everyone, but maybe in                           your case it could help.                                       SIGFRIED                          You ever been out on the ocean at                           night?                 Ted shakes his head.                                       SIGFRIED                               (continuing)                          I have... scary as a motherfucker,                           all that darkness around you. It s                           like a big black carpet rolled out                           as far as the eye can see. Sometimes,                           if you re lucky, you ll see a light.                           It could be as small as a little                           spark, but it will cut a path straight                           through all that blackness, straight                           to you. It could be another boat, or                           some distant fire on an island, but                           that light will shed a shining path                           of diamonds cutting through mile                           after mile of darkness to lie at                           your feet. That s love, Ted, it s                           like a path of light in an ocean of                           darkness.                 Ted and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed                 by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out,                 shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela                 stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side.                 Sigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood.                 Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up                 at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands                 the bullets to Ted.                                       ANGELA                               (to Ted)                          You d better go check to see if I                           killed anybody downstairs.                 Sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.                                       TED                          You people gonna be okay?

ANGELA                          Another time, Ted.                 Ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at                 the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before                 closing the door behind him.                                                                      CUT TO:                 INT. HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER                 Ted walks down the hallway, lost in thought. An energetic                 Young Guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him.                                       YOUNG GUY                          Happy New Year, buddy.                                       TED                          Happy New Year.                                       YOUNG GUY                          I was just in room 404, what a party!                           You know where room 409 is at?                                       TED                          Beats me. It s somewhere around here.                 The guy takes off in the direction Ted s walking from. Ted                 suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting                 to the Young Guy.

He breathes slowly. He                 finally has one moment s peace after an already long night.                 He even has a chance to straighten his tie.                 The phone RINGS.                                       TED                          Front desk.                                                                      CUT TO:                 ROOM 716                 CLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man s mouth as he                 speaks into the telephone.                                       MAN                          Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.                 Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an                 already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to                 face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his                 mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.                 He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his                 tie.                 He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife                 and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a                 beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine,                 and Juancho, six.                 Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.                 He watches his Wife comb Juancho s hair down and to the side                 like an idiot.                 Not being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away                 from his Wife and snatches the comb.                                       MAN                          Give me that...                 Man begins to slick Juancho s hair back.                                       MAN                          There... see? You look cool with                           your hair up like this. Like me...                 Juancho is smiling now. He s happy he s going to look like                 his dad.                                       MAN                          Not down and to the side, all stupid                           like your mom likes to comb it.                 Juancho looks over at Sarah, who is going through the tortuous                 ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her                 long, unmanageable hair.                 Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled                 mess.                 Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho s                 hair. Juancho s hair is thinner than Man s, so it won t stay                 up.                 Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle                 on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.                 Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he s smoking                 too, just like his dad.                 Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down                 to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down                 at Juancho s, which won t stay up.                 Man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration.                                        MAN                          You ve got your mother s hair.                 In anger, Man starts messing up Juancho s hair.                                       MAN                          I can t do anything with it.                 Furious, Man simply swipes Juancho s hair back down and to                 the side, the way Wife had it before. Juancho looks like an                 idiot again.                                       MAN                          There. Go.                 Juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom.                 Sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.                                       WIFE                               (putting a plastic                                clip in Sarah s hair)                          There. Go.                 Sarah exits.                 Wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. Man lights up a                 new cigarette.                                       WIFE                               (mocking)                          So, are we gonna have fun tonight?                 Man blows smoke in Wife s face as he walks out of the                 bathroom.                                       WIFE                          I didn t think so.                 Sarah has joined Juancho in watching television.                 Man watches the children watch TV. We can see the wheels                 turning in Man s head.                 He turns back to the bathroom.                 He watches Wife now. Wheels turning. Practically burning                 rubber.                                       MAN                          Hey.                 Wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband. She is                 beautiful.                                       MAN                               (shrugs)                          Let s just leave the kids here.                 Wife glances out at the children, eyes glued to the tube.                                       WIFE                          Here in the room? By themselves?                                       MAN                          No... with the television.                 Wife thinks about it for a second. She shrugs a  sure.                                        MAN                          You want to have fun tonight, don t                           you?                                       WIFE                          Yes.                                       MAN                          They ll be fine.                 He kisses Wife s face and exits the bathroom. She covers the                 wet spot with more cake makeup.                                       MAN                          Hey.                 The children turn to face him.                                       MAN                          You guys are going to stay here and                           watch TV.                 The children look at each other.                                       MAN                          I want you to be in bed asleep before                           twelve. Your mother and I will be                           back later on.                 Wife goes straight for the door.                                       MAN                          Okay?                 He blows one kiss. One for both of them.                 As Man and his Wife walk out the door, Man turns back to the                 children...                                       MAN                          Don t misbehave.                 He closes the door.                 Sarah stands in the middle of the room. She s looking at the                 door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned.                 Her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She                 touches the edges of the fabric.                                       SARAH                          Why did we have to get all dressed                           up if we weren t going with them?

They wait.                                                                      CUT TO:                 ROOM 716                 Juancho shuts off the television. He drops the remote to the                 floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside. He leaps                 to the window and begins unlatching it.

Man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in                 the doorway, glaring at the mischievous Juancho.                 Juancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back                 inside. He leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the TV                 with the remote.

WIFE                          But I want some now...                 Ted is torn. Man pushes him into the room.

After setting up the                 bottle, he turns to leave, but now Man closes the door,                 trapping Ted inside with them.

She has an unusually adult                 temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and                 sees that the nudies are still in full force.                                       SARAH                          Change the channel, now!                 Juancho turns around. He has a face like someone just laid a                 fart in his nose.                                       JUANCHO                          Man, you re the one with the stinky                           feet.                 Sarah smells her feet. Twice.                                       SARAH                          They don t stink.                                       JUANCHO                          Yeah, they do.                                       SARAH                          Here, smell for yourself.                 She sticks her foot out for Juancho to smell. He s reluctant.                 Fearful.                                       SARAH                          Go ahead.                 He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his                 head to her foot. Very slowly.                 Sarah waits until he s close enough to her foot before she                 kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed                 and crashing to the floor.                 She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the                 channel to a cartoon.                 Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander                 about. Looking for something to do...                 Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It s only a                 matter of time before he finds mischief.                 Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for                 the bottle.                                       JUANCHO                               (holding up the bottle)                          Hey, get a bottle opener!                 Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the                 champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she                 wants some champagne too.                 She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho                 unwraps the bottle top.                 Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few                 hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer                 slide forward.                 Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks                 down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and                 casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone                 rings.                 FRONT DESK                 Ted, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room                 404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at                 the board and see room 716 s light blinking.                 He sighs in exasperation.                 INT. ROOM                 Sarah sees Juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently.                                       SARAH                          Don t shake it!                               (into phone)                          Ted? Hi. It s me. Sarah.                                       TED                          Yeah. Who died? No one? Then don t                           call me.                                       SARAH                          I thought I d tell you that your                           cleaning ladies are doing a bum job.                           There s all kinds of leftover stuff                           around here.                 Sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand                 several times.                                       SARAH                          Needles and things. We re not supposed                           to have needles here, are we? I mean,                           they don t come with the room, do                           they? Send someone up here to clean                           this place up right.                 The champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho. He looks                 surprised.                                       SARAH                               (to Juancho)                          I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT!                               (to Ted)                          I gotta go. My brother just exploded                           the champagne all over the room. Oh,                           and bring us a couple of toothbrushes.                           There s a card in the bathroom that                           says you ll bring free toothbrushes                           if we ask for them.                 She hangs up.                 A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the                 elevator.                 Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They                 turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the                 taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.                 Sarah clearly doesn t like it, but tries to pretend she does.                 Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how                 to make room-to-room calls.                                       SARAH                          I m calling another room, give me                           three numbers.                                       JUANCHO                          4-0-9.                 Sarah punches in the room number. The phone rings.                 She holds the needle up to the light to examine it.                                       SARAH                          Hello? Hi. You don t know me, and I                           don t know you, but... do you have                           any needles? We ve got needles here                           and I was wondering if they come                           with the room or not. Don t have                           any? Thanks. Just checking.                 She hangs up.                 Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his                 father s coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes                 one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.                 Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an                 idea.                 MONTAGE:                 In the bathroom, Sarah seeks out her mother s lipstick.                 ROOM 716                 Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick                 to draw a bull s-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She                 writes numbers next to each circle representing points.                 Juancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging                 out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique.                                       SARAH                               (pointing out the                                rules)                          The center is the bull s eye, 100                           points, this one s 10 points, this                           one s 20 points.                 WHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point                 slot.                                       SARAH                          Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out                           of the way!                 Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to                 the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the                 needle into the curtain to hide it.                 Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter                 with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.                 He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots                 the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping                 into the carpet.                                       TED                          I brought you some milk and cookies.                           If you want some you have to eat                           them now, because you re going to                           sleep.                                       SARAH                          We re going to sleep now?                                       TED                          Your parents said put you to bed                           before midnight. Well, it s before                           midnight. Maybe that way you ll leave                           me alone.                                       SARAH                          Those aren t milk and cookies.                                       TED                          We were out of cookies, so I brought                           you milk and Saltines. Don t complain!                           Now hurry up and eat. You re going                           to bed right now.                 Juancho bites into a Saltine. Sarah simply examines one.                                       JUANCHO                          These are old.                                       SARAH                          They re stale.                                       TED                               (impatient)                          Dip  em in the milk! The milk will                           make them soft.                 Sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray.                 She s a little drunk.                 Ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle.                 Juancho dips his crackers and eats them. He makes a face and                 drops a soggy cracker onto the tray.                                       TED                          No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time.                           Now, I don t want you guys wandering                           around, so if you need to go to the                           restroom, go now.                 They go to the bathroom. Ted sits on the bed. Waits.                 He sees the painting on the wall but can t figure out what s                 different about it.                 The red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of                 the painting.                 Ted smells something funny. He looks down and sees the socks                 on the bed. He grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to                 throw the socks across the room.                 The kids come back out.                                       JUANCHO                          What about our pajamas?                                       TED                          You wanna look nice in case there s                           an earthquake, don tcha?                 The children nod.                                       TED                          Okay. Then stay in those clothes.                 The kids lie on the bed.                 Sarah notices a jar of Mentholatum ointment on the dinner                 tray.                                       SARAH                          What s that?                                       TED                          Oh, this is just some Mentholatum                           ointment. Come on, under the covers.                           Close your eyes and I ll tell you a                           story.                 The children close their eyes. Ted opens the jar of the                 ointment and sniffs it.                 Strong stuff by the look on his face.                                       TED                          Your dad says he doesn t trust                           babysitters. I don t blame him. You                           know what my babysitter did to me                           once?                               (confiding)                          I never told my parents, either.                 The children lie in the bed, eyes closed, listening intently.                 Ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment.                                       TED                          I hated going to sleep. You know,                           it s nighttime and you wanna run                           around and act crazy. So what my                           babysitter did to make sure I d go                           to sleep and not be tempted to get                           up, was, she d take some of this                           vapor rub stuff... Can you smell                           this?                 Eyes closed, the kids inhale. They smell the ointment and                 nod yes.                                       TED                          Well, she d just dab a little of                           this over each eyelid, so that I                           would be sure and keep my eyes closed                           all night.                 Ted is spreading the ointment over their eyelids as he says                 this.                                       TED                          There. Now you ve got some, too!                           Don t open your eyes or it ll burrrn,                           burn, burn. The smell helps clear                           your sinuses too, so it s doing double                           duty.

TED                          If you keep your eyes closed all                           night, it will wear off by morning.                           But DON T OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE                           THAT...                                       SARAH                          Did you ever open your eyes?                 Extreme CLOSE-UP on Ted s eyes.                                       TED                          Yes... I did.                 The children are quiet.                                       TED                          And now look at me.

Sleep                           well and I won t tell your parents                           about the champagne.                 Ted leaves.                                                                      CUT TO:                 AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS                 After a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the                 loud crashing of fireworks outside the window.                 Sarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming                 from the window and she tilts her head toward it.                 The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her                 face.                 She inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for                 the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets                 to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the                 sink.                 She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully.                 She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them                 in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine.                 She goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and                 grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently.                 Juancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still                 closed.                                       JUANCHO                          Are you watching TV?                 The champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass.                                       SARAH                          Yep. If you wanna watch too, you                           have to go wash your face.                 Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He                 slams into the wall, hard.                                       SARAH                          Be careful...                 Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more                 cautious.                 Sarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and                 shudders.                 She smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells                 it.                 She smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne.                 Nothing.                 Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his                 foot and smells it.                 She drops his foot.                 Juancho stares blankly at her.                 Sarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress.                 Juancho looks at her as if she s drunk.                 Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She                 takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks                 toward the mattress.                 Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back.                 Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see                 what is underneath it.                 Juancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed                 into the bedsprings is a woman s dead and beaten corpse.                                                                      CUT TO:                 CLOSE ON                 Ted s phone ringing.                 Ted looks at the phone as if pondering whether or not to                 answer it. He taps his fingers. Finally he answers the phone.                 ROOM 716                                       SARAH                          Ted!

Thinking.                 Juancho lights up a cigarette for real and takes nervous                 puffs.                 Sarah carries the phone over to Juancho and snatches the                 cigarette away from him. She stuffs it in her own mouth and                 nervously takes a long drag on it.                                       SARAH                               (through cigarette)                          You never tried it, did you?

She drinks from her champagne bottle. She s pulling the                 mattress back over the corpse again.

You!                 FRONT DESK                 Ted slams down the phone.                 As he walks away from the counter, he spots the children s                 parents driving up to the valet out front.                                       TED                          Oh shit!                 Ted breaks into a sprint and dives into a closing elevator.

Not                 happy.                 ROOM 716                 Ted bursts into the room. He sees the disarray.                 Ted pushes the champagne out of Sarah s hand, spilling it                 onto the floor.                                       TED                          What the fuck is going on??!!                 He sees Juancho with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth                 and rips it away from him. The butt goes flying onto the                 carpet near the spreading champagne spill.

Sarah grabs the hypodermic needle from under the curtain and                 stabs it into Ted s leg.                                       TED                          FUCK!!                 Sarah steps back, almost tripping over the champagne bottle.                 She picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case Ted                 tries to retaliate. Ted spins around, now noticing the needle                 sticking out of his leg.                                       TED                          Jesus!!                 Juancho lights up another cigarette.                 The champagne spill has spread to the fallen cigarette butt.                 The carpet bursts into flames around the spill.                                                              CUT OUTSIDE TO:                 EXT.

BACK TO:                 ROOM 716                 Ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it                 makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle                 still stuck in his leg.                 Ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman s foot for                 support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV                 on to the Nudie channel, just as...                 Man opens the door.                 Man stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm,                 the door knob in the other hand. He s looking mean.                 Man s POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We                 pan up the dead woman s leg to find Ted holding her foot. We                 pan down Ted s leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting                 out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken                 syringe plunger.                 We pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire                 blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne                 bottle in Sarah s hand, then over to the cigarette hanging                 out of Juancho s mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of                 his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts                 immediately.                 Man drops his Wife to the floor.                 In the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the                 fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window                 behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through                 the room.                 Man simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks...                                       MAN                          Did they misbehave?

The doors open and a                 wet, disheveled, and frantic Ted steps out.                 He staggers across the lobby to the reception desk. He grabs                 the phone.                 INT. BETTY S APT--ALMOST DAWN                 The wild New Year s Eve party is winding down.

MARGARET                          An oven full of witches fucked you?                           Is that like at the circus when they                           stick all those clowns in an itty-                          bitty car?                                       TED                          A coven. A coven of witches. Well,                           one witch in particular.                                       MARGARET                          Was she an old hag with a mole, with                           hair growing out of it?                                       TED                          No-no-no, she was... quite beautiful.                 Margaret thinks for a moment.

But it was                           still an unnerving way to start off                           the night.                                       MARGARET                          Sounds to me like a pretty great way                           to start off the night.                                       TED                          Okay, let s just skip over the                           witches.

MARGARET                          Well, for one thing it s the                           difference between a .44 Magnum and                           a Magnum .357.

Buenas noches.                 A RINGING SOUND happens that we haven t heard before. Ted s                 head turns toward it.                 It s the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is                 ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed.                 Betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The                 sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks                 style again.                                       BETTY                               (suddenly alert)                          Is that the penthouse?

TED                          Yes, I did.                                       BETTY                          No problem, this is a hotel, we ve                           had dead bodies before, it s just                           the price of doing business. You                           said the hotel was on fire. Is it                           still on fire?                                       TED                          No, it s out.                                       BETTY                          Good, sprinkler system worked like a                           charm. Now, you wanna leave, you ve                           had enough. Perfectly understandable.                           I ll take care of everything else.                           The only thing I ask is that you                           take care of Chester Rush. Then you                           can leave.                                       TED                          Now, look --                                       BETTY                          Ted, he s a very important guest of                           this hotel. In fact, he is the most                           important guest at the hotel. The                           Mon Signor used to be a haven for                           movie stars. Through the thirties                           and forties, and the first half of                           the fifties, more movie stars -- if                           you break it down on a night-by-night                           basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor                           than any other hotel in Hollywood.                           Now, we had some hard time in the                           eighties, even though we were the                           official hotel of Cannon Pictures,                           but we re coming back strong in the                           nineties. And a movie star clientele                           is important to that comeback. If we                           can keep stars of his magnitude happy,                           we re on our way. So, Ted, just take                           care of him, then you can leave.                                       TED                          Look, I don t feel like --                                       BETTY                          He probably just wants some champagne!                           You can do that, can t you? Please                           just take care of him, the entire                           staff of the Mon Signor is begging                           you!                 Ted crumbles.                                       TED                          Okay. But get your ass here pronto.                                       BETTY                          You re a good man, Ted. Thanks.                 Ted hangs up the phone. And picks up the board phone.                                       TED                          Hello, Mr. Rush. Sorry for the delay.                           How can I help you?                 FADE TO BLACK                 STORY TITLE CARD:                                        THE PENTHOUSE                                   THE MAN FROM HOLLYWOOD                  EXT. HALLWAY TO PENTHOUSE--NIGHT                 The elevator door opens and Ted wheels out his tray into the                 hallway.                 There s been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit                 less disheveled than in the last scene. He s only minorly                 successful in the attempt. His uniform still looks like shit,                 his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp.                 He wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and KNOCKS at                 the door.                 A woman opens the door, it s Angela from Alex s story.                                       ANGELA                          Hi, Theodore.                                       TED                          What the hell are you doing here?                 She holds up the drink she has in her hand.                                       ANGELA                          Having a drink.

ANGELA                          Are you kidding, he ll be asleep                           till Christmas.                 From behind her we hear:                                       VOICE (O.S.)                          Entrez, entrez.                 Angela steps aside and Ted wheels in the tray.                 INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT                 The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the                 house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the                 hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the                 Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this                 moment in time, he s the king, and he has the swagger of a                 new king. After only one movie, he s pulled the sword out of                 the stone. And the look on his face says,  King s good.                  Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once                 upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however,                 at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as                 Ted.                 One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair                 with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in                 his hand.                 The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back                 and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to                 the rest of the room s activity.                 In Chester s hand is an ever present glass of champagne,                 which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the                 room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers,                 and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.                                       CHESTER                               (still sitting)                          Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.                                       TED                               (wheeling in the tray)                          Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got                           everything you asked for --                                       CHESTER                          -- Not a problem, my friend Mr.                           Bellboy.                                       ANGELA                               (closing the door)                          His name s Theodore.                                       TED                          Actually, it s not Theodore,                               (he throws a look at                                Angela)                          It s Ted.                 Chester rises from the couch.                                       CHESTER                          So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying --                           would you care for some champagne?                           That s not what I was saying, but                           would you care for some champagne?                                       TED                          No, thank you.                                       CHESTER                          Ya sure? Cristal. It s the best. I                           never liked champagne before I had                           Cristal, now I love it.                                       TED                          Okay, yeah, sure.                 As Chester goes and pours Ted a glass:                                       CHESTER                          -- As I was saying, Ted, don t worry                           about being late. For our purposes,                           promptness is far behind thoroughness.                 On  thoroughness,  he hands Ted the glass.                                       CHESTER                          Chin-chin.                 They clink glasses and drink.

CHESTER                          No, not thank you. Whadya say about                           the tasty beverage?

TED                          It s fuckin  good.                                       CHESTER                          You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It s                           fuckin  Cristal, everything else is                           piss.                 Norman in the chair starts yelling at Ted.                                       NORMAN                          Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy!                 Ted knows he s being laughed at, but not why.                                       CHESTER                               (to Norman)                          Knock it off, you re making my friend                           Ted here uneasy.                               (to Ted)                          Pay no attention to Norman here,                           Ted, he s just fuckin  wit  ya, that s                           all. That s from Quadrophenia. Now                           me, myself, when I think of bellboys                           I think of --  bellboy  isn t an                           insult, is it? Is there another name                           for what you do that I m ignorant                           of? Bellman, bellperson --                                       TED                          Bellboy s fine.                                       CHESTER                          Good. I m glad they haven t changed                           that. There s a friendliness to                            bellboy.  As I was saying, Ted,                           when Norman thinks of bellboys, he                           thinks of Quadrophenia.                 But me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy,                 with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy?                                       TED                          No.                                       CHESTER                          You should, it s one of Jerry s better                           movies. He never says a word through                           the entire film. A completely silent                           performance. How many actors can                           pull that off? And he has to go to                           France to get respect. That says it                           all about America right there. The                           minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper                           in this fuckin  country gonna write                           articles calling the man a genius.                           It s not right. It s not right and                           it s not fair. But why should that                           surprise anybody? When has America                           ever been fair? We might be right                           every once in a while, but we re                           very rarely fair.

(to Leo)                          Leo, say hello to Ted.                 Leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds.                                       LEO                          Hi, Ted, glad you could make it.                               (back to phone)                          What?

CHESTER                          Which brings me to me, Chester Rush,                           Ted. Pleased to meetcha.                 Chester shakes Ted s hand.                                       TED                          I know. I m sorry I haven t seen                           your movie.                 Chester stops.                 Ted wonders if he should have said that.                 Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more                 champagne. When he talks now it s slower and somewhat                 distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.                                       CHESTER                          It s quite all right, Ted, nothing                           to feel sorry about. That s why God                           invented video. But you know, Ted, a                           lot of people did see it.                 Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses                 his face, and he slowly puts it down.                 His manner gives the room a chill.                 When he talks, he addresses the room.                                       CHESTER                          Who drank out of this bottle last?                 No answer.                 Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.                                       CHESTER                          Who drank out of this bottle -- not                           the other bottles -- this bottle                           last?                                       NORMAN                          What s wrong, Chester?                 He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.                                       CHESTER                          It s fuckin  flat, Norman, that s                           what s wrong. The champagne -- the                           fuckin  Cristal s fuckin  flat.                 Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat Cristal.                 Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo                 walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little                 frightened.                 When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention                 back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle.                 But it s not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so                 far. It s more troubled and distracted.                                       CHESTER                          I was saying, Ted, a lot of people                           did see it. And not just on video,                           either. Leo, what was the final take                           on domestic?                 Leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy s cool.                                       LEO                          72.1 million.                               (worried tone)                          You okay, champ?                                       CHESTER                               (struggling with bottle)                          I m cool, so talk to your wife.                 Leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside                 the room.                                       CHESTER                               (to Ted)                          72.1 million dollars. That s before                           video and before foreign, and before                           pay-TV and before free TV.

The tantrum s over, and Chester s back to his fast-talking,                 good-natured self.

So if fate doesn t smile                           on ol  Norman, we ll put his finger                           on ice and rush  im to a hospital,                           where in all likelihood be able to                           sew it back on.                                       TED                          Hopefully.                                       LEO                          Eighty percent.                                       NORMAN                          Our side.                                       CHESTER                          So Norman s protected. His interests                           have been looked after. My interests,                           on the other hand, have not. I am as                           emotionally attached to my car as                           Norman is physically to his finger.                           I m putting up a very expensive piece                           of machinery on this wager. Now, if                           I lose, I lose, I have no problem                           with that. I m a big boy, I knew                           what I was doing. However, if I win,                           I wanna win. If Norman lights his                           lighter ten times in a row, he s                           gonna have no emotional problems                           about taking my car keys whatsoever.                           But if I win, it s not inconceivable                           that Leo or myself, at the last                           minute, might not be able to wield                           the ax. Which brings us full circle                           to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed                           Ted. We want you to be the diceman.                 Pause as they all look at him. Angela breaks it.                                       ANGELA                          Helluva night, huh, Ted?                                       TED                          I gotta get out of here.                 Ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door.                 Chester whips out a hundred-dollar bill and quickly calls to                 Ted from his position at the bar.                                       CHESTER                          Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill                           here with your name on it, whether                           you do what we ask or not, just to                           sit back down in the chair for one                           minute more.                 Ted spins in his direction.                                       TED                          I m not gonna cut off his finger!                                       CHESTER                          Maybe you will and maybe you won t,                           but that has nothing to do with this                           hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You                           can tell us all to go fuck off and                           walk right out that door. But if you                           sit back down and wait sixty seconds                           before you do it, you ll be a hundred                           dollars richer.                 Ted just stands across the room, thinking.                                       ANGELA                          Ted. Take the money.                                       LEO                          Ted, you re gonna do whatever you                           want to do. We re just askin  you to                           indulge us for another minute more.                           And Chester s willin  to pay for it.                 Ted thinks.                                       TED                          I ll take your money, and I ll sit                           back down. But a minute from now,                           I m gonna walk out the door, and                           when I do, there ll be no hard                           feelings?                                       CHESTER                          Well, I want you to have a bit more                           of an open mind than that, but, yeah,                           we ll either convince you or we won t.                           No hard feelings. Right, guys?                 Everybody agrees.                 Ted wearily sits back down.                 Chester positions himself in front of Ted at the bar.                                       CHESTER                          Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper.

Norman lays his                 left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out.                 In his right hand is his Zippo lighter, poised and ready to                 strike.                 Chester hands Ted the meat cleaver.

Takes a breath.                 And strikes.                 It sparks, but doesn t light.                 Without missing a beat, Ted brings down the cleaver, slicing                 off Norman s pinky.                 Norman lets out a scream.                 Ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money                 and walks out the door.                 INT. HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN                 CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it                 at the elevator at the other end.                 Ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. In a MEDIUM SHOT,                 he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it,                 smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. It might ve been a bad                 night, but it s been a profitable one. He chuckles at the                 irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the                 camera and walks down the hall to the elevator.                 All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind the                 door.                 As Ted walks to the elevator, the CREDITS ROLL. He waits for                 the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close.                 As CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL, we hold for about two beats...                 then...                 The door BURSTS open and everybody comes piling out.                 Everybody s screaming, yelling different things to one                 another. Norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand,                 he s screaming and crying.                                       NORMAN                          My finger, my fucking finger!!                 Chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. Leo s                 trying to direct everything. Everybody s in frantic activity,                 except for Angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and                 watches the show. They all run down the hall, toward the                 elevator. Somebody trips and they all hit the ground. The                 bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. They run around                 like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes.                 Norman lies on the floor and screams. They pick it all up,                 get to the elevator, and push the button.                 When it arrives, they all dive in except for Angela.                                       ANGELA                          You know, I m gonna call it a night                           and go back to my room. It s been                           fun.                 The doors close on the screaming maniacs.                 Angela walks through a door marked  Stairway.

The look on her face combines strange                 awe and mild shock.                 Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell,                 wearing Diana s see-through negligee and slippers, armed                 with Elspeth s sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward                 her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.                                       ANGELA                          You okay, lady?

Angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect                 through the eyes.                 Having had enough emotional intensity tonight, Angela breaks                 their eye contact.                                       ANGELA                          Lady, I haven t seen anybody.                 Diana quietly says,  Ohhh,  as she drifts on down the hall                 in a daze. Angela puts her hand to her temples before opening                 her hotel door. She does a double-take on the hallway --                 empty.                 She pauses a beat, then walks into her room. After the door                 closes, we hear Sigfried on the other side.

Skinny and      intense. His eyes opaque and piercing at the same time.      At once unassuming and terrifying. A plastic bag of      fresh green roots in his lap. Ghat. Miraa. African      cocaine. His teeth black from chewing it.                                  KEVIN                   Mr. Moyez?                          (as he nods)                   We ve never met.

We are                   not Voodoo. Candomble.                   Obeayisne. None of that. We are                   much older. Before. Before all                   of it.                                   KEVIN                   Okay.   Is there a name?   Or...                                  MOYEZ                   We have papers.

KEVIN                   Look, Mr. Moyez, I m going to need                   your help with this.

Moyez, ignoring him, moves to an old refrigerator beside      the stairs. For an instant, the door is open -- just a      glimpse. Meat. Bags of entrails. Jars of blood. Moyez      goes to a workbench near the wall --                                   KEVIN                   Mr. Moyez?

Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers.        A      huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are      scattered around it.

U.S.D.A. approved and stamped.                 Eight days ago, in Kansas City,                 two men pushed a calf into a steel                 frame as a third man fired a high-                 voltage staple-gun into the                 animal s skull. Men kill animals                 and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez                 killed a goat. He killed a goat.                 And he did it at home, in a manner                 consistent with his religious                 beliefs. Now some people may find                 it bizarre.

It s not as common as, say,                   circumcision. It s certainly not                   as common as the belief that wine                   is transformed into blood. It s                   not even as common as the handling                   of poisonous snakes to prove one s                   faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn t                   two thousand miles away in a                   stockyard. He doesn t use                   electricity to kill.

I don t see a whole lot                   of pro bono work in your                   immediate future.

You gotta hear that on your own.                   It s gotta be in your blood. It s                   molecular. I bet I ve got five                   thousand lawyers working around                   the planet. I couldn t name                   ten -- couldn t name three --                   I d trust with Moyez.

They re                   corporate lawyers, what do                   you think they re doing? They re                   busy reducing life and death to                   the proper position of a semi-                   colon. They re doing needlepoint.                   Push button battles. Push button                   wars. Armies that get so fucking                   far away from each other they                   need satellites to tell them                   who won. No pain. No sound.                   No smell. One big, multinational                   circle jerk. You, on the other                   hand, you re on the slaughterhouse                   floor.

Look at me --                   I ve been underestimated from                   day one. Do I look like a                   master of the universe?

It s me. And she smiles -- it s                   like a veil coming down across                   her face -- and that smile, that s                   a question mark, because she s                   looking at me, she s wondering,                   how did that happen? And see,                   right there, from that moment on,                   she s got a secret. I m the hand                   up Mona Lisa s skirt. I m the                   whisper in Nefertitti s ear.                   I m a surprise. They never see                   me coming. That s what you re                   missing.

And when all that evidence is                  laid before you, when all these                  pieces weave together, you will                  conclude -- you will know -- that                  Alexander Cullen is guilty of                  murdering three people in cold                  blood with malice aforethought.

KEVIN                  If it s a choice, I ll go now. I                  won t be as long as Mr. Broygo.                                 JUDGE POE                  Proceed.                                 KEVIN                  We just spent our morning listening                  to Mr. Broygo talk about his                   evidence . What he neglected to                  tell you is what this case is                  really about. He left out the most                  important fact of all: Alex Cullen                  was somewhere else when these                  murders took place. Now, Alex                  Cullen has done a lot of things I                  don t like. He s been a terrible                  husband to all three of his wives.                  He s been a destructive force in                  the lives of his step-children.                  He s cheated the city. His partners.                  His employees. He s paid hundreds of                  thousands of dollars in penalties and                  fines over the years. I don t like                  those things. I don t expect you to                  like them. There will be other things                  during the course of this trial that                  you will hear about and like even                  less.

And that                    just stopped me cold because we d                    spent that whole day at Bible study                    reading Matthew Ten and there was                    just no way for him to know about                    that, so I was... I took it as a                    sign. I let him in. And then                    everything was different. He was                    cruel.

Kevin alone with the mirror and his       reflection.        And then it s over. He s made his decision. Replacing       his wedding ring.

A       single empty seat.        Kevin moving quickly down the aisle.        Mary Ann standing there, completely unprepared as Kevin       comes in behind her. Embracing her. Holding her tightly       to him with a fervor that we alone will understand.                                   MARY ANN                    Honey, what are you doing?

(SINGING)            Winds in the East            Mist coming in--                           FADE IN:           A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,           spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst           white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)           dances amongst the nimbus.             TRAVERS (V.O.)            --Like something is brewing,            about to begin--           The shadow s direction becomes purposeful - taking us down           through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small           town in the distance.             TRAVERS (V.O.)            --Can t put me finger on what lies                            IN STORE--           Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,           bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.           There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts           the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large           park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from           flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.           She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face           to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her           concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we           will also know as GINTY.)

INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)            P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position           as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the           sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of           stiff and steely determination.           Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha           smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the           walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with           men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit           on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.           Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,           white.           Downstairs the doorbell rings.           Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.           It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,           smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.            INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING            Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of           sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.

(BEAT)            It s an exploratory trip--           Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away           from the tree and sticks to her living room window.                            DIARMUID (CONT D)            What do you say?                            PAMELA                            (TO HERSELF)            I want to keep my house.                                       EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY            A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and           smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild           poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.                            TRAVERS            Excuse me ma am, have you seen my            daughter? I was quite sure I had            left her around here somewhere!           Ginty giggles.

GINTY            It s me!           Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her           face.                            TRAVERS            Gosh! So it is! Well, thank            goodness for that!

He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through           the park, neighing like a horse.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Hurry now! We mustn t be late! The            adventure is about to begin!                                       INT. PLANE - DAY            Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet           bag into an overhead locker.                            FLIGHT ATTENDANT            Can I help you?                            PAMELA            I m perfectly capable thank you.           The flight attendant tries to help anyway.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            They ve used all the space; so            greedy.           She glares at the people around her.                            FLIGHT ATTENDANT            I ll take it Madam. I can put it            up here -                            PAMELA            I don t want it up there. I want it            here, in the corresponding holding            area for my assigned seat!                            FLIGHT ATTENDANT            The flight s closing in just a few            moments Ma am. I ll have to take            it.           Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare           you.  A woman, with an infant, stands up.

The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the           woman s bag with Pamela s.                            PAMELA                            (TO WOMAN)            Will the child be a nuisance? It s            an eleven hour flight.

Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to           the window, she looks out at the tarmac.           She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes           again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands           neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.                            PAMELA (CONT D)                            (TO HERSELF)            I hope we crash.

GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906)            BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -           stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases           bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as           she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from           his shoulders and plops her on the ground.                            MARGARET            The carriage?                            TRAVERS            Who needs a carriage my love? A            stroll is a gift!

She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away,           heartbroken.                            TRAVERS            Walking bus!           The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in           the lead.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Don t forget Andrew!           Ginty takes Andrew s leash, her own case and somehow helps           her sister too.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Ready? And off we go!

Coming            through!           Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a           picture of the home she leaves behind.                                       EXT. DOWNTOWN MARYBOROUGH - DAY            The procession continues into the bustling downtown.            EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY            It s hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a           chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks           at the list. The last city is--                            GINTY                            ALLORA--                                       EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY            The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward           from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake           of Allora.                                       EXT. ANGLE ON MARYBOROUGH - DAY            As it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,           watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.           Ginty s face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede           as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.                                       INT. PLANE - DAY            Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She s disturbed           by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if           somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs           her heel into the carpet of the plane.                                       INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY            A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals           area. She s immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of           signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:           she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling           upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath  Walt Disney           Presents .                            PAMELA            Oh does he indeed?           She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on           his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.                            RALPH            Travers? P.L. Travers?                            PAMELA            Mrs.                            RALPH            Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome            to the City of Angels.           Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.                            RALPH (CONT D)            Let me take those.                            PAMELA            I m perfectly capable of-- Oh,            nevermind.           Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--                                       EXT. LAX - DAY            --and into the sunlight.

PAMELA (CONT D)            It smells. Like--                            RALPH            Jasmine.                            PAMELA            --chlorine and sweat.           Ralph chuckles.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            It s dreadful.                                       EXT. LIMOSINE - DAY            The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega           Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish           billboard advertising.                                       INT. LIMOSINE - DAY            Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car.           She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-           car bar.                            PAMELA                            (TO HERSELF)            Absurd.           Ralph looks at her in the rearview.                            RALPH            You okay back there Mrs P.L.            Travers?                            PAMELA            It s not Mrs P.L. It s just Mrs--            Oh, it s so hot.                            RALPH            No problemo! We got a brand new air            conditioning system, Missus; cool            you right down in no time. Just            about make you feel like you re in            good old Engerland again! Things            they can put in cars these days--            (he shakes his head in                            AMAZEMENT)            Gosh almighty.           Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around,           finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between           passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph s           natter.                            RALPH (CONT D)            (happy as a clam)            No problemo.                                       EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY            With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel           resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.           The limo glides into the forecourt.                                       INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY            A porter opens the door to Pamela s suite and places her           belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.                            PORTER            Would you like me to unpack for you            ma am?                            PAMELA            Unpack?                            PORTER            To take your items from their cases            and hang them in the wardrobe            ma am.                            PAMELA            Young man, if it is your wish to            handle ladies garments I suggest            you take employment in a            launderette.           The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Yes?           His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She           closes the door on him.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Odd.           She turns and for the first time takes in--                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Oh my.           --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent           beyond imagine but it s classy decor has been rather           diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across           every surface of the room.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Oh no, no, no.           Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit           baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald,           Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the           BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.            BIGGER!           Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust           for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the           fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing           over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands           before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            (muttering to the pears)            This won t do.           She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is           greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--                                       EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY            --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the           children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From           their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling           red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new           home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush           greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.           A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few           skinny chickens strut about the porch.                            TRAVERS            A palace! Complete with mighty            steed.                            GINTY            And chickens.

TRAVERS            We ll build beautiful memories here            my angel.           Margaret offers him a trusting smile.                            MARGARET            Yes.           Travers takes Ginty and Biddy s hands and they run towards           their new home. The chickens scatter.                            TRAVERS            (in the distance)            --in this house you get to share a            bedroom!           Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there s simply           nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.                                       EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY                            UNDERWATER           SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then           another SPLOSH!           We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony           throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free           swimming pool.                                       INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS                             PAMELA            Good riddance.           She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.                            PAMELA (CONT D)                            (TO HERSELF)            Well, first things first.           She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in           a closet.           She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where           the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the           entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER!                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Good Lord.           Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the           floor, facing the wall.                            PAMELA (CONT D)                            (TO MICKEY)            And you can stay there until you            learn the art of subtlety.           Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes           from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night           stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.           The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,           the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come           streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses           windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature           Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed           picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down           an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            There.           Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in           front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns           her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans           forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly           unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.                            PAMELA (CONT D)                            (SATISFIED)            Yes.            (answering an imaginary                            QUESTION)            Well, no, I don t suppose I do            mind.           She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as           an ugly snort.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Now, really! Flatterer!            (then scolding herself)            Silly girl.           She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a           remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it           at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the           TV bursts into life.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Oh!           She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it s on. A           housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is           the greatest thing ever invented.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Soap for the brains.           She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a           black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes           that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly           face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of           Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Well, well-- There you are.

This is a            pixie bell, the sound is much too            high for human ears.           Tinkerbell flies into shot.                            WALT (CONT D)            Oh there you are Tink!           She covers Walt in fairy dust.                            WALT (CONT D)                            (LAUGHING)            Hey!

Pamela can t help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then           just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and           switches him off.                            PAMELA            Off! That s how we deal with you.                                       EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL            A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door.            INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT            Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes           her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.           The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her           bed.                                       EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING            Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,           not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and           Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car           and rush round to open the passenger door.                            RALPH            Good morning Mrs!                            PAMELA            It s not Mrs, it s-- Oh, why do I            bother?

PAMELA            (as much to herself as                            RALPH)            I would so much rather be            accountable for the rain.

They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT           (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has           a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.           Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help           her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.                            DON            Pamela! Good morning!                            PAMELA            It is so discomfiting to hear a            perfect stranger use my first name.            Mrs Travers. Please.

No. Certainly not a            musical. Now, where is Mister            Disney? I d very much like to get            this started and finished as            briskly as is humanly possible.                            BOB            Don?

EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY            The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios           on a golf buggy.                            PAMELA            I am perfectly capable of walking.           A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to           the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to           Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Shoo! Go away!

Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and           picks up the phone.

It s just that he can t            stand being called Mr Disney. We            are all on a first name basis here.                            (TO DOLLY)            Dolly! Is he--?           We hear a man s cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the           flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms           outstretched.                            WALT            Well, there ya are at last!           Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way           serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to           greet her.                            WALT (CONT D)            Oh my dear gal!           Pamela is open mouthed.                            WALT (CONT D)            You can t imagine how excited I am            to finally meet you!           Pamela doesn t know what to do with this amount of           enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to           get her in an embrace.                            PAMELA            Oh!           He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to           compose herself, she hasn t been that close to a man in           decades!                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Hum-- ah. It s an honour, Mister            Disney.           Disney winces.                            WALT            Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya            know. `Mister Disney  was my old            man.

He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads           her into his interior office past an imposing floor to           ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.

DISNEY S OFFICE - DAY            Disney s office is tastefully furnished and filled with           pictures of his daughters and wife. Framed posters of his           films provide splashes of color to the cream walls.                            WALT            Have a seat, sit down.           He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a           seat in front of Walt s desk instead, glancing at the sign           above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of           the desk, close to her, gazing at her.                            WALT (CONT D)            Ya know, I can t believe it. P.L.

I could eat you up!                            PAMELA            That wouldn t be appropriate.           He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to           face Pamela.                            WALT            When Diane here was seven years old            I-- can I get you a drink?

Anyways I asked them             Girls, what s so funny?  And Diane            said to me,  Mary Poppins daddy!             Well, I had no idea what a Mary            Poppins was! And then she gave me            your book. And by gosh!           He stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his           point.

WALT (CONT D)            I got old asking.           He sits back down on his desk.                            PAMELA            What a charming story.

Tommie places the tray on Walt s desk and leaves the room.           Walt picks up the tea pot.                            PAMELA            Yes, this singing, I am glad you ve            come to that.            (addressing his tea                            MAKING)            Milk first!

PAMELA            No.           She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any           good.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary            Poppins does not sing.                            WALT            Oh yes she does!                            PAMELA            When?

Singing is            frivolous and wholly unnecessary            for a governess, an educatress. No.            It would just ruin it.           Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it s disgusting, he           spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs           loudly. Pamela s jaw drops.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            I won t have her turned into one of            your silly cartoons.

You just listen to            what my Sherman boys have come up            with and if they don t knock your            socks off then I m the King of            England.

He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her           teacup, it s awkward.                            WALT (CONT D)            (gazing into her eyes)            The pages are worn down to tissue,            dog eared and falling out. I have            poured over them gripped,            tormented.

Ugh, It s so vulgar.           She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the           table and plops it on top of Dick s piano. Bob moves it from           the piano to the floor.                            BOB                            (SEETHING)            That is a very expensive piano.                            PAMELA            And these are beautiful blooms            butchered for our visual and nasal            enjoyment when we could have just            as easily gone to the window,            looked out and gazed upon them            happily minding their own business            and very much still alive.           Bob hasn t a clue what to say. Pamela smoothes down her skirt           and re-takes her seat.           Everybody waits.

DON            It does seem strange that Mrs Banks            allows her children to spend all of            their time with the nanny when she            has no job to speak of--                            PAMELA            Are you calling Mrs Banks            neglectful?                            BOB            Yep.                            DON            No! Of course not! We just felt            that if she had a job it would go            some way to explaining--                            PAMELA            Being a mother is a job. A very            difficult job and one that not            everybody is up to, that not            everybody should have taken on in            the first place!           The boys see that Pamela is talking about something           meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief           moment, until--                            PAMELA (CONT D)            I will NOT have her called Cynthia!            Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.           Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            No it should be something warm, a            bit sexy.           They all nearly choke at the word `sexy  coming out of her           mouth.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            How about Mavis?                            DON            Sybil?                            BOB            Sure.                            PAMELA            Prudence?                            DICK            Gwendolyn?                            BOB            Great.                            PAMELA            Winifred!                            DON            I could go with Winifred.                            PAMELA            Yes, that s because it s very good.           She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of           it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            This isn t Mr Banks?           She turns to face Don and the boys.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            This isn t him.                            DON            Ahm, yeah, that s him--                            PAMELA            He has a set of moustaches!                            DON            In the books he--                            PAMELA            I told the illustrator I didn t            like the facial hair but she chose            to ignore me. This is MY film and            this time around I shall have MY            way.                            DOLLY            (clearing her throat)            Mrs Travers, it was a specific            request, from Walt.           Pamela doesn t acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly           flushes.                            PAMELA            (to the boys)            Why?           Everyone shrugs, they don t know why.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            He didn t, he doesn t, Mr Banks is            clean shaven!           Bob buries his face in his hands and let s out a long, loud,           unashamed moan.                            BOB            Does it mattterrrrrrr?!                            DON            Bob, Bob, Bob--           Pamela stares at Bob.                            PAMELA            You can wait outside!           She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob           is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            I shan t say it again Robert.           Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will           allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:             BOB (O.S.)             KILL ME! KILL ME NOW!                            PAMELA                            (TO DICK)            What is wrong with his leg?                            DICK            He got shot.                            PAMELA            Hardly surprising.           Pamela smiles sweetly.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Can I expect anymore drama from            anyone else?                                       INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON            Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies           the bar, full of people laughing, exclaiming, enjoying one           another s company. She takes it in melancholically for a           second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly, relieved           when the doors finally slide open.                                       INT. GOFF HOUSE - WASHROOM - ALLORA - MORNING            Travers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on           from the doorway. He picks up his razor and begins to scrape           away the stubble.                            GINTY            Why do you do that?                            TRAVERS            For you my dear!            (he flicks the blade in            the air like a swordsman)            Swish! Which kind of kisses do you            prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy            ones or silky ones?                            GINTY                            (THINKS)            Silky ones.            A man must shave for to spare his            daughter s cheeks! Swish!                                       INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING            Pamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror. She           runs a finger through the steam on the glass.                            PAMELA            Swish.           And again.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Swoosh.            INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY            Dolly, carrying a tray of cakes, stops at the rehearsal room           door where fractious voices ring out.             PAMELA (O.S.)            Stop! Stop! Stop! What on earth are            you talking about? Supercali--?            Supercali-- or whatever the            infernal thing is!                            DICK            It s something to say when you            don t know what to say!                            PAMELA            Well I always know what to say.           The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with           her foot.             PAMELA (O.S.) (CONT D)            If you so much as step one foot in            here with that tray I shall scream!            One cannot live on cake alone!                                       INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY            Dolly stands in Disney s office.                            DISNEY            Hit me with it.                            DOLLY            She has a lot of-- ideas.                            DISNEY            Ya? What kind of ideas?                            DOLLY            About how she, uh, sees things.                            DISNEY            And just how does she `see  things?           Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad.                            DOLLY                            (READING)            The name Cynthia has been changed            to Winifred.                            WALT            Okay that ll work.                            DOLLY            She won t approve Dick Van Dyke.           Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too.                            DOLLY (CONT D)            The sketches of the Banks house            make it look too opulent, there            must be no hint of romance between            Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to            know why Mr Banks has been given a            moustache, the--                            WALT            I asked for that.                            DOLLY            Yes. They did tell her but she            wants to know why.                            WALT            Because I asked for it.                            DOLLY            Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape            measure Mary Poppins uses to record            Jane and Micheal s height must be a            roll tape, not a ruler, we must add            gravi-- gravitas, she says.                            DISNEY            Gahd! Anything else?                            DOLLY            She only wants green vegetables and            broth, I don t know what that is            but she wants it in the room from            now on and oh! She doesn t want the            colour red in the film-- at all.                                       INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY            Dick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table. Bob hovers           by the door in a right humph. Disney prefers to stand,           grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy.                            PAMELA            I ve simply gone off the colour.           Their mouths are agape.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            You did say I was to have final say            did you not?                            DISNEY            We can t make the film without the            colour red! It s set in London for            pete s sake.                            PAMELA            And?                            DISNEY            There s buses and mail boxes and            guards uniforms-- heck! The British            flag! Pamela, I m not sure why                            YOU RE--                            PAMELA            I understand your predicament Mr            Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don t            know what it is, I m just suddenly            very anti-red. I shan t be wearing            it ever again.           Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks           eyes with her.                            DISNEY            Is this a test Pam? Are you            requiring proof of how badly I            wanna make you happy so that we can            create this beautiful thing            together?           Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about           `creating something beautiful  with Walt, but quickly           recovers and eyeballs him right back.                            PAMELA            I took you at your word Mr Disney            and it seems my first stipulation            has been denied. There will be many            more, so-- perhaps we should just            call it quits and I should hand you            back these?           She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it           to him.           Disney smiles at Pamela.                            DISNEY            Alright. No red in the film.           Pamela glances at the tape recorder.                            DON            What?!                            DICK            Walt?           Don and the Shermans can t believe he has given in! Disney           strides out of the room.            INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS            Disney marches down the corridor away from the rehearsal           room. He stops, turns, goes back to the door, puts his hand           on the handle, stops himself and moves on.                                       INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS            Dick, Don and Bob are left astounded. They look at one           another.                            BOB            He doesn t have the rights--           All three turn their heads to turn to her.                            PAMELA            Quite.           Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths           down her skirt and opens the script.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Now, If you re insisting upon this            musicality you feel is SO important            for my film then I suggest I hear            one of your ditties.           No one is in the mood to sing for her.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            I shall keep an open mind!                            DICK            Nanny?                            DON            Yeah, do nanny.           Dick begins to play--                            BOB                            (SPOKEN)            Wanted a nanny for two adorable            children.           Pamela sighs, so do Don and Bob.             DICK (CONT D) PAMELA           If you want this choice (expecting Dick to stop)           position, No no! They can t make deman--           have a cheery disposition--                                      But Dick ignores her and carries on.

DICK (CONT D) PAMELA           Sing songs, bring sweets No sweets!

DISNEY S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON            Walt stands looking out of his window.                           DISNEY POV:           Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms           clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits           perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out,           patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her.           Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the           back door for her and she climbs in.                            WALT            Tommie!           Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to           Walt.                            TOMMIE            Scotch Mist.

BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON            Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies           the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The           elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar           instead.                            BARMAN            Good afternoon Ma am. What can I            fix you?                            PAMELA            A pot of tea.                            BARMAN            Sure thing.           Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all           glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs           Travers.           The tea pot arrives.                            PAMELA            Thank you. Tea is a balm for the            soul don t you agree?           But the barman has already moved on to another patron.           Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come           and go. The barman talks with another customer further along           the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks           like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring           into her empty cup.                                       EXT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - DAY            Ginty - in a rather tattered school uniform - is diminutive           in front of the huge double doors to the bank. An upright,           top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open           chivalrously for her.                                       INT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS            Ginty and the man enter the bank.                            GINTY            Thank you.           A bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman.                            BANK WORKER            Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett.           Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously.           Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a           loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers            office. The etching on the glass reads:            TRAVERS GOFF - BANK MANAGER                                       INT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY            Travers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on           the floor. He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been           drinking.                            TRAVERS                            (TO CLERK)            Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha!            It s a ridiculous moniker!                            CLERK                            SIR--                            TRAVERS            And Mr Belhatchett has complained            that I opened his stupid bank five            minutes late has he? Hahaaa!            (in a comedy voice)            Time s Money, Goff, y know! Time s            money my man!           The clerk laughs nervously.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet.            That s what it means. And I suppose            if the poor dumb lambs on his            downs, are five minutes late with            their calving, or they don t drop            dead on schedule when he wants a            roast, he takes to them with the            business end of his beautiful            hatchet.           Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing           piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            There, whack! That ll teach you for            not dropping your bairns on            schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack!           Travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his           eyes widen.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Whack. Whoops!            (through the door)            Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to--           Travers pushes the door open to reveal Ginty at his side and           is felled.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Ginty!                            RANDOLPH            I want you gone.           All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to           have forgotten. Travers is overcome with embarrassment and           guilt.                            TRAVERS            Sweet thing! What are you doing            here?           Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.                            GINTY            You said today was--                            TRAVERS            Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What            kind of father am I?                            GINTY                            (SCARED)            Are you fired again?                            TRAVERS            Ah, yes it does seem that--                            RANDOLPH                            (TO GINTY)            No. No sweetheart-- he isn t.                            TRAVERS                            (TO GINTY)            Just wait in my office for a second            darling.           Randolph walks away, stopping to whisper in Travers ear.                            RANDOLPH            If you can t straighten up for your            own sake. Do it for your daughter.            (muttering to himself)            Irresponsible.           Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them.                            TRAVERS            Ice cream is so rare because it            only comes from Siberian cows. Did            you know that?!                            (BEAT)            Brrrrrrrr!                                       EXT. RIVER - ALLORA - DAY            Ginty and Travers sit by the river. Ginty eats an enormous           ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask.                            TRAVERS            We share a Celtic soul, you and I.            This world is just an illusion,            Ginty old girl. As long as we hold            that thought dear, they can t break            us. Money, money, money. Don t you            buy into it Ginty! It ll bite you            on the bot!            How did we end up here eh? Look at            it. Barren. Breathless.            Get as far away from this place as            possible my love. Find yourself a            patch of green.                            (HE SIGHS)            It s a chimera you know? The world,            the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-            whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an            illusion.           He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep           melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound           unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.            EXT.

PAMELA                            (INTO PHONE)            I loathe this place, Mr Russell.            How can a place so sunny be so            cold?           We don t hear what Diarmuid says.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            I meant heartless. I m afraid a            jumper wouldn t suffice. It s            bringing up these-- it s so hot and            stuffy I feel like I am being            attacked. These odd dreams, like my            subconscious is after me. Punishing            me for entertaining the idea that I            might hand her over. I am at war            with myself Mr Russell.

(BEAT)            Very well. Good morning and            goodnight.           She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright. Wide           awake. Staring into the darkness.           Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for           something to help her. Nothing. She groans as she drags           herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Serves me right. Money, money,            money. Bit me on the bot.           Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the           bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto           the stuffed toy for comfort.            INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING            The room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of the cast           and models of the sets all about the place. And of course,           the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now           accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a           fluorescent looking soup.           Bob and Dick are at the piano. Don sits in the corner,           sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a           cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers.                            DICK            It s gotta be like a slogan!                            BOB            Her prescription for life.                            DICK            Yeah! Yes!

PAMELA            I m sure your country doesn t have            any laws about sharing a pavement.           As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the           rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.                                       INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING            Dick is playing about with a verse.                            BOB            Go back to the chorus.

She always does what s            unexpected.            She goes UP the bannisters.           Dick is confused.                            BOB (CONT D)            So go up.

Don looks up from his sketching.                            DICK            Yes!           The sound of Walt s cough signals his imminent arrival.                            DON            Man is in the forest.           Pamela and Walt enter the room.                            DON (CONT D)                            (TO WALT)            I want you to hear this.            (to the boys)            Play him what you got.           Walt takes a seat beside the piano. Pamela folds her arms           across her chest defiantly.                            DICK            It s just a chorus--                            BOB            Tell us what you think.            He knows dum dum            Will help dum dum dum duuuum!           Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin s part of the           song.                            DICK                            (SINGING)            Just a spoonful of sugar helps the            medicine go down--            the medicine go do-own,            medicine go down            Just a spoonful of sugar            helps the medicine go down            In a most de da dee daaa!

DON            It s ironic.                            PAMELA            Is it?                            WALT            Forget ironic, it s iconic.           Pamela rolls her eyes.                            PAMELA                            (SARCASTIC)            Bravo.                            WALT            I won t be able to stop singing            that for weeks!                            PAMELA            It seems enormously patronising to            me. The very sort of annoying tune            you would have playing in your            themed park I daresay. All giddy            and carefree, encouraging children            to face the world unarmed. All they            need is a spoon and some sugar and            a brain full of fluff and they re            equipped with life s tools.            Wonderful!           Dick is completely deflated.                            WALT            What s your point Pam?                            PAMELA            MRS Travers! My point is that,            unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is            the very enemy of sentiment and            whimsy. She is truthful, she            doesn t sugar coat the darkness in            the world that these children will            eventually come to know. She            prepares them for it, she deals in            honesty. One must clean one s room;            it won t magically do it itself!           She waves the script in the air.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            This whole script is flim flam!            Where is its reality? Where is its            heart, where is the gravitas?           She opens a window and flings the script out.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            No weight Mister Disney! See?           Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter           downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.                            WALT            No whimsy or sentiment says the            woman who sends a flying nanny with            a talking umbrella to save the            children.                            PAMELA            You think Mary Poppins is saving            the children Mr Disney?           Pamela sighs, shakes her head.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Oh dear.                                       EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON            Pamela makes her way to the bench she waits on for Ralph.           She sits down, wraps her arms around herself, closes her           eyes.                            PAMELA                            (TO HERSELF)            It goes up.                                       EXT.

Shush shush now--           Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large           hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the           girls.                            MARGARET (CONT D)            (to the girls)            If you could just--                            TRAVERS                            (CALLING)            Ahoy Goffs!           The girls and Margaret look up, surprised to see Travers so           early.                            GINTY            Father!           She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one           arm, catching Biddy with the other.                            MARGARET            What a lovely surprise! Did you            finish early?

Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase           the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them           into the ground.                            MARGARET            Oh!                            TRAVERS            I ll wash them again my love!           Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.           The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the           poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in,           Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a           whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it           back inside - out of sight, out of mind.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!           Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and           scarpers. It s chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the           evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other,           cursing and laughing.                            GINTY            Aunt Ellie!                            TRAVERS            Oh she s a foul fowl!                                       INT. TRAVER S BEDROOM/CHILDREN S BEDROOM - EVENING            Biddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled           firmly under her arm. She can hear the tense voices of her           parents.

SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT            Pamela sits up in bed - leaning back into the open arms of           Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face           is screwed into a twist of unhappiness.                                       EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - NIGHT            Disney sits on Pamela s bench, deep in contemplation.           Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a                           VOICE--                            DICK            All around the cathedral            the saints and apostles            look down as she sells her wares           Walt is dragged from his thoughts and gets up to follow the           sound.                            DICK (CONT D)            Although you can t see it            you know they are smiling            Each time someone shows that he                            CARES--                                       INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK            Walt walks towards the music room, visibly moved by the song,           a cough rattling in his throat.            INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT            Also in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano. Bob asleep           on a couch in the corner. Walt pushes the door open, Dick           knows he s there but keeps tinkling away.                            DICK            Though her words are simple and few            listen, listen, she s calling to                            YOU--             Feed the birds, tuppence a bag            tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a            bag.

BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - NIGHT            Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at           the stars. The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the           water making it look like a chalk painting.             TRAVERS (V.O.)            The world is an illusion Ginty.                                       EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - LATE AFTERNOON            Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped           around her body, face to the sky.           The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last           deafening chorus of the birds.           Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit           jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His           shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of           something close to despair.           He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and           immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of           greeting.                            TRAVERS            Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick!            Pray tell me, what are you            concentrating so hard on?

MARGARET            Helen Goff, would you lay the table            for supper please?                            GINTY            I m not Helen!

Ginty           gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.           He swallows hard, eyes welling.                            TRAVERS            (urgent, his voice                            BREAKING)            Don t you ever stop dreaming Ginty            my love. You can be anyone you want            to be.

Ginty is unnerved by her Travers  demeanor, she creeps around           to the side of the house where she watches her father appears           in the window of the washroom. She doesn t know what to do as           he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.

Her arms wrapped           around her chest, her face turned to the window.                            RALPH            Ya alright Mrs?           Pamela doesn t even hear him.                                       INT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON            Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush           in her hand, dripping colour down her arm.           She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY.                            MRS CORRY            Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want            your banner to be ready for the            fair don t you?

REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING            Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on           what s going on in the room.

Margaret looks upset by this.             DICK (V.O.)            As your affluence expands--           Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them           to Ginty and Biddy.

On first glance she           sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers. Relief           begins to dawn and she turns away.           It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to           see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre.                            TRAVERS            Indeed, a published poet--           She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers           hand.                            GINTY            Father, come and look.

Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of           the bank staff.                            RANDOLPH            Why is he speaking for the bank?

REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS            The boys are laughing, congratulating one another.                            DON            I love it!                            DICK            You think Walt s gonna like it?           Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins           around viciously.                            PAMELA            Why did you have to make him so            cruel?           The boys jubilance is halted immediately.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            He was not a monster!                            DON            Who are we talking about? I m            confused.                            PAMELA            You all have children yes?                            DON            Yes.                            DICK BOB           Yep. Yes.                                                       PAMELA            And do those children write you            letters, make drawings for you?                            DON            Of course.                            DICK            Mine like to make folded paper--                            PAMELA            (cutting him off)            And would you tear up those gifts?            In front of them?!           Silence. They know where this is going.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            It s a dreadful thing to do! I            don t understand! Why must father            tear up the advertisement his            children have written and throw it            in the fireplace!? Why won t he            mend their kite? Why have you made            him so unspeakably awful?                            (BEAT)            For all the world to see, in            glorious technicolor? You claim to            make them live-- if that happens            can t he? Can t they at least live            well?           Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            I can t bear it.                            (SOFTLY)                            PLEASE DON T--           The boys are shocked at the level of upset.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Please don t-- I ll feel like I let            him down again--           She leaves the room, head hung.                                       INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY            Travers is in bed, his leg elevated and set with plaster. He           is shaking badly with DT s, his mood is poisonous.           Ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the DOCTOR packs up his           bag.                            TRAVERS            I don t suppose there s any more            you can give me for the pain?           The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more.                            DOCTOR            (leaving the room)            When will enough be enough Travers?                            GINTY            I ve brought you something father.                            TRAVERS            Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help            father out won t you?           Ginty is wary.                            TRAVERS (CONT D)            In my washroom-- there s a bottle            of medicine that father needs--                            GINTY            Mother took it away.           Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.                            TRAVERS            Godammit!           Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper           from her pocket.                            GINTY            I wrote a poem for you. It - it            won first prize, at school.           Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his           shaking hand.                            GINTY (CONT D)            Would you like me to read it to            you?           The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the           humiliation is too much for Travers. He scans the page           rapidly and lowers his hand.                            TRAVERS            It s hardly Yeats, is it?           Ginty is devastated. But more than this there s a hardening           in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far           she s held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela           to come.                                       INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY            Pamela rushes from the rehearsal room, down the corridor, her           face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure. Don           rushes out after her.                            DON            Mrs Travers!           He stops, recognizing she doesn t need to be followed.            INT. KITCHEN - GOFF HOUSE - DAY            Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash           but doesn t find what she s looking for.                                       EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY            Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the           lot, past Ralph - who s taking his lunch at the cafeteria -           and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of           a soundstage.                                       EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY            Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun           as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what           it is she s looking for.                                       EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY            Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into           the dirt and lawn.                                       INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY            Ginty creeps into her father s room, he sleeps fitfully, and           presses the half-full bottle into his hand. Covering both           hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room.                                       EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY            Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in           the grass.                            RALPH            Mrs?           Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she s not           crying.                            RALPH (CONT D)            I, uh, brought you a tea.           He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.                            PAMELA            It s blasphemy to drink tea from a            paper cup.           Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He s not quite           sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.           Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits           and pieces of twig and bloom that she s plucking from the           area around her.                            RALPH            Everything okay Ma am? Would you            like me to drive you home?                            PAMELA            All the way to England? Yes,            please.           Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.                            RALPH            You got family back there Mrs?                            PAMELA            You re an impertinent man you know?            You ask an awful lot of questions            that have no relevance to you being            able to carry out your duties.                            RALPH                            (LAUGHING)            I know! I do, do that. Yes!                            PAMELA            And you have no barometer.           Ralph is confused.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            Let us say that I haven t family            who d notice whether I was halfway            across the world or sitting in my            living room.           She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs           together.                            RALPH                            MA AM; I--           Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he           looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a           small line through the grass then hands it to him.                            PAMELA            Make a little furrow, there.           Ralph dutifully does as he s told, looking over his shoulder           for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.           Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.                            RALPH            I gotta kid.                            PAMELA            Well, most people do.                            RALPH            Jane-- she s got all kinds of            troubles.           Pamela raises an eyebrow.                            RALPH (CONT D)            Handicapped you know? Myelitis--             transverse.                            (BEAT)            She s in a wheelchair see? That s            why I concern myself with the            weather-- sunny day she can sit out            in the garden. Rainy day I have to            leave her cooped up inside.                            (BEAT)            Worry `bout the future, but then I            stop cuz you can t do that. Only            today.           Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes           holes in it.                            PAMELA            Now look.           She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes           and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of           Pamela s tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig           struts forming a roof.                            PAMELA (CONT D)            It s a band stand.           She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid           into Ralph s trench, which runs all the way around the park.                            RALPH            A river!                            PAMELA                            (CORRECTING HIM)            Lake.                            RALPH            Lake.                            (BEAT)            Hey! I wish I could take her there!           He points at the miniature park.                            PAMELA            Wouldn t that be nice?            INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA S BEDROOM - NIGHT            Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem           to her chest.           The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows           looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she           seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There s           just nothing there--                            MARGARET                            (WHISPERING)            I know you gave it to him.            (squeezing Ginty s hand)            All the hope is in the bottom of            that bottle, Helen.                            GINTY            Mother?                            MARGARET            I want you to take care of the            children.           Ginty is groggy, she doesn t understand.                            MARGARET (CONT D)            Watch over them.           Ginty sits up.                            MARGARET (CONT D)            I know you love your father more.            But one day you ll understand.                            GINTY            What?           Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed           following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is           crying.                                       EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT            Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in           her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden           like some ethereal ghost.                            GINTY            Mother!           She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.             BIDDY (O.S.)            Ginty!           Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her           mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.                            GINTY                            (CALLING)            Mother! Mother!           The baby is screaming now.                                       INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA S BEDROOM - NIGHT            Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in           it, she scoops Moya up from the crib.                            BIDDY            Where s ma?                            GINTY            Once upon a time there were three            little girls alone in a house.            They were frightened of the big            wide world just outside the door.           She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily           outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar           and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.                            GINTY (CONT D)            They were so afraid.           She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting           her mother to be standing there any minute but there is           nothing.                                       EXT. CREEK - NIGHT            The mud-stained hem of Margaret s nightdress sweeps along the           ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of           the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her           ankles, soaking the nightgown.             GINTY (V.O.)            But the stars were guarding them,            they glittered as they spoke  We            shall send a guide to show them the            way to the magical ladder which            will bring them all the way up to                            SEE US                                        EXT. LIVING ROOM - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT            Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front           of the fireplace.                            GINTY            And who do you think those            sparkling messengers sent? Who was            it that came flying through the            starry, starry sky to carry us up            to see them?           Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy s arms.                            BIDDY            An elf?                                       EXT. PORCH - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT            Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to           the girls through the window.                            GINTY            Their old Uncle Albert of course!            (beat, to Biddy)            Stay right here, be good--           Ginty climbs atop the horse.                            BIDDY            Are you going to the sky?                            GINTY            I m going to find the end of the            story so I can bring it back for            you!                            BIDDY            Is it happy?                                       EXT. PADDOCK - NIGHT            Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her           mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp           still burns on the porch.                                       EXT. CREEK - NIGHT            Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the           creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the           water. She wants to sink down and simply float away.           From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret           turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.           Margaret begins to weep.           Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,           wading into the water to grab hold of her.           Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep           water.

SUITE - EVENING            Pamela looks through a stack of books intently, jotting           something down on a piece Beverly Hills Hotel stationery           every now and then.           Presently, the phone rings. Pamela almost jumps out of her           skin. She rushes to grab it.                            PAMELA                            (INTO PHONE)            Mrs Travers!

PAMELA            Disappointments are to the soul            what the thunderstorm is to the            air.           Walt slams the phone down.

REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY            Dick, Bob and Don are drained. They stare at each other in           silence. Just the look tells us how much this all means to           them. It s desperate. Walt flings the door to the room open.                            WALT            Okay boys. We gotta fix this.                                       INT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING            Ginty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in           his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge.           The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence.             MARGARET (O.S.)            Oh my!           And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell.             AUNT ELLIE (O.S.)            Margaret, my poor child. I simply            had to come. We must fix this.           Travers eyes spring wide open in horror.

An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries -           plonked on the living room table and there beside it,           upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair           scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket -           a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same.           Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an           endless supply of belongings from her bag.                            ELLIE            Now, I ve brought every new fangled            treatment available in Sydney.           Biddy is open mouthed.

Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance           as item after item emerges from the carpetbag.

Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of           her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour           and excitement.                            PAMELA            Is it all like this?           Pamela pops a headache pill.                            WALT            Yup! Isn t it wonderful?           Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much           Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.

Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates           and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG           WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt.                            YOUNG WOMAN            I love you so much! Can I--?           She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a           signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and           hands it to the woman.

(gesturing to Pamela)            This woman s a bona fide genius!           The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts. she           realizes she s getting nothing and, clutching her precious           postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part           like the red sea for Walt and his guest.                                       EXT. MAIN STREET - DISNEYLAND - CONTINUOUS            Walt and Pamela make their way down Main Street. Walt stops           anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out           postcards to anyone who gets near.                            WALT            In Adventureland there is a tree--            this is a fun fact. A titbit.                            PAMELA            Tidbit.

WALT            And they said only God could make a            tree!           Pamela rolls her eyes.           There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed           by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just           background colour.           They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window.           It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices           the look but doesn t say anything.                            WALT (CONT D)            Where did she come from?

PAMELA            She flew in through the window one            day.                            WALT            Through the window huh?           Pamela nods curtly.                            WALT (CONT D)            It s just that easy isn t it Mrs            Travers?           He sees right through her.                            WALT (CONT D)            I know you don t wanna be here so            I m gonna take you to one ride-- my            favourite amusement and then I ll            set you free.

WALT            No greater joy than that seen            through the eyes of a child.           Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.                            WALT (CONT D)            There s a child in us all.                            PAMELA            Maybe in you Mister Disney, but            certainly not I.                            WALT            Get on the horse Pamela!           Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.                            WALT (CONT D)            When we first met, you said to me            `they re family.                             PAMELA            I said what?

WALT            No. I brought you all the way out            here for monetary gain. Had a wager            with the boys that I couldn t get            you on a ride. I win!           He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride           controller and off they go!           Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she           sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney           spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to           surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if           shooting for the stars.

TRAVER S BEDROOM - ALLORA - DAY            Travers has a violent coughing fit, he looks to his hand,           disturbed to see blood there. He grimaces at Ellie who has           her back to him as she folds clothes, a look of deep           satisfaction on her face.                            ELLIE            Well begun, is half done!           His face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon Ginty, outside           the window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an           unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close           with tiredness.            INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY            All the tables have been pushed to the walls, Don is just           pushing the last one away as Pamela comes in, followed by           Dolly with the tray carrying Pamela s tea.                            DON            Good morning Mrs Travers!           She looks at the new arrangement of the room.                            PAMELA            What horrors have you in store for            my beautiful characters today, hm?

He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He           hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to           their knees so that they are half the height of Bob.           Pamela raises an eyebrow.

RALPH (CONT D)                            (TO WALT)            Excuse me.           Ralph moves past Walt and gently taps Pamela on the shoulder,           she opens her eyes, relieved to see him.                            RALPH (CONT D)            You ready to go Mrs?                            PAMELA            Yes. Thank you.

To have            put everyone to so much trouble.                            WALT            You must reconsider. You must.                            PAMELA            I simply can t give her up. Not            yet. Perhaps not ever. I don t know                            WHY                            DISNEY            You do know why!

She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her           but Ralph blocks it.                            RALPH            The lady s ready to go now sir.           Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.                            WALT            He s?           Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and           confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela s bench and wraps his           arms around himself and looks to the sky.                                       EXT. LAX - DAY            Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for           Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and           opens the trunk of the car.                            RALPH            It s been a pleasure driving you            Mrs.                            PAMELA            No one likes a fibber.

PAMELA            You found out?

PAMELA            You re the only American I have            ever liked, Ralph.           Ralph is chuffed to bits.                            RALPH            May I ask why?

DISNEY - OUTER OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON            Tommie and Dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and           broken Walt Disney appears in front of them.                            WALT            She s gone?           Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt           apologetically.                            TOMMIE            Flight left 10 minutes ago.           Tommie hands him the itinerary, he glares at it.

She s all            hoity toity. British this and            British that and she s really an            Aussie called Helen Goff. Stuck up--                            WALT            Then who s Travers?           Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug.                            WALT (CONT D)            (smiles to himself)            I ve been talking to the wrong            person.                                       EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY            Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She           ruffles Andrew s fur before entering the house.            INT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY            Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and           emotional voices in the hall. She pokes her head into the           hallway. There, huddled together, whispering are her mother,           the doctor and Aunt Ellie.           Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.           Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of           her heart.           Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.           There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen,           shattered. She comes down to Ginty s level.                            MARGARET                            DADDY--           Ginty cannot react.           Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown           paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor.           Ginty s eyes fix on Aunt Ellie s umbrella on the back of the           chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.                            GINTY            I want to see my father.                            MARGARET            No, you mustn t.                            GINTY            I want to see him!           Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing,           biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.                            AUNT ELLIE            Let her go Margaret.           Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father s           bedroom.                                       INT. TRAVERS  BEDROOM - DAY            Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. She           stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step           by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The           sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted           with blood. The front of her father s nightdress is also           bloodstained. Ginty s eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes           open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither           peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.                            GINTY            I dropped the pears.           She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand.                            GINTY (CONT D)            I m sorry daddy.           Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without           turning around.                            GINTY (CONT D)            You promised you would fix            everything.                                       EXT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY            A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs           out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out           too.                                       INT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY            Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase.                            PAMELA            Hello house.                                       INT. PAMELA S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in           darkness. She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and           a lifetime s despair.           There s a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn t           know how long she s been asleep but it s black outside. She           gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will           take her.           She swings it open.                            PAMELA            Oh dear god!           Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite           literally, speechless.                            WALT            It was one heck of a job getting a            seat on the very next flight, let            me tell you.                            PAMELA            But, you always get what you want            eventually. Isn t that right            Walter?           He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.                            WALT            How about you show me how to make            one of those nice English pots of            tea?                                       INT. PAMELA S DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT            Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a           teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he           places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.                            PAMELA            Milk. The milk goes in first.           He attends to it.                            WALT            I remember.                            PAMELA            And whiskey. I ll have whiskey in            mine.           Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes           it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.                            WALT                            (SURPRISED)            Oh.

To            beat me into submission.                            WALT            No, I ve come because you misjudge            me.

I open the door to Mary Poppins            and who should be standing there            but Walt Disney!           He laughs.                            WALT            Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped            this would be a magical experience            for you, for all of us. But I let            you down-- and in doing so, I ve            broken a twenty year old promise to            my girls.

WALT            But it is true that you created            yourself in someone else s yes?           She doesn t answer.

PAMELA            Can t say I do and as I have no            plans to ever set foot on American            soil again I m afraid I never will.                            WALT            It s mighty cold there in the            winters. Bitter.           Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then           gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he s           suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.                            WALT (CONT D)            (it pours out)            My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a            newspaper delivery route there.            Thousand papers. Twice daily.            Morning and evening edition. Elias,            he was a tough businessman. A save-            a-penny anywhere you can type of            fella so he wouldn t employ any            delivery boys, he just used me and            my big brother Roy.

Then            school, too cold to figure out an            equation.

The unsigned rights papers in front of her           on the table. She looks at Mickey who occupies the chair           opposite her, her face softens under his gaze.

Pamela begins to tap again.             POLLY (O.S.)            Mrs Travers!           Pamela tuts, tries to carry on with her work.             POLLY (O.S.)

She sneezes twice,           doesn t bother to pour and turns to leave.

Just a few            announcements before we begin our            taxi for takeoff--           Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at           the tarmac.           She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes           again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands           neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.                                       INT.

SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY            The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn t even bother           hovering for a tip.           Pamela turns and it s like deju vu - the flowers, the           chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere           of Walt Disney s Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous           stuffed Mickey Mouse.

The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo           pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn t dare get her hopes up           but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person           in America.

Reporters           stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their           hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens           play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream           every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and           posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces           up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing           for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is           completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest           party you could ever go to.                                       INT.

Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with           them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.                                       EXT. GRAUMAN S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT            The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.           He rushes round to Pamela s side and helps her from the car.           Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm           up to shield her eyes. It s too much.                            RALPH            (in her ear)            This is your night. None of this            would be possible without you.           She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks           into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic           whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of:  Who is           that?   Is that anyone?  Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and           Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.           Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and           Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved           hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy           train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds           of coloured balloons fly out of it s roof and into the air.                                       EXT. GRAUMAN S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT            Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect           toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.                                       INT. GRAUMAN S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT            The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of           Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the           same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin           to dim. The overture begins--           We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade           and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers           old melody s rings in her ears.           We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain           with Pamela.           She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,           humming, sad, happy, joyous.           Intercut with images from Pamela s childhood and the voices           of Bert and Jane -           Ellie s parrot head umbrella--                            BERT            You know, begging your pardon, but            the one my heart goes out to is            your father.           The carousel horses at the Allora fair--                            BERT (CONT D)            There he is in that cold, heartless            bank day after day, hemmed in by            mounds of cold, heartless            money.           The tuppence and rolling pears--                            BERT (CONT D)            I don t like to see any living            thing caged up.           Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river           soaked mother back to the house--                            JANE            Father in a cage?           Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father s hand--                            BERT            They makes cages in all sizes and            shapes, you know.           The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--                            BERT (CONT D)            Bank-shaped some of  em, carpets            and all.                            DISSOLVE TO:           Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.           Rapt.                            MICHEAL            You won t ever leave us will you?                            JANE            Whatever would we do without you?                            MARY POPPINS            I shall stay until the wind            changes.           And then an image from the film:           George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined           London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.           Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.           Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her           shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud           but people are noticing, looking at her.           Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She           reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.                            WALT            It s all right, Mrs Travers. It s            alright. Mr Banks is going to be            all right. I promise.           Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It s           all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.                            PAMELA            No, no. It s just that-- I can t, I            can t abide cartoons!           We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the           film: Let s Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are           smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent           now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to           mouth along with the lyrics.           And in her head one final image appears.           Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,           sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken           understanding of what is to come, before his close with           tiredness.             TRAVERS (V.O.)            Never. I promise. I will never lose            you.                            DISSOLVE TO:                                       EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY            The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty           sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her           chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her           face.

SUMMER COTTAGE -- DAY   A young family together in bed.  It is a bright summer  morning.  Father, mother, and a three year old girl are  still asleep.  They are naked.  A light breeze drifts into  the room.  The scene is serene and softly suspended.   Head credits appear over this idyllic image.  The little  girl turns in her sleep.  A dog barks outside.           CUT TO   INT./EXT.  CAR WASH. -- NIGHT   From the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene  shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash.  The image is shot  through the windshield, from the driver s point of view.   The car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels  and gushing water.           CUT TO   INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT   Inside the car MITCHELL STEPHENS, a man in his mid-fifties,  listens to a stirring piece of music.  The sound of the car  wash is filtered out by the strains of music.           CUT TO   EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT   The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large  city.  A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the  receiver.           CUT TO   INT.

MITCHELL   The problem is I have no idea who   I m talking to right now.      ZOE     (over the phone)    Cause you think I m stoned, Daddy?    Cause you think I ve got a needle   stuck in my arm?

The music that MITCHELL has been listening to becomes louder  as he stares at the spinning felt wheels of the car wash.      ZOE (CONT D)   DADDY!!!      MITCHELL   Yes.             ZOE   Why can t you talk to me?      MITCHELL   I...I just need to know what state   you re in so I know...how to talk to   you...how to act...   MITCHELL is in pain.  He closes his eyes.           CUT TO   INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT   The phone booth is deserted.  ZOE is nowhere to be seen.   Over this image, the sounds of a band playing a blues  number.           CUT TO   EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY   The blues number continues as the camera cranes down to the  bandstand of a country fair.  A local band is rehearsing.   Around the practising band, various carpenters and  technicians are making final preparations for that evening s  big event.   One of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in  his early forties.  He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she  sings into the microphone.  NICOLE is sixteen.   NICOLE stares at her father as she sings.   ANGLE ON   SAM looking back at his daughter.  He is intensely proud of  her.  SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.  He  gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the  grandstand.          CUT TO   INT. AIRPORT. WASHROOM -- AFTERNOON   CLOSE UP of a three year old girl, staring up into the lens.  Her face is full of sweetness and trust.   ANGLE ON          MITCHELL STEPHENS in a crowded airport washroom, watching a  young father, PETER, trying to change the diaper on his  three year old daughter.   MITCHELL stares at the little girl, his face registering a  wistful smile.  PETER is having a hard time trying to find  the towel from the toddler s bag and keeping an eye on her  at the same time.      MITCHELL   Need a hand?      PETER   Sure, it you could find a towel in   this bag.  I know my wife packed one   in there...   MITCHELL comes forward and searches through the toddler s  bag.      MITCHELL   You always think you re prepared for   these things.      PETER   Tell me about it.      MITCHELL   How old is she?      PETER   Almost three.      MITCHELL     (finding a towel)   Is this it?      PETER   Perfect.      MITCHELL   Here we go.      PETER   Thanks.   PETER lays the towel across the counter, and dries the  little girl.  MITCHELL watches as PETER puts a new diaper on  her.  The toddler stares up at MITCHELL, her eyes are  playful.   MITCHELL stares at the girl s face.           CUT TO           INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT   TIME CUT back to MITCHELL honking the horn of his car,  trying to get someone s attention.  No response.  MITCHELL  picks up his cell phone, and dials the operator.      MITCHELL   Yes, operator, I m in a strange   situation.  I m calling from my car,   and I appear to be stuck in a car   wash...A car wash, yes...Is there   anyway you   could...Hello?...Hello?...   The line has died.   MITCHELL searches for an umbrella, finds one, and tries to  get out of the car without getting soaked.   ANGLE ON   MITCHELL as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself  from the onslaught of water with his umbrella.  He is  immediately soaked by a large mop.  The camera watches  MITCHELL as he makes his way towards light at the end of the  wash.           CUT TO   INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT   MITCHELL walks into the office of the car wash.  No one is  there.  There is an ominous buzz coming from another room.   MITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto  repair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of  discarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an  electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge  of screeching feedback.   Someone was just here.  They are nowhere to be seen.      MITCHELL   Hello?   No response.  MITCHELL picks up the guitar, which begins to  produce a terrifying electronic feedback.          CUT TO   EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY          SAM and NICOLE wander through the fairground.  Various rides  and concession stands are being set up.  SAM has his arm  around NICOLE.      SAM   That was great.      NICOLE   Really?      SAM   You re going to blow everyone away.      NICOLE   You mean it?      SAM   Of course.      NICOLE   You don t sound like one hundred   percent absolutely sure.      SAM   I am.  Really.  It was awesome.   NICOLE assesses SAM.  Sensing his sincerity, she throws her  arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement.      NICOLE   I m so happy, Daddy.           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK   MITCHELL STEPHEN S car pulls into the parking lot of this  run-down roadside motel.  In the fading light, a magnificent  mountain range is seen in the background.           CUT TO   INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING   MITCHELL enters the reception area, and rings a bell on the  desk.  After a few moments RISA WALKER appears.  She is an  exhausted looking woman in her mid-thirties, once attractive  but very run-down.  RISA stares at MITCHELL S soaked  clothes.      MITCHELL   Hello.      RISA           Is it raining outside?      MITCHELL   No, I...had an accident.   Pause.  RISA stares at MITCHELL, her expression somewhere  else.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   Do you have a room?      RISA   Will you be spending more than a   night?      MITCHELL   Hard to say.  I might have...some   business here.   A voice is heard from the darkness beyond the desk.      WENDELL   Are you a reporter?      MITCHELL   No.   WENDELL WALKER, RISA S husband, appears from the darkness.      WENDELL   You here about the accident?   MITCHELL stares at WENDELL S haunted eyes, then looks back  at RISA.  He immediately knows their story.      MITCHELL   Yes.  I m a lawyer.  I realize this   is an awful time, but it s important   that we talk.           CUT TO   EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY   A group of men are setting up the ferris wheel for the  country fair.  SAM and NICOLE walk into the shot, eating ice  cream cones.  SAM waves at someone he recognizes in the  distance.      SAM   Let s sit down.   NICOLE nods, her mind elsewhere.                  CUT TO   EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY   SAM and NICOLE are sitting at an outside table, finishing  their cones.   A school bus pulls up into the fairground.  NICOLE watches  as young children spill out of the bus and gather outside.   NICOLE smiles at this scene.  SAM notices, turns around to  see the children, then turns back to NICOLE.      SAM   What s so funny?      NICOLE   Just the way Dolores gets so excited   about bringing the kids to check out   the animals.  It s like the biggest   thing in her life.   ANGLE ON   DOLORES DRISCOLL, a warm and cheery woman in her forties,  leading the young children into the large exhibition barn on  the fair site.      DOLORES   Alright, kids.  I want you all to   listen to me.  Rule number one  No   one is allowed to stick their   fingers into the cages.  I don t   care how cute some of these animals   may be, the fact is they don t like   being here, no matter how many   ribbons some of them have won...           CUT TO   INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING   MITCHELL STEPHENS is having a meeting with WENDELL and RISA  WALKER in their livingroom behind the reception area.  MITCHELL has a pad of paper and is taking notes.      WENDELL   Kyle Lambston s a drunk.  Nobody   likes him.  He s a nasty piece of   work.      MITCHELL   In what way?             WENDELL   Been drinking since high school.   Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart   enough.      MITCHELL   Any criminal record?      WENDELL   Probably half a dozen traffic   convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost   his licence.  That s why he don t   work no more.      WENDELL   Can t get off that shitty dump they   live on.  What little money comes in   goes to booze.      MITCHELL   How does the family survive?      WENDELL   Don t know.  Food banks, welfare,   church charity.  They scrape by.   MITCHELL looks at RISA, who has remained silent.      MITCHELL   What about Doreen?      RISA   She...she was a friend of mine.      MITCHELL   When?      RISA   At school.  She fell for Kyle just   before we graduated.  Got pregnant,   and...went to live in a trailer up   on a woodlot Kyle s dad used to own.   Kyle started spending more and more   time at the Spread Eagle...      MITCHELL   That s the local bar?      RISA     (nodding)   ...coming home drunk and I guess   feeling trapped by his life and   blaming her for that...and...          RISA hesitates.      WENDELL   Taking it out on her.   MITCHELL stops taking notes, and looks at the WALKERS.      MITCHELL   He beat her?   RISA nods.  MITCHELL crosses the LAMBSTONS off of his list.  He looks up at RISA and WENDELL.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   You see, to do this right, to   actually have a chance at winning -   of getting some money to compensate   you for the loss of your boy - we   need folks like you.  Sensitive,   loving parents.  People with no   criminal background or history of   trouble in town.  Do you understand?   The WALKERS nod.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   Now, of all these parents you ve   told me about whose kids were   killed, who would you consider to be   good upstanding neighbors?   RISA stares hard at MITCHELL.      RISA   What do you mean?      MITCHELL   People who will help our cause.   Pause.      RISA   Well, there s the Hamiltons.  Joe   and Shelly Hamilton.      WENDELL     (caustically)   Yeah, right.   Beat.  MITCHELL looks at WENDELL, waiting for an  explanation.      WENDELL (CONT D)           I mean, everyone knows Joey steals   antiques from summer cottages.   Resells them to dealers in the city.   He s been doing that for years.   MITCHELL regards WENDELL with a slight smile of admiration.      MITCHELL   That s great, Wendell.  That s the   sort of thing I need to know.  So it   doesn t come back to haunt our case   later on.      RISA   There s the Prescots...      WENDELL   That sonofabitch owes thousands to   the bank and half the businesses in   town.  He s about to lose his house   and car.      RISA   But Charlene...      WENDELL   Charlene s over at the Spread Eagle   every other night.  Sleeps with   whatever she can get her hands on.   She ll go down for a pat on the head   and a fistful of peanuts.   MITCHELL is taking notes.      WENDELL (CONT D)   Don t even think of the Bilodeaus or   the Atwaters.  They re all inbred.      RISA   The Ottos.   Pause.  MITCHELL waits.  No response from WENDELL.      MITCHELL   Tell me about the Ottos.      RISA   Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear.   He was their adopted son.  A   beautiful boy.  Indian.      MITCHELL   Indian?             RISA   Yes.      MITCHELL   That s good.  Judges like adopted   Indian boys.  Tell me more about the   Ottos.   As RISA talks, MITCHELL takes notes.      RISA   They re smart.  Been to college.   They moved here from the city about   a dozen years ago.      MITCHELL   What do they do?      RISA   Crafts.      MITCHELL   Crafts?      RISA   Wanda does these photographic   things.  That s one of her pictures   on the wall.      WENDELL   Yeah, well, they probably smoke   weed.      RISA   You don t know that.      MITCHELL   Have they ever been busted?      RISA   No.      WENDELL   You don t know is what you mean.   MITCHELL regards the tension between RISA and WENDELL as he  continues to make notes.   MITCHELL S cell phone rings.  He answers it.      MITCHELL   Yes, I ll accept the charges.   MITCHELL stands up.              MITCHELL (CONT D)   Do you mind if I step outside for a   moment?  It s a private call.   The WALKERS nod as MITCHELL moves outside.           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK   MITCHELL speaks into his cellular phone.      MITCHELL   Zoe...Zoe, where are you?           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY   A newscaster is giving a report on the television screen of  a first class airplane cabin.  The image is silent.   This scene takes place two years after the accident.   MITCHELL STEPHENS is playing with his headset, which doesn t  seem to be working.  He summons a STEWARDESS over.      MITCHELL   I m not getting any sound.   The STEWARDESS checks the headset and confirms the problem.      STEWARDESS   I ll find you another pair.   The STEWARDESS leaves.   A young woman seated beside MITCHELL hands him her headset.      ALISON   You can have mine.   MITCHELL takes ALISON S headset.  Their eyes lock for a  moment.      ALISON (CONT D)   Yes, we do know each other.  I m   Alison Jones.      MITCHELL   Alison Jones.      ALISON           I was a friend of Zoe s.  We went to   school together.  I used to come to   your house.      MITCHELL     (pretending to     remember)   Yes.      ALISON   Ally.  That was my nickname.      MITCHELL   Ally.  That s right.      ALISON   How are you?      MITCHELL   I m just fine, Ally.  What about   you?      ALISON   I m fine.  Still working with my   father.      MITCHELL   And what does he do again?      ALISON   He used to work with you.  Until you   found out he was having an affair   with your wife.   Pause.  MITCHELL finally remembers ALISON JONES.      MITCHELL   Ally Jones.      ALISON   How is Mrs. Stephens?      MITCHELL   We re...not together.      ALISON   I d heard that.  But she s well?      MITCHELL   Yes...fine.      ALISON   And Zoe?  How s Zoe?          Pause.  The STEWARDESS comes back with a new headset.  She  notices the set that ALISON has given him.      STEWARDESS   Oh, you ve beaten me to it.   The STEWARDESS hands the headset to ALISON.      STEWARDESS (CONT D)   Here.   The camera has remained fixed on MITCHELL S face.           CUT TO   EXT. ROADSIDE -- MORNING   WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO are waiting for the school bus with  their adopted son BEAR.   The bus arrives, and the door opens to reveal DOLORES  DRISCOLL, who is driving.      DOLORES   Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.      WANDA   Hi, Dolores.   DOLORES watches as WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO affectionately say  goodbye to their boy.  WANDA gives BEAR a photograph, which  has strong psychedelic influences.  BEAR shows it proudly to  DOLORES.      WANDA (CONT D)   What do you think?      DOLORES   Well, it s certainly what you d call   interesting.      WANDA     (laughing)   You hate it.      DOLORES   I didn t say that.      WANDA   I could wrap it up.  Protect the   other kids.      DOLORES   I ll just strap it on the roof.              WANDA   It s for the school bazaar.      DOLORES   Oh, it s bizarre alright.  C mon   Bear.  Let s get you out of here.      WANDA   Away from your crazy Mom.      DOLORES     (voice over)   The Ottos always waited for the bus   with Bear.  They were the only   parents who did that, together like   that.  I guess they re what you   might call hippies.      MITCHELL     (voice over)   What do you mean by that, Mrs.   Driscoll?           CUT TO   INT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   DOLORES and MITCHELL are in the modest livingroom of  DOLORES S house.  The conversation continues from the  previous voice over.   In the corner of the room sits ABBOTT, DOLORES S husband.  ABBOTT has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be  completely paralyzed.  His presence, however, is intense and  powerful.   MITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his  conversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him  like a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy.      DOLORES   Dolores.  No one calls me  Mrs.   Driscoll .      MITCHELL   What do you mean by that, Dolores?      DOLORES   About the Ottos?      MITCHELL   Yes.  What do you mean by  hippies ?             DOLORES   I mean, the way they look.  Their   hair and clothing...      MITCHELL   Do they have any reputation for   drugs?      DOLORES   No, nothing like that.  The Ottos   are what I d call model citizens.   They re regular at town meetings.   They give their opinions  in a   respectful way.  They always help   out at various fund-raising bazaars   in town , though they aren t church   goers.      MITCHELL   And they loved Bear.      DOLORES   Oh yes.  Like I said, they always   came out together to see him off to   school.  It s like he was their   little treasure.  He was such a   beautiful boy.  That s a picture of   him on the wall there, behind   Abbott.   MITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR.   It is right behind ABBOTT S head, so MITCHELL has to divide  his attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching  a prize rabbit at last year s county fair, and ABBOTT S  glaring eyes.   ANGLE ON   The PHOTOGRAPHS of various children with their pets.  Some  have ribbons.      DOLORES (CONT D)     (voice over)   Those are all from the fair last   year.  Abbott and me were judges at   the pet show.      MITCHELL   For rabbits?      DOLORES     (nodding)           Abbott used to breed them  til he   had the stroke.  Bear won first   prize.  Just look at the smile on   his face.      DOLORES   He was one of those children that   bring out the best in people.  He   would have been a wonderful man.   ANGLE ON   MITCHELL as he stares at the photo of BEAR.           CUT TO   EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING   The camera is outside the bus, looking at BEAR as he  finishes waving to his parents.   ANGLE ON   BEAR S P.O.V. of WANDA and HARTLEY disappearing as the bus  pulls away.           CUT TO   INT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING   The camera moves inside the crowded bus, peering at the  childrens  activity as they play with each other in the bus.   ANGLE ON   JESSICA and MASON ANSEL are seated at the back of the bus,  looking out the rear window, waving at someone.           CUT TO   EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING   JESSICA and MASON are seen waving at...   BILLY ANSEL, driving behind them in his pick up truck.  He  waves back at his children.      DOLORES     (voice over)   Billy Ansel started honking at us up   around Upper Hat Creek.  He always   started to do that when he caught up   to the bus.  He d wave at his kids,   Jessica and Mason, who always sat at           the back.  Normally, he followed us   the whole distance over the ridge   towards the school.           CUT TO   INT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   The conversation between MITCHELL and DOLORES continues from  the previous scene.      MITCHELL   So Billy was driving behind the bus   at the time of the accident?   DOLORES nods.  Her expression is distant.      DOLORES   Billy loved to see his kids in the   bus.  They always sat in the back,   so they could wave to each other.   It comforted him.      MITCHELL   From what?      DOLORES     (confused)   From what?      MITCHELL   Did he have any particular problems   that you knew of?  Financial   pressures...run-ins with the law...      DOLORES   No, nothing like that.  Billy s   wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few   years ago.  He took over raising the   children by himself.  It was obvious   how much he missed Lydia.      MITCHELL   You talked about it?      DOLORES   No.     (beat)   I saw it on his face.   Pause.  DOLORES stares at MITCHELL.           CUT TO          EXT. BILLY S PICK-UP -- MORNING   Through the windshield, the camera fixes on BILLY S face as  he stares at his children.   ANGLE ON   Inside the cab of his pick up, BILLY dials a number on his  cell phone.  He continues to wave at his children as he  speaks into the phone.      BILLY     (into the phone)   Hi...Can you talk?  I m on my way to   work...I m waving at them   now...What s that noise?           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING   RISA is on a cordless phone.  She has just finished cleaning  a room.  WENDELL is hammering in the background.      RISA   Wendell s working on the roof.  He   thinks he s fixing a leak.  As far   as I m concerned he s just punching   in a few new holes.           CUT TO   INT. BILLY S PICK-UP -- MORNING   BILLY smiles as he continues the conversation.      BILLY   Nicole s coming over to look after   the kids tonight.  She ll be there   around six.      RISA   Billy, that s too early.      BILLY   She said she s got to be home by   nine.      RISA   Can t you make it later?      BILLY           Look, I ll be waiting in the room.   You get over as soon as you can.   Okay?      RISA   I guess.           CUT TO   EXT. ROAD. -- MORNING   HELICOPTER AERIAL SHOT   The bus and the pick-up are travelling through a beautiful  mountain pass.           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY   MITCHELL continues his conversation with ALISON as they eat  dinner.      ALISON   I m glad to hear that Zoe s okay.      MITCHELL   Are you still in touch?      ALISON   Not really.  The last time I saw her   was at that clinic.  That was a long   time ago.      MITCHELL   Which one?      ALISON   Which one?      MITCHELL   Which clinic?      ALISON   I don t remember the name.  It was   near a beach.      MITCHELL   Sunnyridge.  That was a long time    ago.   Beat.  ALISON proceeds cautiously.             ALISON   So there were others?      MITCHELL     (as he eats)   Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics,   half-way houses, treatment centers,   detox units...      ALISON   Then...when did she get better?      MITCHELL   She didn t.      ALISON   But you said...      MITCHELL   That s where I m going.  To see her.      ALISON   She s in trouble?      MITCHELL   Yes.     (beat)   Do you find there s something   strange about this meat?   ALISON stares at her plate.  MITCHELL summons the  STEWARDESS.      STEWARDESS   Some more wine?      MITCHELL   I m afraid this meat is overdone.      STEWARDESS   I m sorry about that, Mr. Stephens.   Would you like to try the fish?      MITCHELL   What is it?      STEWARDESS   Poached salmon.   MITCHELL considers this.  He is polite, but slightly edgy.      MITCHELL   Do you have a cold plate?             STEWARDESS   We do.      MITCHELL   Is there shrimp on it?      STEWARDESS   Yes.      MITCHELL   If you could pick the shrimp off, as   well as anything that touches the   shrimp...      STEWARDESS     (smiling)   I m not sure if that will leave much   on the plate.      MITCHELL   Well, let s see what we get.   The STEWARDESS leaves with MITCHELL S food.  MITCHELL gets  up.      MITCHELL (CONT D)     (to ALISON)   If you could excuse me for a moment.   ALISON nods.  MITCHELL leaves.  ALISON picks at her meat  undecidedly.           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY   In the mirror of the tiny washroom of the plane, MITCHELL  washes some water on his face.  He stares at his reflection  in the mirror.          CUT TO   EXT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY   MITCHELL approaches the house of HARTLEY and WANDA OTTO.  He  gets out of his car and knocks on the door.   WANDA OTTO answers.  She has been crying.  The two stare at  each other.      MITCHELL   Mrs. Otto, my name is Mitchell   Stephens.  The Walkers told me you   might be willing to talk to me.           Pause.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   I m sorry for coming over   unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto,   but the Walkers said you would   understand.  I know it s an awful   time, but it s important that we   talk.      WANDA   Who are you?      MITCHELL   I m a lawyer.      WANDA   You can t come here.      MITCHELL   Please, let me explain.  I ll only   take a moment of your time.      WANDA   No.      MITCHELL   Please.   WANDA pauses, stares at MITCHELL, then lets him in.           CUT TO   INT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY   MITCHELL walks into the OTTO residence.  It is a large two-  storey space divided into several smaller chambers with  sheets of brightly colored cloth - tie-dyes and Indian  madras - that hang from wires.   On a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is  a large wood-burning stove.  A few feet from the stove,  sitting on an overstuffed cushion, is HARTLEY OTTO.   HARTLEY is listening to music on his headphones.  He is very  stoned.  WANDA moves over, and pulls the headphones off her  husband s head.      WANDA   We have a guest.  What did you say   your name was?      MITCHELL           Mitchell Stephens.   MITCHELL hands them a card.  HARTLEY reads it with  deliberation.      WANDA   The Walkers sent him by.   HARTLEY rises up.  He stares at MITCHELL.  A tense pause.      HARTLEY   You want a cup of tea or something?      MITCHELL   A cup of tea would be nice.     (beat)   Would it be alright if I sit down   for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I   want to talk to you.   WANDA stares at MITCHELL.  No response.  MITCHELL waits a  beat, then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large  pillow.  He is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold  them under his chin.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   The Walkers spoke very highly of   you.      WANDA   You ve been retained?      MITCHELL   Yes.      WANDA   Their child died, and they got a   lawyer.   Pause.  MITCHELL assesses WANDA S energy.      MITCHELL   It should be said that my task is to   represent the Walkers only in their   anger.  Not their grief.      WANDA   Who did they get for that?      MITCHELL   You are angry, aren t you, Mrs.   Otto?  That s why I m here.  To give   your anger a voice.  To be your           weapon against whoever caused that   bus to go off the road.      WANDA   Dolores?      MITCHELL   It s my belief that Dolores was   doing exactly what she d been doing   for years.  Besides, the school   board s insurance on Dolores is   minimal.  A few million at the very   most.  The really deep pockets are   to be found in the town, or in the   company that made the bus.      WANDA   You think someone else caused the   accident?      MITCHELL   Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing   as an accident.  The word doesn t   mean anything to me.  As far as I m   concerned, somebody somewhere made a   decision to cut a corner.  Some   corrupt agency or corporation   accounted the cost variance between   a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar   out-of-court settlement.  They   decided to sacrifice a few lives for   the difference.  That s what s done,   Mrs. Otto.  I ve seen it happen so   many times before.   HARTLEY returns with the tea.      HARTLEY   But Dolores said she saw a dog and   tried to...      MITCHELL   How long has Dolores been driving   that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times   has she steered clear of danger?   What went wrong that morning?   MITCHELL takes the cup of tea.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   Someone calculated ahead of time   what it would cost to sacrifice   safety.  It s the darkest, most   cynical thing to imagine, but it s           absolutely true.  And now, it s up   to me to make them build that bus   with an extra bolt, or add an extra   yard of guard rail.  It s the only   way we can ensure moral   responsibility in this society.  By   what I do.   Pause.      WANDA   So you re just the thing we need.      MITCHELL   Excuse me?      WANDA   Isn t that what you want us to   believe?  That we re completely   defenseless?  That you know what s   best?      MITCHELL   Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very   carefully.  I do know what s best.    As we re sitting here the town or   the school board or the manufacturer   of that bus are lining up a battery   of their own lawyers to negotiate   with people as grief-stricken as   yourselves.  And this makes me very,   very mad.  It s why I came all the   way up here.  If everyone had done   their job with integrity your son   would be alive this morning and   safely in school.  I promise you   that I will pursue and reveal who it   was that did not do their job.      MITCHELL   Who is responsible for this tragedy.   Then, in your name and the Walkers    name and the name of whoever decides   to join us, I shall sue.  I shall   sue for negligence until they bleed.   Pause.      WANDA   I want that person to go to jail.   For the rest of his life.  I want   him to die there.  I don t want his   money.           MITCHELL nods sympathetically.      MITCHELL   It s unlikely that anyone will go to   prison, Mrs. Otto.  But he or his   company will pay in other ways.  And   we must make them pay.  Not for the    money or to compensate you for the   loss of your son.  That can t be   done.  But to protect other innocent   children.  You see, I m not just   here to speak for your anger, but   for the future as well.     (beat)   What we re talking about is an   ongoing relationship to time.   Pause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL S teacup.      HARTLEY   I didn t ask if you wanted milk.      MITCHELL   No.  A little sugar though.      HARTLEY   We ve only got honey.      MITCHELL   I ll...take it straight.   MITCHELL maintains his eye contact with WANDA.      WANDA   Are you expensive?      MITCHELL   No.      MITCHELL   If you agree to have me represent   you in this suit, I will require no   payment until after the case is won,   when I will require one third of the   awarded amount.  If there is no   award made, then my services will   cost you nothing.  It s a standard   agreement.      WANDA   Do you have this agreement with you?             MITCHELL   It s in my car.   MITCHELL gets up.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   I ll just be a minute.  Anyhow, you   should discuss this all without me   before you make any decision.   MITCHELL moves to the door.           CUT TO   EXT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY   MITCHELL leaves the house and moves to his car.  He gets  inside and closes the door.   Once inside, MITCHELL opens his briefcase and takes out an  agreement for the OTTOS.  Something inside the briefcase  catches his attention.   ANGLE ON   A photograph of ZOE.   MITCHELL stares at this photograph.      MITCHELL     (voice over)   I ve done everything the loving   father of a drug addict is supposed   to do...           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- EVENING   MITCHELL and ALISON have finished dinner.  MITCHELL is  drinking a triple scotch.      MITCHELL     (continuing from     voice over)   ...I ve sent her to the best   hospitals, she s seen all the best   doctors.  It doesn t matter.  Two   weeks later she s on the street.   New York, Vancouver, Pittsburgh,   Toronto, L.A.  The next time I hear   from her, it s a phone call scamming   for money.  Money for school, or   money for a new kind of therapist,           or money for a plane ticket home.    Oh Daddy, just let me come   home...Please, Daddy, I have to see   you...   But she never comes home.   I m always at the airport, but she s   never there.  Ten years of this, ten   years of these lies, of imagining   what happens if I don t send the   money, of  kicking down doors and   dragging her out of rat-infested   apartments, of explaining why that   couldn t be my daughter in a porn   flick someone saw...well, enough   rage and helplessness, and your love   turns to something else.      ALISON     (soft)   What...does it turn to?      MITCHELL   It turns to steaming piss.   Pause.  ALISON is shocked by MITCHELL S intensity.  He  collects himself.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   I m...so sorry.      ALISON   That s okay.           CUT TO   EXT. BILLY S HOUSE. -- LATE DAY   BILLY is chasing his kids around the yard of their house.  NICOLE appears, and watching BILLY play with JESSICA and  MASON.  BILLY notices her, and runs up breathlessly,      BILLY   Hi, Nicole.      NICOLE   Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica,   Mason...      BILLY   They just finished supper.      NICOLE     (to the kids)   Was it good?          The children shake their heads.  NICOLE and BILLY laugh.      BILLY   I ll be back around nine.      NICOLE   Okay.           CUT TO   INT. GAS STATION -- DUSK   BILLY is playing his electric guitar in the same garage that  MITCHELL walked into at the beginning of the film.   This is the gas station/repair shop/car wash that BILLY  runs.   BILLY checks his watch, and takes his guitar off.  He leaves  the garage.           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK   BILLY is walking along a path behind the hotel, making sure  that he is not seen.  He sneaks into Room 11.           CUT TO   INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING   BILLY is sitting in a chair in Room 11, smoking a cigarette.  The room is dark.  After a while, RISA enters through the  door and slips inside.      RISA   Have you been waiting long?      BILLY   A while.      RISA   Billy, do you have to smoke?   Wendell can smell if someone s been   smoking.   BILLY gets up to put out his cigarette in the toilet.  He  notices some work tools in the washroom.      BILLY   What s all this?      RISA           Wendell put some fresh enamel on   that break in the tub.      BILLY   Does this mean I can t take a   shower?      RISA   No.  It should be dry by now.   BILLY nods.  He turns around, looks at RISA, and begins to  unbutton her shirt.  RISA stops him, smiles, and kisses  BILLY.  After a moment, she pulls away, unbuckles her belt,  and slips off her jeans.  She moves to the bed.      BILLY   What time s he coming home?      RISA   When the game s over, I guess.   BILLY moves to the radio and turns it on, tuning into a  hockey game.  RISA laughs.  He lowers the volume.  RISA  takes off her shirt, and moves behind BILLY, kissing his  neck.  BILLY closes his eyes.           CUT TO   INT. BILLY S HOUSE. -- EVENING   JESSICA and MASON, BILLY S children, are being read to sleep  by NICOLE.  She reads from Robert Browning s THE PIED PIPER  OF HAMELIN.      NICOLE   The Pied Piper of Hamelin.   By famous Hanover city;   The river Weser, deep and wide,   Washes its wall on the southern   side;   A pleasanter spot you never spied;   But, when begins my ditty...      MASON   What s a ditty again?      NICOLE   It s like a song.      MASON   Oh.      NICOLE           When begins my ditty,   Almost five hundred years ago,   To see the townsfolk suffer so   From vermin, was a pity...      MASON   What s vermin again?      NICOLE   Rats!   They fought the dogs and killed the   cats,   And bit the babies in the cradles,   And ate the cheeses out of vats.   And licked the soup from the cook s   own ladles,   Split open the kegs of salted   sprats,   Made nests inside men s Sunday hats,   And even spoiled the women s chats,   By drowning their speaking   With shrieking and squeaking   In fifty different sharps and   flats...      MASON   Nicole?      NICOLE   Yes.      MASON   Can I sit beside you on the bus   tomorrow?      NICOLE   Don t you usually like to sit at the   back?  To wave at your Dad?      MASON   I want to sit beside you tomorrow.      NICOLE   Okay.   NICOLE covers JESSICA, and gets up to leave.      MASON   Nicole?      NICOLE   What, Mason?      MASON           Did the Pied Piper take the children   away because he was mad that the   town didn t pay him?      NICOLE   That s right.      MASON   Well, if he knew magic - if he could   get the kids into the mountain - why   couldn t he use his pipe to make the   people pay him for getting rid of   the rats?      NICOLE   Because...he wanted to them to be   punished.      MASON   The people in the town?      NICOLE   Yes.      MASON   So he was mean?      NICOLE   No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.      MASON   Oh.      NICOLE   Should I keep reading?      MASON   Okay.   NICOLE smiles at MASON.  JESSICA is already asleep.           CUT TO   INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING   Room 11 at the Bide-A-Wile.  RISA is naked, sitting cross-  legged on the bed.  BILLY has just gotten into the shower.  RISA stares at BILLY through the semi-transparent curtain.   RISA stands up and walks to the window.  She looks across  the parking lot.   ANGLE ON          RISA S P.O.V. of the rain-glistened concrete.           CUT TO   INT. BILLY S HOUSE. -- NIGHT   NICOLE is in BILLY S bedroom.  She has some womens  clothing  laid out on the bed, and is staring at the selection of  blouses and summer dresses.  The camera slowly glides to a  picture that BILLY has beside his bed.   ANGLE ON   The photograph.  It shows BILLY and his deceased wife,  LYDIA.   Back to NICOLE, selecting various items of LYDIA S clothing,  and placing them over her body, seeing how she looks in the  mirror.           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DAY   RISA S DAYDREAM.  A montage of various events, watched from  the window in Room 11.  RISA is seen talking to BILLY on her  cordless phone (Scene 34), as well as going through various  activities.  Finally, RISA is seen putting her son, SEAN,  into the schoolbus.  As the bus pulls away, RISA waves  goodbye.  RISA turns around and walks to the camera.  She  stops in front of the lens and stares into it, her  expression calm and serene.           CUT TO   INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING   Present time.  Night.  RISA is sitting on the bed, naked,  her legs crossed.  She looks to the side, lost in thought.   BILLY is behind her, putting on his clothes.      BILLY   What are you thinking?      RISA   Tomorrow I m going to put Sean on   the bus.  He won t want to go.  He   never does.  He ll cry and want to   hold on to me.      BILLY   That s because he misses you.             RISA   Yes.      BILLY   It s natural.      RISA   Your kids never cry.      BILLY   Well, maybe that s because they know   I m going to follow them.  Behind   the bus.      RISA   They can look forward to that.      BILLY   Sure.      RISA   Just like we look forward to this.   BILLY looks at RISA and smiles at her with affection.  He  moves to the door.      RISA (CONT D)   You re leaving.      BILLY   I better get back.   RISA nods.      RISA   Good night, Billy.      BILLY   Good night.   BILLY leaves.  RISA, still naked, moves to the washroom.  She stares into the tub, noticing that the white enamel that  WENDELL has applied has been washed away from BILLY S  shower.   RISA picks up a tube of the enamel, and begins to re-apply  it.           CUT TO   INT. BILLY S HOUSE. -- EVENING   NICOLE shows BILLY the clothes she has chosen.  BILLY stares  at the selection.              NICOLE   Are you sure?      BILLY   Yeah.      NICOLE   It just seems...kind of weird.      BILLY   Why?      NICOLE   I don t know.      BILLY   Nicole, I m just going to pack all   this stuff and give it to the church   for charity.  Don t feel bad.   Unless you feel strange about   wearing it.      NICOLE   No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel   wearing some of this stuff, but...I   don t feel funny about that.  I   really liked her.      BILLY   And she really liked you.  She   would ve given you all this if she d   outgrown it, or...   BILLY trails off, suddenly consumed with sadness.      NICOLE   What do you mean  outgrown it ?      BILLY   I m not sure.      NICOLE   Oh.     (beat)   Right.   NICOLE turns to leave, taking the clothes with her.      NICOLE (CONT D)   Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.      BILLY   Goodnight, Nicole.           NICOLE leaves the house and walks towards the car where her  father is waiting.           CUT TO   INT.  SAM S CAR. -- DUSK   NICOLE gets into the car beside her father.      SAM   What took so long?      NICOLE   Nothing.   SAM stares at the bundle of clothes on NICOLE s lap.      SAM   What s that?      NICOLE   Mrs.  Ansel s clothing.      SAM   Does it fit?   NICOLE nods, staring ahead, as SAM starts the car and drives  away.           CUT TO   EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT   SAM drives up the driveway to the Burnell home.  He opens  the door, and takes a blanket from the back.  NICOLE gets  out as well.  The two walk towards the barn.      NICOLE     (voice over)   Once more he stept into the street,   And to his lips again   Laid his long pipe of smooth   straight cane;   And ere he blew three notes   such sweet soft notes as yet   musician s cunning   Never gave the enraptured air -   There was a rustling, seemed like a   bustling   Of merry crowds justling at pitching   and hustling,   Small feet were pattering, wooden   shoes clattering,           Little hands clapping and little   tongues chattering,   And, like fowls in a farm-yard when   the barley is scattering,   Out came the children running.   All the little boys and girls,   With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,   And sparkling eyes and teeth like   pearls.   Tripping and skipping, ran merrily   after   The wonderful music with shouting   and laughter...   Inside the barn, SAM and NICOLE are engaged in a sexual  embrace.  The camera glides past them as NICOLE s voice  continues to read from the poem.          NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   When, lo, as they reached the   mountain-side,   A wondrous portal opened wide,   As if a cavern was suddenly   hollowed;   And the Piper advanced and the   children followed,   And when all were in to the very   last,   The door in the mountain-side shut   fast...            CUT TO   INT. BUS -- DAY   CLOSE-UP of NICOLE in the bus as it makes it s way to  school.  She seems to be listening to her own voice as it  reads from the poem.      NICOLE     (voice over)   Did I say, all?  No!  One was lame,   And could not dance the whole of   the way;   And in after years, if you would   blame   His sadness, he was used to say,-    It s dull in the town since my           playmates left!   I can t forget that I m bereft   Of all the pleasant sights they see,   Which the Piper also promised me.   For me led us, he said, to a joyous   land,   Joining the town and just at hand,   Where waters gushed and fruit-trees   grew,   And flowers put forth a fairer hue,   And everything was strange and   new...   On this last line, NICOLE s lips begin to move, as she  repeats the line out loud to herself.      NICOLE (CONT D)   Everything was strange and new.           CUT TO   EXT. ROAD. -- MORNING   A HELICOPTER shot of the schoolbus making its way through  the winter terrain.  DOLORES  voice is heard over this  sweeping panoramic shot.      DOLORES     (voice over)   By the time I reached the bottom of   Bartlett Hill Road, I had half my   load, over twenty kids, aboard.           CUT TO   EXT.  WINTER ROAD -- MORNING   The bus comes to a stop where a couple of children in bright  snow suits are waiting by the side of the road.  DOLORES  opens the door and the kids climb in.   OMITTED      DOLORES     (voice over)   They had walked to their places on   the main road from the smaller lanes      DOLORES   and private roadways that run off   it.  Bright little clusters of three   and four children - like berries   waiting to be plucked.                  CUT TO   INT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   DOLORES is continuing her conversation with MITCHELL.      DOLORES     (smiling to herself)   That s the way I thought of them   sometimes.      MITCHELL   Berries.      DOLORES   Yes.  Like I was putting them into   my big basket.  Clearing the   hillside of its children.   Pause.  MITCHELL stares at DOLORES, disturbed by this image.  DOLORES looks back at him.      DOLORES (CONT D)   Abbott and I used to do a lot of   that in the spring.      MITCHELL   Berry-picking.      DOLORES   Yes.  The old-fashioned way.      MITCHELL   And what s that?      DOLORES   With our hands.   MITCHELL nods, stealing a glance ABBOTT, who stares at him  intensely.           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING   The bus pulls up across the road from the Bide-A-Wile Motel.  DOLORES watches as RISA walks her little boy, SEAN, across  the road to the bus.      DOLORES     (voice over)   Anyhow, my next stop was across from   the Bide-A-Wile, which is owned and   operated by Risa and Wendell Walker.           Risa walked her little boy, Sean,   across the road, which was   customary.  Sean had some kind of   learning disability.      DOLORES   He was behind all the other kids his   age in school and was too fragile   and nervous to play sports.           CUT TO   INT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   DOLORES continues to talk to MITCHELL, who takes notes.      DOLORES     (smiling)   A strange little fellow, but you   couldn t help liking him.  He was   close to ten but seemed more like a   frightened five or six.      MITCHELL   Were his parents...attentive to him?      DOLORES   What do you mean?      MITCHELL   You mentioned that he had a learning   disability.      DOLORES   That s right.      MITCHELL   Did his parents attend to that?      DOLORES   What do you mean?      MITCHELL   Did they give him special care?      DOLORES   The Walkers loved Sean.  He was   their only child...the object of all   their attention.  I mean, Wendell s   a withdrawn sort of man.  That s his   nature.  But Risa, she s still got   dreams.           CUT TO           EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING   DOLORES opens the door for SEAN.  RISA is wearing a down  parka over her nightgown and bathrobe and is wearing  slippers.      RISA   Morning, Dolores.      DOLORES   Hi, Risa.  Aren t your feet   freezing?   RISA looks down at her slippers.      RISA   I guess they are.   SEAN gets to the landing of the bus, then turns around and  looks at his mother.  He extends his hands like a baby  wanting to be hugged.      SEAN   I want to stay with you.   Pause.  RISA stares at her son with great intensity and  feeling.      RISA   Go on now, Sean.  Go on.   SEAN turns away and looks into the bus full of children.      NICOLE   C mon, Sean.  Sit next to me.   MASON is sitting beside NICOLE.  NICOLE whispers something  to him, and he makes his way for SEAN.   MASON goes to the back of the bus and sits beside his  sister, JESSICA.  SEAN moves tentatively towards NICOLE.   ANGLE ON   Back on DOLORES and RISA.      DOLORES   Is he okay?      RISA   I don t know.      DOLORES           Temperature?      RISA   No.  He s not sick or anything.   It s just one of those mornings, I   guess.           CUT TO   INT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   DOLORES continues her conversation with MITCHELL STEPHENS.      DOLORES   But I never had  those mornings    myself.  Not so long as I had the   schoolbus to drive.  Not so long as   I had my kids.   DOLORES is lost in this memory, realizing she will never  drive the children again.  A tear runs down her cheek.   ABBOTT, sensing his wife s mood, activates his electric  wheelchair and maneuvers himself towards DOLORES.   MITCHELL watches as DOLORES grasps ABBOTT S hand.           CUT TO   INT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING   NICOLE is seated in the bus next to SEAN.  She is staring at  the large speedometer on the front panel.   ANGLE ON   The speedometer reads 51 miles an hour.           CUT TO   EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING   JESSICA and MASON, BILLY S children, wave at their father  from the back of the bus.           CUT TO   EXT. BILLY S PICK-UP -- MORNING   BILLY waving back at his children.  His expression suddenly  changes as he sees...           CUT TO          EXT. ROAD. -- MORNING   From BILLY S point of view, the schoolbus smashes through  the guardrail and the snowbank.  It plummets down the  embankment to the frozen-over pond.   Still upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far  side.  The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus  is swallowed at once by the freezing water.  The sound of  the ice breaking is terrifying.      DOLORES     (voice over)   It emerged from the blowing snow on   the right side of the road.  It   might have been a dog or a small   deer or maybe even a lost child.  It   might have been an optical illusion   or a mirage.  Whatever it was, for   the rest of my life I will remember   that red-brown blur...   An eerie silence as the camera stares at the scene of the  accident.           CUT TO   INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING   The camera is high above the bed, looking down on a sleeping  family.   This is the same image as from the beginning of the film.   A FATHER, a MOTHER, and a THREE YEAR OLD GIRL, naked in bed.      MITCHELL     (voice over)   Every time I get on one of these   flights to rescue Zoe, I remember   the summer we almost lost her.  She   was three years old.  It happened in   the morning, at this cottage we used   to rent.  We were all sleeping   together in bed.  It was a wonderful   time in our lives.  We still thought   we had a future together, the three   of us.  Did you ever visit the   cottage?           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT          MITCHELL is telling the story to ALISON.      ALISON   I...don t think so.      MITCHELL   I woke to the sound of Zoe s   breathing.  It was laboured.  I   looked over and noticed she was   sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed   her, rushed to the kitchen, and   splashed water on her face.      ALISON   What happened?      MITCHELL   I didn t know.  I was in a panic.  I   guessed she d been bitten by an   insect, but there was no doctor.   The nearest hospital was forty miles   away, and Zoe was continuing to   swell.  Klara took her in her arms   and tried to breast-feed her, while   I dialed the hospital.  I finally   got a doctor on the line.  He   sounded young, but cool.  He was   confident, but there was a   nervousness.  He have been an   intern.  This was the first time he   ever had to deal with anything like   this.  He wanted to seem like he   knew what he was doing, but he was   just as scared as I was.   ALISON stares at MITCHELL, taken by his need to chronicle  and detail this irrelevant stranger.           CUT TO   INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING   FATHER (YOUNG MITCHELL) is on the phone.  The camera is  behind his head.   In front of him, MOTHER (KLARA) is breast-feeding the THREE  YEAR OLD GIRL (ZOE).      MITCHELL     (voice over)   He surmised that there was a nest of   baby black widow spiders in the   mattress.  He told me they had to be   babies, or else with Zoe s body           weight she d be dead.  He told me I   had to rush her to the hospital.  He   was alone.  There was no ambulance   available.   Now you listen , he   said,  There s a good chance you can   get her to me before her throat   closes, but the important thing is   to keep her calm.   He asked if   there was one of us she was more   relaxed with than the other.  I   said,  Yes, with me.            CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT   MITCHELL continues telling the story to ALISON.      MITCHELL   Which was true enough, especially at   that moment.  Klara was wild-eyed   with fear, and her fear was   contagious.  I was a better actor   than she was, that s all.  Zoe loved   us equally then.  Just like she   hates us both equally now.     (beat)   The doctor told me that I should   hold her in my lap, and let Klara   drive to the hospital.  He asked me   to bring a small, sharp knife.  It   had to be clean.  There was no time   to sterilize properly.  He explained   how to perform an emergency   tracheotomy.  How to cut into my   daughter s throat and windpipe   without causing her to bleed to   death.  He told me there d be a lot   of blood.  I said I didn t think I   could do it.   If her throat closes   up and stops her breathing, you ll   have to, Mr. Stephens.  You ll have   a minute and a half, two minutes   maybe, and she ll probably be   unconscious when you do it.  But if   you can keep her calm and relaxed,   if you don t let her little heart   beat too fast and spread the poison   around, then you might just make it   over here first.  You get going   now , and he hung up.           CUT TO          INT. CAR -- MORNING   A little girl staring innocently into the lens as a male  voice sings a lullaby to her.   It is now recognized as MITCHELL S voice, singing to his  daughter as she is driven to the hospital.      MITCHELL     (voice over)   It was an unforgettable drive.  I   was divided into two people.  One   part of me was Daddy, singing a   lullaby to his little girl.      MITCHELL   The other part was a surgeon, ready   to cut into her throat.  I waited   for the second that Zoe s breath   stopped to make that incision.           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT   ALISON stares at MITCHELL as he finishes his story.      ALISON   What happened?      MITCHELL   Nothing.  We made it to the   hospital.  I didn t have to go as   far as I was prepared to.  But I was   prepared to go all the way.           CUT TO   EXT. ACCIDENT SITE -- DAY   An open sky.  BILLY ANSEL S face appears in the frame,  looking down at the camera.   ANGLE ON   The camera is staring down at BILLY as he identifies the  bodies of his two children.   The camera is at a great height.   As BILLY walks away, the camera floats down, slowly moving  on his face.           CUT TO           EXT. WOODS -- DAY   BILLY s P.O.V. of his wife, LYDIA, tugging a sled through  the snow.  JESSICA and MASON are on either side of her.   The three figures are seen from behind, trudging their way  through the winter landscape.   This image has a ghostly quality to it.  It is filmed in  slow motion.   Suddenly, a snowball enters the frame and hits LYDIA on the  back of the head.  She turns around, laughing into the  camera.           CUT TO   INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING   EXTREME-CLOSE-UP   BILLY in his chair in Room 11 of the Bide-A-Wile.  He is  alone, smoking a cigarette.  A slight faraway smile on his  lips.   After a moment, the door opens.  It is RISA.   They stare at each other.  Silence.      RISA   I knew you d be here.   RISA sits on the bed.  Pause.      RISA (CONT D)   Are you going to the funeral?   Pause.      BILLY   I stopped by the station a while   ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could   almost hear the kids inside.  There   was a lawyer there.  He told me he d   gotten you signed up.  Is that true?      RISA   Something made this happen, Billy.   Mr. Stephens is going to find out   what it was.      BILLY           What are you talking about?  It was   an accident.      RISA   Mr. Stephens says that someone   didn t put a right bolt in the   bus...      BILLY   Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the   garage.  There s nothing wrong with   it.      RISA   ...or that the guardrail wasn t   strong enough.      BILLY   You believe that?      RISA   I have to.      BILLY   Why?      RISA   Because I have to.      BILLY   Well I don t.   BILLY gets up to leave.      RISA   Is it true that you gave Nicole one   of Lydia s dresses?  That she was   wearing it when the bus crashed?      BILLY   Yes.      RISA   Why did you do that, Billy?      BILLY   You think that caused the accident,   Risa?  That it brought bad luck?   Christ, it sounds to me you re   looking for a witch doctor, not a   lawyer.  Or maybe they re the same   thing.   RISA is crying.  BILLY opens the door.              BILLY (CONT D)   You know what I m going to miss?   More than making love?  It s the   nights you couldn t get away from   Wendell.  It s the nights I d sit in   that chair for an hour.  Smoking   cigarettes and remembering my life   before...   BILLY stares at RISA painfully, then leaves.           CUT TO   EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT   MITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder.   The bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact.  Most  of the windows in the rear have gone.  There is a ghostly  quality to this image, as though the video light is  searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck.   MITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent  night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.  He hears  a truck approaching the garage from the distance.  It s  BILLY ANSEL.  MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY  stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the  truck.   BILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows  over the inside passenger seats.  BILLY stares at the bus a  long time.  MITCHELL approaches him.      MITCHELL   I m here about your children, Mr.   Ansel.   BILLY takes a moment, then turns around to face MITCHELL.  The two men stare at each other.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   My name is...      BILLY   Mister, I don t want to know your   name.      MITCHELL   I understand.      BILLY   No you don t.             MITCHELL   I can help you.      BILLY   Not unless you can raise the dead.   MITCHELL hands BILLY a card.      MITCHELL   Here.  You may change your mind.   BILLY looks at the card.      BILLY   Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire,   would you be likely to sue me if I   was to beat you right now?  Beat you   so bad that you pissed blood and   couldn t walk for a month.  Because   that s what I m about to do.      MITCHELL   No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn t sue you.      BILLY   Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the   people of this town alone.  You   can t help.      MITCHELL   You can help each other.  Several   people have agreed to let me   represent them in a negligence suit.   Your case as an individual will be   stronger if I m allowed to represent   you together as a group.      BILLY   Case?      MITCHELL   The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos.   Nicole Burnell s parents.  It s   important to initiate proceedings   right away.  Things get covered up.   People lie.  That s why we have to   begin our investigation quickly.   Before the evidence disappears.   That s why I m out here tonight.      BILLY   I know Risa and Wendell Walker.   They wouldn t hire a goddamned   lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn t deal           with you.  We re not country   bumpkins you can put a big city   hustle on.  You re trying to use us.      MITCHELL   You re angry, Mr. Ansel.  You owe it   to yourself to feel that way.  All   I m saying is let me direct your   rage.   BILLY stares at MITCHELL with a cold intensity.  The cell  phone in MITCHELL S car begins to ring.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   That s my daughter.  Or it may be   the police to tell me that they ve   found her dead.  She s a drug   addict.      BILLY   Why are you telling me this?      MITCHELL   I m telling you this because...   we ve all lost our children, Mr.   Ansel.      MITCHELL   They re dead to us.  They kill each   other in the streets.  They wander   comatose in shopping malls.  They re   paralyzed in front of televisions.   Something terrible has happened   that s taken our children away.   It s too late.  They re gone.   The phone continues to ring, as BILLY stares at MITCHELL.   MITCHELL turns to look at the ringing phone.           CUT TO   INT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   MITCHELL is getting ready to leave.  DOLORES is still  grasping onto ABBOTT S hand.      DOLORES   I have a question for you, Mr.   Stephens.      MITCHELL   What s that, Dolores?             DOLORES   I told you that I was doing fifty   miles an hour when the accident   happened.  That s how I remembered   it.  But the truth is, I might have   been doing sixty.  Or sixty five.   And if that s true, that I was over   the limit when the bus went over,   what would happen then?      MITCHELL   That would complicate things.      DOLORES   Because I d be to blame, right?      MITCHELL   Billy Ansel will insist that you   were driving fifty-one miles an   hour.  Just like you ve done every   morning for the past fifteen years.      DOLORES   He knows that?  Billy?      MITCHELL   Yes.  He does.      DOLORES   Billy said that?   MITCHELL nods.      DOLORES (CONT D)   You ve talked to Billy?      MITCHELL   I did.      DOLORES   And Billy told you that he ll tell   that to...      MITCHELL   Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does   not volunteer to say so in court, I   will subpoena him and oblige him to   testify to that effect.   Pause.  MITCHELL plans his next step.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   But in order to do that, you must   let me bring a suit in your name           charging negligent infliction of   emotional harm.  That s what I m now   asking you to consider.   Pause.  DOLORES is lost.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   It s clear to me and other people   that you have suffered significantly   from this event.      DOLORES   What other people?      MITCHELL   Excuse me?      DOLORES   Who s been talking to you about what   I m feeling?  Who should care about   what I m feeling?   MITCHELL stares at DOLORES.      MITCHELL   Dolores, people have to know that   you ve suffered too.      MITCHELL   And they won t understand until you   let me clear your name - your good   name - once and for all.  Will you   let me do that?  Will you let me do   my duty?   Suddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face around  his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a  string of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outburst,  DOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face.      DOLORES   You heard what Abbott said?      MITCHELL   Yes.      DOLORES   Anything you didn t understand?      MITCHELL   There might have been a word or two   that slipped by.  Maybe you could   clarify it for me, just to be   absolutely sure.              DOLORES   Abbott said that the true jury of a   person s peers is the people of her   town.  Only they, the people who   have known her all her life, and not   twelve strangers, can decide her   guilt or innocence.  And if I have   committed a crime, then it s a crime   against them, so they are the ones   who must decide my punishment.   MITCHELL stares at ABBOTT, who stares back.      MITCHELL   That s what he said, is it?      DOLORES   Yes.  Abbot understands these   things.           CUT TO   EXT. DOLORES S HOUSE -- DAY   MITCHELL leaves the DRISCOLL house, watched by DOLORES.   INT. HOSPITAL -- MORNING   NICOLE BURNELL is in bed.  A doctor, DR. ROBESON, is  touching her forehead.  NICOLE S family (SAM, her mother  MARY, and her little sister JENNY)      DR. ROBESON   The mind is kind.   The camera fixes on NICOLE S expression as she stares ahead.      NICOLE     (voice over)   They say I m lucky because I can t   remember the accident.      SAM   Don t even try to remember.      MARY   You just think about getting well,   Nicole, that s all.   The camera is always fixed on NICOLE S face when her voice  over is heard.      NICOLE             (voice over)   I know I m as well as I ever can be   again.  So shut up, Mom.  To stay   like this, to live like a slug, I m   going to have to work like someone   trying to get into the Olympics.      SAM   Just wait till you see what we ve   got waiting for you at home.           CUT TO   INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY   NICOLE, in a wheelchair, is being led down a hallway with  her family.      NICOLE     (voice over)   It s an incredible relief to be   leaving the hospital.  I m so sick   of looking at my doctor, listening   to Frankenstein ask me stupid   questions about what I was   feeling...          CUT TO   INT. HOSPITAL. LOBBY. -- DAY   NICOLE is being wheeled to the front door of the hospital.      NICOLE     (voice over,     continuing)   He thought it was cute when I called   him Frankenstein.  It wasn t.  I   feel like his monster.      MARY   Isn t it a lovely day?      NICOLE   What happened to summer?      MARY   Summer s over.  It s fall.      NICOLE   And winter?      MARY   Well, winter s far behind us now.              NICOLE   How was it?      MARY   We had a terrible winter last year,   didn t we, Sam?   SAM nods.      NICOLE   Good thing I was in Florida.   MARY doesn t know quite what to make of NICOLE S joke.  SAM  flashes NICOLE a smile.  She doesn t return it.           CUT TO   EXT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY   NICOLE arrives at home.  The car pulls up in front of the  modest house.   SAM opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it.  He points out the ramp he has built for NICOLE.   The ramp is painted green.      SAM   How do you like it, Nicole?      NICOLE   The ramp?      SAM   Pretty slick, eh?      NICOLE   Very slick.      SAM   Do you like the colour?      NICOLE   It s okay.      SAM   And I had to widen a few doors.   You ll see.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY          Inside the house.  The interior of the house is dark and  somewhat tawdry.  The BURNELL S are almost poor.   But SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built  for her.  It seems like another world.  Every detail has  been lovingly attended to.  No expense has been spared to  make this room as attractive and inviting as possible.   A room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his  crippled daughter.      SAM   What do you think?   Pause.  NICOLE wheels around, trying to control her emotions  as she inspects the room.  A phone rings in the background.  MARY goes to answer it.   NICOLE fixes her gaze at the back of the door.      NICOLE   The door needs a lock.      SAM     (taken aback)   Sure.  I ll fix it right away.   SAM goes to get his tools.  JENNY stares at NICOLE.      JENNY   Can I come and visit you here?      NICOLE   You better.  And you can sleep in my   new bed with me too.   NICOLE grabs her sister s hand, and JENNY moves in close to  her.  SAM comes back with the tools.  He starts to screw in  the hook.      NICOLE (CONT D)   That s too high.  I ll never reach   it.      SAM     (nervous)   Oh.  I better get some spackle.   SAM leaves again.      JENNY   Mommy says you need to lock the boys   out.             NICOLE   What boys?      JENNY   I don t know.   NICOLE stares at JENNY, as MARY comes back into the room.      MARY   So do you like your new room?      NICOLE   It s interesting.      MARY   Your Dad spent all his spare time in   here.  He wanted to make it   absolutely perfect.      NICOLE   I feel like a princess.   SAM comes back and begins to work on the door.  NICOLE  watches him.  She notices a new computer on a desk.      NICOLE (CONT D)   Is this mine?      MARY   Yes.  It s a present.      NICOLE   From you?      MARY   No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was   him on the phone just now.  He was   calling to see how you were.      NICOLE   Who s Mr. Stephens?      SAM   He s a lawyer.  He s our lawyer.      NICOLE   You and Mom have a lawyer?      SAM   Well, yes.  He s your lawyer too.      NICOLE   My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?             MARY   Maybe we shouldn t be talking about   this just now, with you barely home.   Aren t you hungry, honey?  Want me   to fix you something?      NICOLE   No.  What s this lawyer business?   MARY turns to JENNY.      MARY   Jenny, why don t you go and play   outside?   JENNY looks at NICOLE.      JENNY   He s given me some stuff too.  Toys,   and some books...      MARY   Jenny.   JENNY turns to leave.  When she s outside, MARY continues.      MARY (CONT D)   He s a very kind man.  And he knew   that you d need a computer for doing   schoolwork.           CUT TO   EXT. BURNELL HOME. PORCH -- DAY   NICOLE wheels her chair to the exterior porch, where she  watches her sister climb a tree.  SAM follows her outside.        SAM   It s because of the accident,   Nicole.  Most people in this town   whose kids were on the bus have got   lawyers.  A lot of people...well,   people in this town are very angry.   Us included.      NICOLE   But you didn t lose me.      MARY   No, honey.  And we will thank the   Lord for that every day and night           for the rest of our lives.  But you   almost died, and you were badly   injured, and you won t be...you   can t...      NICOLE   I can t walk anymore.   ANGLE ON   NICOLE S P.O.V. of JENNY playing on a tree branch.      SAM   You re going to need special care   for a long time to come.  It s not   going to be easy.  Not for you, not   for any of us.  Because we love you   so much.  And it s going to cost   money.  More than we can imagine.      NICOLE   What about insurance?  Doesn t   insurance pay for these things?      SAM   Partly.  But there s a lot the   insurance doesn t cover.  That s one   of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To   make sure the insurance gets paid   and to help us look after the rest.      NICOLE   How will he do that?      SAM   Well, Mr. Stephens is representing   several families.  The Ottos, the   Walkers, us, and I think a couple   more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the   town for negligence.  He s sure that   the accident could have been avoided   if they had done their jobs right.   He s a very smart man.   NICOLE stares at her sister who s at the top of the tree.  JENNY turns to look back at NICOLE.   There s a tension, as it seems as though JENNY is going to  let herself fall.      NICOLE     (voice over)   That s the first thing I heard about   you.  That you were a smart man.           That you  were so smart that you   were going to sue the town, then   make us all feel better...           CUT TO   EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT   FLASHBACK to the scene outside the gas station between  MITCHELL and BILLY.   The cell phone in MITCHELL S car has begun to ring.  The two  men stare at each other.      NICOLE     (voice over)   You re good at that.  Good at   getting people to believe you could   do something for them.  Something   they could never do for themselves.   MITCHELL breaks the silence.      MITCHELL   That s my daughter.  Or it may be   the police to tell me that they ve   found her dead.  She s a drug   addict.      BILLY   Why are you telling me this?      MITCHELL   I m telling you this because we ve   all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT   MITCHELL stares at the sleeping figure of ALISON.      MITCHELL     (voice over)   They re dead to us.           CUT TO   EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT   Back to the scene between BILLY and MITCHELL.  The cellular  phone is ringing.  MITCHELL breaks the stare with BILLY and  moves to his car.          The camera follows him, as BILLY moves back to his truck in  the background.  MITCHELL gets in his car and picks up the  phone.      MITCHELL   Yes, I ll accept the charges.      ZOE   Daddy?           CUT TO   EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- AFTERNOON      MITCHELL   Yes.      ZOE   I m calling because I ve got some   news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.      MITCHELL   News?      ZOE   Don t you want to hear?      MITCHELL   Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.      ZOE   You always think you know what I m   going to say, don t you?  You always   think you re two steps ahead of me.   The lawyer.      MITCHELL   Tell me your news, Zoe.      ZOE   Okay.  I went to sell blood   yesterday.  That s how it is.  I m   in this fucking city where my father   is a hot shit lawyer, and I m   selling my blood.      MITCHELL   That s not news, Zoe.      ZOE   No.  But this is.  They wouldn t   take my blood.           CUT TO           INT. CAR -- DAY   Image of ZOE as a little girl in MITCHELL S lap.  Her face  is swollen.  She is being driven to the hospital.   MITCHELL is singing her a lullaby.   MiTCHELL s conversation with ZOE continues over this image.      ZOE   Do you know what that means, Daddy?   Does it register?      MITCHELL   Yes.      ZOE   I tested positive.      MITCHELL   Yes.      ZOE   Welcome to hard times, Daddy.   Pause.      MITCHELL   What do you want me to do, Zoe?   I ll do whatever you want.      ZOE   I need money.      MITCHELL   What for?      ZOE   You can t ask me that!  Not anymore!   You asked me what I wanted.  Not   what I wanted it for.  I want money.      MITCHELL   Do you have the blood test?      ZOE   You don t believe me?  You don t   fucking believe me?      MITCHELL   Of...course I do.  I just   thought...I could get you another           test.  In case the one you got...was   wrong.      ZOE   I like it when you don t believe me,   Daddy.  It s better you don t   believe me but have to act like you   do.   Pause.      ZOE (CONT D)   I can hear you breathing, Daddy.      MITCHELL   Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.   ZOE begins to cry over the phone.      ZOE   Oh God, I m scared.      MITCHELL   I love you, Zoe.  I ll be there   soon, and I ll take care of you.  No   matter what happens.  I ll take care   of you.           CUT TO   INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT   MITCHELL is still staring at the sleeping figure of ALISON.   ALISON S blanket has fallen to the side.   MITCHELL lifts the blanket, and covers the sleeping figure  of the young woman.           CUT TO   EXT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY   MITCHELL drives up to the BURNELL home.  He gets out of his  car and walks to the front door.   SAM has repainted the ramp.   It is now red.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN -- DAY          MITCHELL meets NICOLE.  SAM and MARY are also seated at the  table.   The meeting takes place in the kitchen/diningroom.      MITCHELL   Well, Nicole, I ve been wanting to   meet you for a long time now.  Not   just because I ve heard so many good   things about you, but because, as   you know, I m the guy representing   you and your mom and dad and some   other folks here in town.  We re   trying to generate some   compensation, however meager, for   what you have suffered, and at the   same time see that an accident like   this never happens again.  You re   central to the case I m trying to   build, Nicole.  But you d probably   just as soon let the whole thing   lie.  Just get on with your life as   quickly and smoothly as possible.   NICOLE nods.  Pause, as MITCHELL waits for her to go on.      NICOLE   I don t like thinking about the   accident.  I don t even remember it   happening.  Besides, it just makes   people feel sorry for me, and...      MITCHELL   You hate that.   NICOLE nods.      SAM   What she means, Mitch...   MITCHELL silences SAM with a gesture of his hand.      MITCHELL   People can t help it, you know.   They really can t.  When they see   you in this wheelchair, knowing what   your life was life eight months ago,   people are going to feel sorry for   you.  There s no way around it,   Nicole.  You and I just met, and   already I admire you.  Who wouldn t?   You re a brave tough smart kid.   That s obvious.  And I didn t know   you, know how exciting and promising           your life was before the accident.   But listen, even I feel sorry for   you.      NICOLE   You can only feel lucky that you   didn t die for so long.  Then you   start to feel...unlucky.      MITCHELL   That you didn t die?  Like the other   children?      NICOLE   Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins   and Sean and...      MARY   Nicole!      NICOLE   It s the truth.   MITCHELL regards MARY with calm authority, as though he s  telling her the time.      MITCHELL   It is the truth.   Pause.  MITCHELL looks back at NICOLE.      MITCHELL (CONT D)   It would be strange if you didn t   feel that way.      NICOLE     (after a slight     pause)   What do you want me to do for you,   Mr. Stephens?           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME.  LIVINGROOM. -- DAY   TIME CUT fifteen minutes forward.  The scene shifts to the  livingroom.   MITCHELL and NICOLE are alone in the room.  SAM comes back  from another room, as MARY appears from the kitchen with a  plate of cookies.      NICOLE     (voice over)           That got you talking about   depositions and lawyers.  By the   time Daddy came back from the   washroom and Mom came in with her   tea and cookies, you were going on   about how tough it would be for me   to answer some of the questions   those other lawyers would ask .      MITCHELL   They work for the people we re   trying to sue.  Their job is to try   to minimize damages.  Our job,   Nicole, is to try to maximize them.   You have to think of it that way.   As people doing their jobs.  No good   guys or bad guys.  Just our side and   their side.      NICOLE   I won t lie.      MITCHELL   I don t want you to lie.      NICOLE   The truth is that it was an   accident, and no one s to blame.      MITCHELL   There s no such thing as an   accident, Nicole.  Not in a   situation like this.      NICOLE   You seem very sure about that.      MITCHELL   I m absolutely positive.   NICOLE turns to face SAM.  She stares at him.      NICOLE   No matter what I m asked, I ll tell   the truth.   SAM looks back, expressionless.      MITCHELL   That s fine.  I want you to be   absolutely truthful.  And I ll be   right there to advise and help you.   And there ll be a court stenographer   there to make a record of it, and           that s what ll go to the judge,   before the trial is set.  It ll be   the same for everybody.  They ll be   deposing the Ottos and the Walkers,   the bus driver...      NICOLE   Dolores.      MITCHELL   Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom   and dad.  But I ll make sure you go   last.      NICOLE   Why?      MITCHELL   So you can keep on getting well   before you have to go and do this.   It s not going to be easy, Nicole.   Do you understand that?   NICOLE nods.      SAM   When do they award damages?      MITCHELL   Depends.  This could drag on for   quite a while.  But we ll be there   at the end, Sam.  Don t you worry.      NICOLE     (voice over)   At that moment, I hated my parents -   Daddy for what he knew and had done,      NICOLE   and even Mom for what she didn t   know and hadn t done.  You told me   it wasn t going to be easy.  But as   I sat there, staring at Daddy, I   knew it was going to be the easiest   thing in my life.           CUT TO   EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING   REPLAY of the scene of SEAN WALKER entering the bus.  He  turns around to face his mother.      SEAN           I want to stay with you.      RISA   Go on now.  Go on.   SEAN hesitantly turns to face the inside of the bus.  He  sees NICOLE BURNELL, who pats the seat beside her.   MASON leaves his place beside NICOLE to make way for SEAN.      NICOLE   C mon, Sean, sit next to me.   ANGLE ON   DOLORES as she watches SEAN move towards NICOLE.           CUT TO   INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY   DOLORES gives her deposition.  A stenographer takes notes.  MITCHELL listens, along with SCHWARTZ, the opposing lawyer.      DOLORES   He never took his eyes off his   mother, even as he moved to sit   beside Nicole.  He looked   frightened.      MITCHELL   Why would he be frightened?      DOLORES   I don t know.  But it was weird in   terms of what happened next.  Sean   was still watching his mother.      DOLORES   I shut the door with one hand, and   released the brake with the other,   and waited for a second for Risa to   cross in front of the bus.  There   was a sixteen wheeler behind me, and   I heard his air brakes hiss as the   driver chunked into gear.  I looked   into the side view mirror, and saw   him move into line behind me.  Then   suddenly Sean shrieked...           CUT TO   INT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING          SEAN leaps to the front of the bus.      SEAN   Mommy!      MITCHELL     (voice over, from     the court chamber)   What happened then?      DOLORES     (voice over)   Sean was all over me, scrambling   across my lap to the window.  I   glimpsed  Risa off to my left,   leaping out of the way of a red Saab   that seemed to have bolted out of   nowhere.   The scene is horrifying, as SEAN watches his mother just  missing a terrible accident with the speeding vehicle.      DOLORES (CONT D)   Sean!  Sit down!  Your Mom s okay!   Now sit down!   SEAN sits back down beside NICOLE.  DOLORES slides open her  window, and speaks to RISA.      DOLORES (CONT D)   You get his number?   RISA is stunned.      DOLORES (CONT D)     (voice over)   She was shaken, standing there with   her arms wrapped around herself.      DOLORES   She shook her head, turned away, and   walked slowly back to the office.  I   drew a couple of breaths and checked   Sean, who was seated now but still   craning and looking after his   mother.           CUT TO   INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY   The deposition continues.      DOLORES           I smiled at him, but he only glared   back at me, as if I was to blame.           CUT TO   EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING   AERIAL VIEW of the bus as it makes its way through the  mountains.  NICOLE S voice is heard reading The Pied Piper  from the scene with the ANSEL children.      NICOLE     (voice over)   For he led us, he said, to a joyous   land,   Joining the town and just at hand,   Where waters gushed and fruit-trees   grew,   And flowers put forth a fairer hue,   And everything was strange and   new...           CUT TO   INT. SCHOOL BUS -- DAY   A montage showing the faces of the various children in the  bus.  These images are intercut with DOLORES S deposition.           CUT TO   INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY   The deposition.  DOLORES is trying to control her emotions.      DOLORES   I remember wrenching the steering   wheel to the right and slapping my   foot against the brake petal.  I   wasn t the driver anymore.      DOLORES   The bus was like this huge wave   about to break over us.  Bear Otto,   the Lambston kids, the Hamiltons,   the Prescotts, the teenaged boys and   girls from Bartlett Hill, Sean,   Nicole Burnell, Billy Ansel s twins,   Jessica and Mason...all the children   of my town.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT           SAM and JENNY are watching television.  Lumberjack log-  rolling.   NICOLE, in her wheelchair, is reading a book off to one  corner.  MARY comes into the room.      MARY   That was Billy Ansel on the phone.   He wants to come over to talk to us.      SAM   Did he say what about?      MARY   No.      SAM   Was he drinking?  Could you tell?      MARY   Jenny, it s time for you to go to   bed.      JENNY   Mom...      SAM   Come on, Jen.  I let you watch your   nature show.   JENNY reluctantly kisses her father goodnight, then NICOLE.  As she leaves the room, MARY starts clearing the table.      SAM (CONT D)   Is he coming over now?  Right away?      MARY   That s what he said.   SAM is anxious.  He looks over to NICOLE.      SAM   What are you up to, Nicole?      NICOLE   Nothing.      SAM   Nothing good on your T.V.?      NICOLE   As opposed to this T.V.?          NICOLE stares at SAM.      NICOLE (CONT D)   Besides, I d like to see Billy.   NICOLE stares at the television.   ANGLE ON   On the television screen, an image of a studio audience  applauding.  The image is silent.  The T.V. is on MUTE.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   That wasn t true.  I didn t want to   be seen by anyone whose kids had   been killed by the accident.   Especially not Billy Ansel.   NICOLE turns her attention back to her parents.      NICOLE (CONT D)   Actually, now that I think about it,   I d just as soon stay in my room.   NICOLE shoves her wheelchair towards her room, as the camera  remains on her face.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   I remembered all the times I had   tucked Jessica and Mason into bed.   How they loved to have me read to   them before they slept.  There was   nothing for me to say to Billy,   except I m sorry.  I m sorry that   your children died when my parent s   children didn t.           CUT TO   EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT   BILLY pulls up to the BURNELL home.  He gets out of his pick  up and approaches the house.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT   From her room, NICOLE watches as BILLY approaches the house.          He leaves her view as a knock is heard at the door.  NICOLE  wheels over to the door and presses her ear to the door so  that she can hear the conversation.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN. -- NIGHT      SAM   Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on   a night like this?  C mon in.  Take   a load off.      MARY   Would you like a cup of tea, Billy?   There s a piece of cake left.      BILLY   No.  No, thanks, Mary.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN/LIVINGROOM -- NIGHT   SAM leads BILLY into the livingroom.      SAM   So what brings you out tonight?      BILLY   Well, Sam, I might as well tell you   the truth.  It s this lawsuit you ve   gotten yourself all involved with.   I want you to drop the damned thing.   Pause.      SAM   I don t see how that concerns you,   Billy.      BILLY   It does concern me.      SAM   Well, I don t know why it should.   There s a whole lot of people in   town involved with lawsuits.  We re   hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean,   I can understand how you feel.      BILLY   How?             SAM   Well, it being so depressing and   all.  But it s reality.  You can t   just turn this off because you   happen to think it s a bad idea.      BILLY   Why not?      SAM   Because it s what we have to do.      BILLY   Well I don t want a damned thing to   do with it.      SAM   Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.   Pause.  BILLY stares at SAM.  Tension.      BILLY   I ve tried to stay out of it.  But   it turns out that s not so easy,   Sam.  You ve gone and got yourself   this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens.   You and Risa and Wendell and the   Ottos.      SAM   So?  I mean, lot s of folks have got   lawyers.      BILLY   But yours is the one who s going to   subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to   testify in court.  He came by the   garage this afternoon.  Gave me this   piece of paper.   BILLY reaches into his pocket and shows the paper to SAM.      MARY   Why would he do that?  You didn t   have anything to do with the   accident.      BILLY   Because I was driving behind the   bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw   it happen...   BILLY is harrowed by this image.  SAM and MARY stare at him,  frightened by his intensity.              BILLY (CONT D)   If that bastard does subpoena me, if   he forces me to go over this again,   then all those other lawyers will   line up behind him and try and do   the same thing.      SAM   That won t happen, Billy.  Mitch   Stephens  case is small, compared to   some of those other guys.  The way   he told me, all he needs is for you   to say what you saw that day,   driving behind the bus.  I know it s   a painful thing to do, but it ll   only take a few minutes of your   time.  That ll be the end of it.      BILLY   That s wrong, Sam.  You know that.   We ll be tangled up in this thing   for the next five years.  This is   never going to go away...      SAM   C mon, you know that won t...      BILLY   We ve got lawyers suing lawyers   because some people were stupid   enough to sign on with more than one   of the bastards.  We ve got people   pointing fingers, making side deals,   and dickering over percentages.   Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to   sue the rescue squad.  The rescue   squad.  Because they didn t act fast   enough.   ANGLE ON   NICOLE listening from her door.      BILLY (CONT D)   If you two dropped the case, then   the others would come to their   senses      BILLY   and follow.  You re good sensible   parents, you and Mary.  People   respect you.          Pause.      SAM   No, Billy.  We can t drop the   lawsuit.  You know how much we need   the money.      BILLY   Why?  You got money from Dolores    insurance with the school board.  We   all did.      SAM   It s not enough.  For hospital   bills.  For Nicole.      BILLY   I ll help pay for Nicole, if that s   what you re really talking about.   I ll even give you the money I got   for my kids.     (beat)   That s what we used to do, remember?   Help each other.  This was a   community.      SAM   I m sorry.   BILLY stares at SAM.      BILLY   I used to like it here.  I used to   care about what happened.  Now I   think I ll sell my house and move   the fuck away.      MARY   Billy, please.  The children.      BILLY   The children.   BILLY looks at SAM and MARY, s strange smile on his face.  He moves to leave.  He pauses at the door of the kitchen.      BILLY (CONT D)   How is Nicole?  Is she around?      MARY   She s resting.  In her room.      BILLY   Say hello for me.                   CUT TO   EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT   BILLY walks to his car.  SAM and MARY watch him from the  porch/ramp.      SAM     (calling out)   We re getting on with our lives,   Billy.  Maybe it s time you got on   with yours.   BILLY turns around, looks at SAM one final time, then moves  to his pick up.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT   NICOLE is watching BILLY from her window.  She is crying.   ANGLE ON   NICOLE S P.O.V. of BILLY driving away.           CUT TO   INT. BURNELL HOME.  NICOLE S BEDROOM. -- NIGHT   NICOLE is lying in her bed.  A knock at the door.  SAM  enters the dark bedroom and sits on the bed beside her.      SAM   Are you sleeping?      NICOLE   No.      SAM   Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants   you to make your deposition at the   courthouse.  I thought I d take you   over.      NICOLE   Great.      SAM   You seem...I don t know...well,   distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.      NICOLE           We used to talk a lot, didn t we,   Daddy.  About all the things you   were going to do for me.      SAM   What do you mean?      NICOLE   I mean I m a wheelchair girl now.   It s hard to pretend I m a beautiful   rock star.  Not like you used to   tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the   people that were going to discover   me?  Where are they now?   SAM turns away from NICOLE.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   He couldn t look at me.  But I   looked at him.  Right at him.  His   secret was mine now.  We used to   share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I   owned it completely.      SAM   Well, okay.  I ll take you about   nine-thirty in the morning.  That s   okay with you?      NICOLE   Great.   Silence.  SAM gets up to leave the room.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   Before, everything had been so   confusing.  I never knew who was to   blame.  But now I know.  He s just a   thief, a sneaky thief who had robbed   his daughter.  Robbed me   of...whatever it was that my sister   still had and I didn t.  And then   the accident robbed me of my body.           CUT TO   INT. CAR -- DAY   SAM and NICOLE are driving to town.  They don t exchange a  word.           CUT TO           EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY   SAM is carrying NICOLE up the stairs of the community  centre.   There is no ramp, so the wheelchair is left at the bottom.   He is having difficulty, because NICOLE is keeping her body  stiff and won t hold on to him.           CUT TO   INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY   NICOLE is wheeled across the floor of the community centre  to a table where the depositions are being made.  MITCHELL,  SCHWARTZ, and the STENOGRAPHER are waiting for her.      NICOLE     (voice over)   The last time I was in the community   hall was for the big Christmas party   almost a year ago.  It hadn t   changed.           CUT TO   INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY   The deposition.  SAM watches his daughter as she speaks  confidently into the microphone.  The STENOGRAPHER takes  notes.   NICOLE is answering questions from the opposing lawyer.  MITCHELL is also taking notes.      SCHWARTZ   Now on that morning, did there come   a time, Nicole, when you left your   parents  house?      NICOLE   Yes.      SCHWARTZ   What time in the morning was this?      NICOLE   About eight-thirty in the morning.      SCHWARTZ   Was anyone waiting for the bus with   you?              NICOLE   No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny   was sick and stayed home that day.      SCHWARTZ   Was there anything unusual about the   driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus   that particular morning?      NICOLE   Like what?  I mean, I don t remember   a lot.   ANGLE ON MITCHELL      MITCHELL   I object to the form of that   question.  Note that.      SCHWARTZ   Was the bus on time?      NICOLE   Yes.      SCHWARTZ   And where did you sit that morning?      NICOLE   My usual place.  On the right side.   The first seat.      SCHWARTZ   And according to your recollection,   there was nothing unusual about the   drive that morning?      NICOLE   Until the accident?  No.     (beat)   Yes, there was.   ANGLE ON MITCHELL   Worried about this new information.      NICOLE (CONT D)   It was when Sean Walker got on.  He   was crying and didn t want to leave   his mother.  Mason Ansel was sitting   beside me.  I asked him to move, so   I could quiet Sean down.  When the   bus started up, a car came around           the corner and almost hit Sean s   mother.  She was okay, but it really   scared Sean, because he watched it   out the window.      SCHWARTZ   And was this incident caused in any   way by anything the driver of the   bus did?   Pause.  MITCHELL is nervous.      NICOLE   No, she hadn t even started to move   the bus.  It was the car s fault.   MITCHELL is relieved.      SCHWARTZ   There was nothing reckless in Mrs.   Driscoll s behavior?      MITCHELL   I object to that form of question.   Note that.      NICOLE     (answering the     question)   No.      SCHWARTZ   Did there come a time when all the   children had been picked up?      NICOLE   Yes.      SCHWARTZ   You remember that much?      NICOLE   As I m talking, I m remembering more   about it.   MITCHELL is worried.      MITCHELL   Note my objection.  She said,  As   I m talking.       SCHWARTZ   Did there come a time when the bus   turned off Staples Mill Road onto           the Marlowe Road at what s called   Wilmot Springs?      NICOLE   Yes.      NICOLE   There was a brown dog that ran   across the road up there, right by   the dump, and Dolores slowed down   not to hit him, and he ran into the   woods.  And then Dolores drove on   and turned onto the Marlowe road, as   usual.  I remember that.  I m   remembering it pretty clearly.      SCHWARTZ     (eyebrows raised)   You are?      NICOLE   Yes.      MITCHELL     (worried)   Note that she said  pretty clearly .   Not  clearly .      SCHWARTZ   And what was the weather like at   this time?      NICOLE   It was snowing.      MITCHELL   Unless the report from the National   Weather Bureau for the district on   January 23 goes into the record, I   will object to that question.      SCHWARTZ   I will offer that report.  Well,   then, now that your memory seems to   be clearing, can you tell us what   else  you observed at that time?      NICOLE   Before the actual accident?      SCHWARTZ   Yes.   NICOLE stares at her father as she responds.              NICOLE   I was scared.      SCHWARTZ   Why were you scared?      SCHWARTZ   This is before the accident, Nicole.   Do you understand what I m asking?      NICOLE   Yes, I understand.      SCHWARTZ   Why were you scared?      NICOLE   Dolores was driving too fast.   Silence.  MITCHELL is watching his entire case crumble.      SCHWARTZ   Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast?   What made you think that, Nicole?      NICOLE   The speedometer.  And it was   downhill there.      SCHWARTZ   You could see the speedometer?      NICOLE   Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly   now.  It seemed we were going too   fast down the hill.  I was scared.   NICOLE looks at MITCHELL, who stares back.      SCHWARTZ   How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll   was going?  To the best of your   recollection?      NICOLE   Seventy-two miles an hour.      SCHWARTZ   Seventy-two miles an hour?  You re   sure of this?      NICOLE   Positive.              SCHWARTZ   You believe that the bus driven by   Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy-   two miles an hour at this time?      NICOLE   I told you I was positive.  The   speedometer was large and easy to   see from where I was.   ANGLE ON   The speedometer from NICOLE S P.O.V.  It reads fifty-one  miles an hour.      SCHWARTZ     (voice over)   You saw the speedometer?      NICOLE   Yes.      SCHWARTZ   Did you say anything to Mrs.   Driscoll?      NICOLE   No.      SCHWARTZ   Why not?      NICOLE   I was scared.  And there wasn t   time.      SCHWARTZ   There wasn t time?      NICOLE   No.  Because the bus went off the   road.  And crashed.      SCHWARTZ   You remember this?      NICOLE   Yes.  I do now.  Now that I m   telling it.      MITCHELL     (defeated)           She said,  Now that I m telling it .   Note that.      SCHWARTZ   What do you remember about the   accident?      NICOLE   I remember the bus swerved, it just   suddenly swerved to the right, and   it hit the guardrail and the   snowbank on the side of the road,   and then it went over the embankment   there, and everyone was screaming   and everything.  And that s all.  I   guess I was unconscious after that.   That s all.  Then I was in the   hospital.   SCHWARTZ smiles and makes some notes in his pad.  He talks  to MITCHELL without looking up.      SCHWARTZ   Do you have any questions, Mr.   Stephens?   MITCHELL stares silently at NICOLE for a long time.      NICOLE     (voice over)   Daddy was leaning forward in his   chair, his mouth half open, as if he   wanted to say something.  Like what,   Daddy?  Like  What about my money?    NICOLE and SAM stare at each other.      MITCHELL   I have no questions.      SCHWARTZ   Thank you, Nicole.   NICOLE wheels herself away.  She passes MITCHELL.      MITCHELL     (in a low voice)   You d make a great poker player,   kid.   NICOLE wheels herself over to her father.      NICOLE   Let s go, Daddy.           EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY   NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She  stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps.      NICOLE     (voice over)   Daddy took a long time.  I guess he   wanted to have a few words with you.   He must have tried to tell you that   I was lying.  Then you would tell   Daddy that it didn t matter if I was   lying or not, the lawsuit is dead.   As NICOLE S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and  MITCHELL arguing is seen.   The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE S voice  over.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   Everyone s lawsuit is dead.  Forget   it.  Tell the others to forget it.   It s over.  Right now, Sam, the   thing you ve got to worry about is   why she lied.  A kid who d do that   to her own father is not normal,   Sam.   SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down  at the driver s seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the  car.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (voice over)   But Daddy knows who lied.  He knows   who the liar is.  He knows who s   normal.   SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next.      NICOLE (CONT D)     (speaking to SAM)   I hope he lets us keep the computer.   SAM turns to look at NICOLE.      NICOLE (CONT D)   I d like an ice cream.           CUT TO          INT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING   MITCHELL is at the baggage section of the arrival area,  waiting for his luggage.   He watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing  his daughter, playing with the little girl.   PETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the  air as she laughs.   MITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image  of father and daughter.  ALISON approaches him.      ALISON   Well, it was nice meeting you again,   Mr. Stephens.      MITCHELL   Mitchell.  It was nice to see you   again, Ally.      ALISON   Alison.      MITCHELL   Alison.      ALISON   Say hi to Zoe.      MITCHELL   I will.      ALISON   I hope she gets better.      MITCHELL   I ll tell her that.   ALISON shakes MITCHELL S hand, and leaves.           CUT TO   EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY   SAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession  stand that was seen at the beginning of the film.  NICOLE is  licking an ice-cream cone.  Around them, people are setting  up the bandstand.      NICOLE   Daddy, can we come to the fair?             SAM   Yes.      NICOLE   How about Sunday night?  That s   always the best time.      SAM   Okay.   NICOLE looks at a team of men constructing a ride.  A school  bus pulls up, and a group of children spill out.  NICOLE  watches as the driver tries to form them into a group.      NICOLE   What s going to happen to Dolores?      SAM   I don t know.      NICOLE   Will the police do anything to her?      SAM   It s too late for that.  She can t   drive the bus anymore.  The school   board saw to that right off.      NICOLE   She ll move away.      SAM   There s talk of that.      NICOLE   Someplace where no one knows her.     (beat)   Someplace strange and new.   SAM is frozen.  NICOLE smiles to herself.           CUT TO   EXT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING   At the airport, in the arrivals bay, MITCHELL waits for his  limousine.   Across the road, a hotel minibus is parked.  The driver is  DOLORES.  The camera settles on her face as she stares at  MITCHELL.   MITCHELL catches her gaze, and the two stare at each other.             NICOLE     (voice over)   As you see each other, almost two   years later, I wonder if you realize   something.   MITCHELL S limo arrives.  He gets inside.           CUT TO   INT. LIMOUSINE -- MORNING   CLOSE-UP of MITCHELL as he stares ahead, lost in thought.      NICOLE     (voice over)   I wonder if you realize that all of   us - Dolores, me, the children who   survived, the children who didn t -   that we re all citizens of a   different town now.           CUT TO   EXT. GAS STATION -- DAY   BILLY watches as a crane lifts the demolished schoolbus onto  a flatbed truck.      NICOLE     (voice over)   A town of people living in the sweet   hereafter.           CUT TO   EXT. CAR -- AFTERNOON   NICOLE and SAM driving home from the fairground.      NICOLE     (voice over)   Whether others defend us, protect   us, love us or hate us - they do it   to meet their own needs, not ours.   The camera leaves the car to look up at the sky.          CUT TO   EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DUSK   Sunday night at the fairground.  NICOLE is staring at the  ferris wheel.  In her imagination, the swinging cars of the          slowly turning wheel are full of children.  The laughter and  noise is haunting.   NICOLE smiles as she stares at this private apparition.      NICOLE     (voice over)   This is what I learned.  This is   what I found out.           CUT TO   INT. BILLY S HOUSE. JESSICA AND MASON S BEDROOM. -- NIGHT   NICOLE has just finished reading a story to JESSICA and  MASON.  The children are asleep.  NICOLE puts the book down,  and kisses the two sleeping children on the cheek.   NICOLE gets up to leave the bedroom, leaving the door  slightly open.   Light spills in from the hallway.

Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING                 in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER,                 MORE compromising one. Then another, and another.

GITTES  OFFICE                 CURLY drops the photos on Gittes  desk. Curly towers over                 GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman s clothes, his                 breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes                  shiny desk top.                 Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at                 it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite                 the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a                 cigarette using a lighter with a  nail  on his desk.                 Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist                 into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts                 to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left                 a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos                 of several movie stars askew.                 Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He                 is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually                 bites into the blinds.                 Gittes doesn t move from his chair.                                       GITTES                          All right, enough is enough. You                           can t eat the Venetian blinds, Curly.                           I just had  em installed on Wednesday.                 Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes                 reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly                 selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of                 more expensive whiskeys.                 Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his                 desk toward Curly.                                       GITTES                          Down the hatch.                 Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it.                 He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry                 quietly.                                       CURLY                               (drinking, relaxing a                                little)                          She s just no good.

Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between                 Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.                 Gittes gives him an irritated glance.

BAGBY                          Gentlemen, today you can walk out                           that door, turn right, hop on a                           streetcar and in twenty-five minutes                           end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.                           Now you can swim in it, you can fish                           in it, you can sail in it but you                           can t drink it, you can t water your                           lawns with it, you can t irrigate an                           orange grove with it.  Remember we                           live next door to the ocean but we                           also live on the edge of the desert.                           Los Angeles is a desert community.                           Beneath this building, beneath every                           street there s a desert. Without                           water the dust will rise up and cover                           us as though we d never existed!

He yawns, edges                 away from one of the dirtier farmers.                                       BAGBY (O.S.)

AUDIENCE \\x96 COUNCIL CHAMBERS                 An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have                 been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers                 applaud.                 Somebody shooshes them.                 COUNCIL COMMITTEE                 In a whispered conference.                                       COUNCILMAN                               (acknowledging Bagby)                          Mayor Bagby... let s hear from the                           departments again. I suppose we better                           take Water and Power first. Mr.                           Mulwray.                 REACTION \\x96 GITTES                 Looking up with interest from his racing form.                 MULWRAY                 Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in                 his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising                 fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The                 man turns the overleaf on the map.                                       MULWRAY                          In case you ve forgotten, gentlemen,                           over five hundred lives were lost                           when the Van der Lip Dam gave way                           core samples have shown that beneath                           this bedrock is shale similar to the                           permeable shale in the Van der Lip                           disaster.  It couldn t withstand                           that kind of pressure there.                               (referring to a new                                overleaf)                          Now you propose yet another dirt                           banked terminus dam with slopes of                           two and one half to one, one hundred                           twelve feet high and a twelve thousand                           acre water surface. Well, it won t                           hold. I won t build it. It s that                           simple. I am not making that kind of                           mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.                 Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly                 there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the                 chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny,                 bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.                                       COUNCIL PRESIDENT                               (shouting to farmer)                          What in the hell do you think you re                           doing?                               (as the sheep bleat                                down the aisles toward                                the Council)                          Get those goddam things out of here!

You don t                           have an answer for that so quick, do                           you?                 Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations                 of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the                 farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he s going to                 bodily attack Mulwray.                                       FARMER                               (through above, to                                Mulwray)                          You steal the water from the valley,                           ruin the grazing, starve my livestock                           who s paying you to do that, Mr.                           Mulwray, that s what I want to know!                 L.A. RIVERBED \\x96 LONG SHOT                 It s virtually empty. Sun blazes off it s ugly concrete banks.                 Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked                 with weeds.                 After a moment, Mulwray s car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood                 control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray                 gets out of the car. Me looks around.                 WITH GITTES                 Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the                 flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover.                 He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of                 the riverbed.                 There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at                 the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.                 GITTES                 Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray s                 glasses.                 BELOW GITTES                 There s the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping.                 Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into                 the riverbed, and into Gitte s view.                 MULWRAY                 Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power                 lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water                 at his feet.                 He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound,                 toward Gittes.                 GITTES                 Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in                 the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the                 muddy banks.                 Mulwray says something to the boy.                 The boy doesn t answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground.                 The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud                 and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.                 After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly                 back upstream \\x96 scrambling up the bank to his car.                 There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of                 blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the                 hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking                 downstream from time to time.                 The power lines overhead HUM.                 He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets                 back in the car. He drives off.                 GITTES                 Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right                 back out.                 The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back                 seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in                 and takes off.                 POINT FERMIN PARK \\x96 DUSK                 Street lights go on.                 MULWRAY                 Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park                 lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.                 GITTES                 Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in                 the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees                 in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of                 the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes                 moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating                 the climb than Mulwray did.                 DOWN ON THE BEACH                 Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear                 crescent.                 He looks to his left. There s a promontory of sorts. It s                 apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then                 moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in                 order to be above Mulwray.                 AT THE OUTFALL                 Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.                 Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks                 absently up toward Gittes.                 GITTES                 Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.                 BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN                 Flashing in the dust.                 CLOSE \\x96 GITTES                 Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He s in a puddle                 of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.                 MULWRAY                 Below him in watching the water trickling down from the                 outfall near Gittes.                 Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated.                 Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and                 velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading                 into the sea, whipping it into a foam.                 AT THE STREET \\x96 GITTES  CAR                 There s a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper.                 Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash                 light. It says:                  SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR                 PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!!                 VOTE YES NOVEMBER 6... CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY,                 HON. SAM BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR \\x96 CHAIRMAN.  Gittes grumbles,                 crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other                 flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.                 Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.                 INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT                 Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches.                 The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls out                 one.                 He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch.                 It s 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray s car and places it behind                 the front wheel of Mulwray s car. He yawns again and heads                 back to his own car.                 GITTES                 Arrives whistling, opens the door with  J.J. GITTES AND                 ASSOCIATES \\x96 DISCREET INVESTIGATION  on it.

Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh s. A little                 red light is on in the corner, over a closed door. Gittes                 walks over and knocks on the door.                                       GITTES                          Where d he go yesterday?

Gittes walks to his office.                 ON HIS DESK                 Is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken, the hands stopped                 at 2:47.                                       GITTES                          He was there all night.                 Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series                 of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.

He s found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in                 Echo Park.

They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print                 dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on                 the girl.                                       GITTES                               (to Duffy, as they                                pass)                          Let s have a big smile, pal.                 He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast                 shots.                 Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.                 DUFFY                 Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes                 again clicking off several fast shots.

Gittes is clicking                 off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come                 loose.                 Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the                 roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to                 slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide.                 Gittes stops himself at the roof s edge by the storm drain                 and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his                 feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the                 veranda below. He stops as it s about to slide over the edge.                 He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the                 cracked edge of the tile falls.                 WITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL                 Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the                 girl.                 He s clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof.                 FROM HIS POV                 The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly                 sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.

(Gittes breaks up)                          ...you re screwing like a Chinaman.                  Gittes hangs onto Sophie s desk laughing his ass off. The                 little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees                 the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She s so                 stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.                                       YOUNG WOMAN                          Mr. Gittes?                                       GITTES                          Yes?                                       YOUNG WOMAN                          Do you know me?                                       GITTES                          Well... I think I... I would ve                           remembered.                                       YOUNG WOMAN                          Have we ever met?                                       GITTES                          Well, no.                                       YOUNG WOMAN                          Never?                                       GITTES                          Never.                                       YOUNG WOMAN                          That s what I thought. You see, I m                           Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr.                           Mulwray s wife.                 Gittes is staggered. He glances down at the newspaper.                                       GITTES                          Not that Mulwray?                                       EVELYN                          Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And                           since you agree with me we ve never                           met, you must also agree that I                           haven t hired you to do anything.                           Certainly not spy on my husband. I                           see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.                           Well, you re going to get it.                                       GITTES                          Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...                 She s walked past him toward the door. He stop her.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          ...there s some misunderstanding                           here. It s not going to do any good                           to get tough with me.                 Evelyn flashes a cold smile.                                       EVELYN                          I don t get tough with anybody, Mr.                           Gittes.  My lawyer does.                 Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This                 time he s stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come                 out of his office and up behind him.                                       GRAY-HAIRED MAN                          Here s something for you, Mr. Gittes.                 Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons                 and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door.                                       GRAY-HAIRED MAN                               (continuing; pleasantly)                          I suppose we ll be hearing from your                           attorney.                 Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand.                 INT. GITTES  INNER OFFICE \\x96 GITTES, DUFFY & WALSH                 On Gittes  desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons                 and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him                 from the barber shop.                 The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing                 gum is the loudest noise in the room.                 Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops                 chewing.                 Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee                 cups.

DUFFY                          I said okay, Jake.                                       GITTES                          Yeah, yeah. If she d come in here                           saying she was Shirley Temple you d                           say okay to that, too.                                       WALSH                          Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray s                           real phone number and address.                                       GITTES                          All she needed for that was the phone                           book!                                       WALSH                          No, no. She said not to call, her                           husband might answer.                                       GITTES                          When I find out who that phony bitch                           was.                 Gittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly grabs                 the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile breaks out                 on his face.                 He buzzes Sophie.                                       GITTES                          Sophie.                                       SOPHIE                          Yes, Mr. Gittes.

Coming in waving her lawyers and her                           money at me \\x96 so goddam smug.

GITTES                               (continuing)                          Whitey, what s new, pal?... Yeah,                           listen, where did you get those                           photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse                           over the El Macando love nest.

(Gittes laughs a little                                hysterically)                          Why would I be asking how you got                           them if I sent them?...

DEPARTMENT WATER & POWER \\x96 HALL                 Gittes stops outside a door marked:                               HOLLIS J. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER                  He enters an outer office. The SECRETARY looks surprised.                                       GITTES                          Mr. Mulwray, please.                                       SECRETARY                          He s not in, Mr.?                                       GITTES                          Gittes.                                       SECRETARY                          May I ask what this is regarding?                                       GITTES                          It s personal. Has he been out long?                                       SECRETARY                          Since lunch.                                       GITTES                          Gee whiz.                               (he glances at his                                watch)                          And I m late.                                       SECRETARY                          He was expecting you?                                       GITTES                          Fifteen minutes ago. Why don t I go                           in and wait?                 Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half                 rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.                 MULWRAY S INNER OFFICE                 The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray                 at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas                 and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted                 photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.                 Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in                 the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he                 does.                 He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly                 examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn t                 open.                 He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.                 He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles                 through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it,                 finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a                 Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,                 He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray s neat                 hand:                         Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used.                  Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent                 pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the                 drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray s glasses                 off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on                 the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.                 RUSS YELBURTON                 Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.                                       YELBURTON                          Can I help you?                               (extending his hand)                          Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the                           Department.                                       GITTES                               (equally pleasant)                          J.J. Gittes. And it s not a                           departmental matter.                                       YELBURTON                          I wonder if you d care to wait in my                           office?                 This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods,                 follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices                 down the hall.                                       YELBURTON                               (continuing; as they re                                going)                          You see, this whole business in the                           paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on                           edge.                 INT. YELBURTON OFFICE                 Smaller than Mulwray s, he has most noticeably a lacquered                 marlin mounted on the wall. There are a couple of other                 pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he s                 standing beside.                 There s also a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C.                 below it, tacked onto the wall.                                       YELBURTON                          After all, you work with a man for a                           certain length of time, you come to                           know him, his habits, his values,                           and so forth. Well either he s the                           kind who chases after women or he                           isn t.

GITTES                          Maybe he takes it very seriously.                 Gittes winks. Yelburton chuckles appreciatively, loosening                 up a little.                                       GITTES                          You don t happen to know where Mr.                           Mulwray s having lunch?

Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton s desk.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Mind if I take one of your cards?                            In case I want to get in touch with                           you again.                                       YELBURTON                          Help yourself.                 Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his                 handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running                 into a man who is standing by the Secretary s desk, about                 GITTES  age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in                 a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper                 bag.                                       GITTES                          Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?

You don t drink                           it, you don t take a bath in it,                           maybe they sent you a letter. Ah,                           but then you d have to be able to                           read.                 Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury. Yelburton                 steps between them.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.

MULWRAY HOUSE \\x96 GITTES                 Rings the bell. He waits.                 A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-jacket                 of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.                                       GITTES                          J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.                 He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler                 takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the                 doorway.                 Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim                 a hedge. There s a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet                 off the porch.                 POV \\x96 GARAGE                 A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a                 chamois.                 Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come                 from the chamois.                 CHINESE BUTLER                 In doorway.                                       CHINESE BUTLER                          Please.                 Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for                 him to follow.                 THROUGH THE HOUSE \\x96 GITTES                 Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A                 maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some                 French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with                 running water.                                       CHINESE BUTLER                          You wait, please.                 Gittes is left standing by the pond. It s suddenly very quiet                 except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing.                 After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles                 at Gittes, probes into the pond.                 There s something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes                 it.                 After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters                 recede.                 EXT. POND \\x96 GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER \\x96 DAY                                       GARDENER                               (to Gittes)                          Bad for glass.                                       GITTES                               (not understanding)                          Yeah sure. Bad for glass.                 The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the                 object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.                 He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks                 it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the                 gleaming object.                 He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the                 trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto                 it for poise.                 Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside                 of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.                 She s wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks                 younger than she did in the office.                                       EVELYN                          Yes, Mr. Gittes?                 Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed                 as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.                                       GITTES                          Actually, I m here to see your                           husband, Mrs. Mulwray.                 He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There                 is none.                 The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.                                       EVELYN                          Would you like something to drink?                                       GITTES                          What are you having?                                       EVELYN                          Iced tea.                                       GITTES                          Yeah. Fine, thank you.                 Chinese Butler nods, disappears                 EXT. POND AND GARDEN \\x96 MULWRAY HOUSE \\x96 DAY                 Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table.

I... the point is, Mrs.                           Mulwray.  I m not in business to be                           loved, but I am in business, and                           believe me, whoever set up your                           husband, set me up. L.A. s a small                           town, people talk.                 He waits for a response. Then:                                       GITTES                               (continuing; uneasily)                          I m just trying to make a living,                           and I don t want to become a local                           Joke.

The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between                 them.                                       EVELYN                               (continuing; pleasantly)                          So let s just drop the whole thing.                           Sugar?

GITTES                          I don t want to drop it.                 Evelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly.                                       GITTES                          I should talk this over with your                           husband.

Look,                           Hollis seems to think you re an                           innocent man.                                       GITTES                          Well, I ve been accused of many                           things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.                 Again he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          You see, somebody went to a lot of                           trouble here, and I want to find                           out, lawsuit or no lawsuit.

She s disappeared.                           Maybe they disappeared together                           somewhere.

It couldn t be                           more personal. Is this a business or                           an obsession with you?

Whoever                           put her up to it, didn t have anything                           against me. They were out to get                           your husband. Now if I see him, I                           can help him.  Did you talk this                           morning?                 Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans.                                       EVELYN                          No. I went riding rather early.                                       GITTES                          Looks like you went quite a distance.

Anyway, you might try the Oak                           Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs.                           Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks                           around them.

OAK PASS RESERVOIR \\x96 DAY                 Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel                 up into the parched hills.                 TWO FIRE TRUCKS                 One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.                 The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there                 are people milling around. The reservoir is below.                 Gittes  car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.                                       GUARD                          Sorry, this is closed to the public,                           sir.                 Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:                                       GITTES                               (to the Guard)                          It s all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy                           Chief in the Department.                 He fishes out one of Yelburton s cards from his handkerchief                 pocket, hands it to the Guard.                                       GUARD                          Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.                 Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the                 reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.                 Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their                 backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the                 reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently                 dredging for something.                 One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes                 and is visibly shocked.

What the hell s going                           on?                 At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge                 of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns                 around. He s a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties,                 LUIS ESCOBAR.                 Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at                 seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy.                 Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.                                       ESCOBAR                          Hello, Jake.

Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case.                                       A FIREMAN                          No smoking, sir.

The other police,                 two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them.                                       ESCOBAR                          You ve done well by yourself.                                       GITTES                          I get by.

GITTES                          Congratulations.                                       ESCOBAR                          Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?                                       GITTES                          Looking for someone.                                       ESCOBAR                          Who?                                       GITTES                          Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?                                       ESCOBAR                          Oh yes.                                       GITTES                          I d like to talk to him.                                       ESCOBAR                          You re welcome to try. There he is.                 Escobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using                 poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be                 SEEN that one of them has hooked something.                 He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing                 the soaking back of a man s coat. They start to pull the                 body into the skiff.                 INT. CORONER S OFFICE \\x96 EVELYN AND ESCOBAR                 Are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet                 drawn back. Evelyn nods.                 Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet                 to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying                 to keep the corpse from hearing them.                                       ESCOBAR                          It looks like he was washed the entire                           length of the runoff channel. Could                           he swim?                                       EVELYN                          Of course.                                       ESCOBAR                          Obviously the fall must have knocked                           him out.                 Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner s assistant                 wheels the body out of the office.                                       ESCOBAR                               (continuing)                          This alleged affair he was having.

OUTSIDE THE CORONER S                 Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and                 listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the                 doorway.                 Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn t see him.                                       EVELYN                          ...Well, it didn t make him happy...

ESCOBAR                               (gesturing vaguely                                toward the door)                          Mr. Gittes.                                       EVELYN                          Well yes.                 Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a                 foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look at one another                 for a long moment.                                       EVELYN                               (her eyes on Gittes)                          But I... I... did that because I                           thought it was a nasty rumor I d put                           an end to...                 She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is right                 at her back. Gittes says nothing.                                       ESCOBAR                          And when did Mr. Gittes inform you                           that these rumors had some foundation                           in fact?                 Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn t know how to answer him.                                       GITTES                               (smoothly)                          Just before the story broke in the                           papers, Lou.                 Escobar nods. They begin to walk slowly, again have to move                 out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of                 one of the Coroner cubicles.

They go through a couple of outer                 doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer                 hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like  only in                 L.A.  and  Southern Cafeteria.                  Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking                 questions. Gittes brushes them aside.

But                           they weren t very important, just a                           bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a                           dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don t                           come out of this smelling like a                           rose, you know.

ESCOBAR                          When I do, you ll hear about it.                 Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.                 OUTSIDE MORGUE                 Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with                 Mulwray s name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an                 adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement                 that they re about to hear another chapter in the life of                 Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Another Coroner s                 assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating                 a sandwich.                 Gittes ambles into the room.                                       MORTY                               (a cigarette dangling                                out of his mouth)                          Jake, what re you doin  here?

Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS                 FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray s body. Eyes open, the face badly                 cut and bruised.                                       MORTY                          Yeah? Ain t that something? Middle                           of a drought, the water commissioner                           drowns. Only in L.A.

MORTY                          That s a long fall.                                       GITTES                          So how are you, Morty?                 Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an                 assistant.                                       MORTY                          Never better. You know me, Jake.                 As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks                 into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other                 body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.                                       GITTES                               (picking up on cough)                          Yeah, so who you got there?                 Morty pulls back the sheet.                                       MORTY                          Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to                           hang around Ferguson s Alley.                 Morty brushes some sand from the man s face, laughs.                                       MORTY                               (continuing)                          Quite a character. Lately he d been                           living in one of the downtown storm                           drains. Had a bureau dresser down                           there and everything.                 Gittes has already lost interest. He starts away.                                       GITTES                          Yeah.                                       MORTY                          Drowned, too.                 This stops Gittes.                                       GITTES                          Come again?                                       MORTY                          Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in                           the bottom of the riverbed.                                       GITTES                          The L.A.

MORTY                               (a little puzzled)                          Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what s                           wrong with that?                 Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.                                       GITTES                          It s bone dry, Morty.                                       MORTY                          It s not completely dry.                                       GITTES                          Yeah, well he ain t gonna drown in a                           damp riverbed either, I don t care                           how soused he was. That s like                           drowning in a teaspoon.                 Morty shrugs.                                       MORTY                          We got water out of him, Jake. He                           drowned.                 Gittes walks away mumbling.                                       GITTES                          Jesus, this town...                 EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD \\x96 GITTES \\x96 DAY                 He s parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on                 one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the                 riverbed below.                 FROM THE BRIDGE                 Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its                 contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying                 half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank                 of the river is a sign that proclaims  OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE                 IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000  which was used as a roof of                 sorts. Downstream, there s the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford                 seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of                 Shuhardt s home.                 Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near                 the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes                 pulls it out, swearing.                 He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears                 the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.                 Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican                 Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy                 bank.                 They look at one another a moment.

GITTES                               (continuing)                          What did you talk about, mind my                           asking?                 The shadows of the two are very long now.

GITTES                          When it comes? What d you tell him?                                       THE BOY                          Comes in different parts of the river.                           Every night a different part.                 Gittes nods. The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.                 EXT. RIVERBED \\x96 DUSK                 Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the                 storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes.

Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is                 overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.                 STILL FURTHER \\x96 NIGHT                 The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus                 are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-                shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be                 GLIMPSED.                 POV \\x96 CHAIN-LINK FENCE                 Over the road, bolted. It says  OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP                 OUT. NO TRESPASSING.                  The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel                 and down into it, making access along the channel itself                 impossible.                 Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the                 spotlight.                 A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole                 illumination.                 There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.                 Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood                 channel itself.                 ON THE OTHER SIDE                 Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage                 toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the                 reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.                 Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into                 the flood control channel, which is at this point about four                 feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men                 scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating.                 Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.                 He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is                 another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles                 Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.                 GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL \\x96 NIGHT                 Then he s inundated with a rush of water which pours over                 him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging                 into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the                 overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of                 the stream batters him and carries him with it until he s                 brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold.                 He s nearly strained through it.                 Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing                 water by means of the fence itself.                 Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and                 makes his way toward his car.                 AT GITTES  CAR                 He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.                                       GITTES                               (grumbling)                          Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.                 He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER                 MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning                 his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a                 switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes  left                 nostril.

With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade,                 laying Gittes  left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes                 screams.                 Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.                 Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood                 from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller Man                 stare at him.

EVELYN                               (coolly)                          I have?                                       GITTES                          I think so. Something besides your                           husband s death was bothering you.                           You were upset but not that upset.                                       EVELYN                          Mr. Gittes...                               (icily)                          Don t tell me how I feel.                 The drinks come. The waiter sets them down.                                       GITTES                          Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband                           dies, you drop the lawsuit like a                           hot potato, and all of it quicker                           than wind from a duck s ass. Excuse                           me. Then you ask me to lie to the                           police.                                       EVELYN                          It wasn t much of a lie.                                       GITTES                          If your husband was killed it was.                               (meaning check)                          This can look like you paid me off                           to withhold evidence.                                       EVELYN                          But he wasn t killed.                 Gittes smiles.                                       GITTES                          I think you re hiding something,                           Mrs. Mulwray.                 Evelyn remains unperturbed.                                       EVELYN                          Well, I suppose I am... actually I                           knew about the affair.                                       GITTES                          How did you find out?                                       EVELYN                          My husband.                                       GITTES                          He told you?                 Evelyn nods.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          And you weren t the slightest bit                           upset about it?                                       EVELYN                          I was grateful.                 Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.                                       GITTES                          You ll have to explain that, Mrs.                           Mulwray.                                       EVELYN                          Why?                                       GITTES                               (a flash of annoyance)                          Look, I do matrimonial work, It s my                           metiay.  When a wife tells me she s                           happy her husband is cheating on her                           it runs contrary to my experience.                 Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.                                       EVELYN                          Unless what?                                       GITTES                               (looking directly at                                her)                          She s cheating on him.                 Evelyn doesn t reply.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Were you?                 Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.                                       EVELYN                          I don t like the word  cheat.                                        GITTES                          Did you have affairs?                                       EVELYN                               (flashing)                          Mr. Gittes.                                       GITTES                          Did he know?                                       EVELYN                               (almost an outburst)                          Well I wouldn t run home and tell                           him whenever I went to bed with                           someone, if that s what you mean.                 This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated.                                       EVELYN                               (continuing; more                                calmly)                          Is there anything else you want to                           know?                                       GITTES                          Where you were when your husband                           died.                                       EVELYN                          I can t tell you.                                       GITTES                          You mean you don t know where you                           were?                                       EVELYN                          I mean I can t tell you.                                       GITTES                          You were seeing someone, too.                 Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn t deny it.                                       GITTES                          For very long?                                       EVELYN                          I don t see anyone for very long,                           Mr. Gittes.  It s difficult for me.                           Now I think you know all you need to                           about me. I didn t want publicity. I                           didn t want to go into any of this,                           then or now. Is this all?                 Gittes nods.                                       GITTES                          Oh, by the way. What s the  C  stand                           for?                 He s been fingering the envelope...                                       EVELYN                               (she stammers slightly)                          K... Cross.                                       GITTES                          That your maiden name?                                       EVELYN                          Yes... why?                                       GITTES                          No reason.                 Evelyn turns into Gittes.                                       EVELYN                          You must ve had a reason to ask me                           that.                                       GITTES                               (shrugs)                          No. I m just a snoop.                                       EVELYN                          You seem to have had a reason for                           every other question.                                       GITTES                          No, not for that one.                                       EVELYN                          I don t believe you.                 Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.                                       GITTES                               (moving in)                          Do me a favor. Sit still and act                           like I m charming.                 Evelyn involuntarily draws back.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          There s somebody here. Say something.                          Anything. Something like we re being                           intimate.                 Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle                 his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him.                                       EVELYN                               (meaning his nose)                          How did it happen?                                       GITTES                               (quietly)                          Been meaning to talk to you about                           that.                                       EVELYN                               (quietly)                          Maybe putting your nose in other                           people s business?                                       GITTES                               (quietly)                          More like other people putting their                           business in my nose.                 Evelyn actually smiles a little.                                       WOMAN S VOICE                          You son of a bitch.                 Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.                                       GITTES                          Mrs. Match. How re you?                 MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a                 glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other,                 and a menacing look in her eye.                                       MRS. MATCH                          Don t give me that, you son of a                           bitch.                                       GITTES                          Okay.                 Gittes turns back to Evelyn.                                       EVELYN                               (softly)                          Another satisfied client?                                       GITTES                          Another satisfied client s wife.                                       MRS. MATCH                          Look at me, you son of a bitch. You...                           you bastard. Are you happy, are you                           happy now?                 She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes                 covers himself. Waiters rush over.                                       MRS. MATCH                          You smug son of a bitch. My husband s                           so upset he sweats all night! How do                           you think that makes me feel?                                       GITTES                          Sweaty?                 Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him                 on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out                 from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.                 Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs                 her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried                 to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.                                       GITTES                          Let s get out of here before she                           picks up her purse.                 They rise and move toward the door.                                       EVELYN                               (quietly)                          Tough guy, huh?                 Gittes looks, sees she s kidding, and nods.                 OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT \\x96 DUSK                 Gittes  car has been brought by the parking attendant. The                 attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.                                       EVELYN                          Oh, no. I ve got my own car. The                           creamcolored Packard.

There s nothing more to                           say.                               (to attendant)                          Get my car, please.                 The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the                 open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but                 spits it out.                                       GITTES                          Okay, go home. But in case you re                           interested your husband was murdered.                           Somebody s dumping tons of water out                           of the city reservoirs when we re                           supposedly in the middle of a drought,                           he found out, and he was killed.

It looks like half                           the city is trying to cover it all                           up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs.                           Mulwray.                               (now inches from her)                          I goddam near lost my nose! And I                           like it. I like breathing through                           it. And I still think you re hiding                           something.                 Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at                 Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door                 closed.                                       EVELYN                          Mr. Gittes.                 He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn                 looking after him.                 INT.

She looks up.                 She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.                                       GITTES                          J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.                 The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner                 office.                 Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He sees                 a photographic display of  THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY                 YEARS , along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the                 man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is                 standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption                 reads  JULIAN CROSS. 1905 .                 Cross is strikingly handsome.                 Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn s                 check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down                 under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.                 The Secretary returns.

GITTES                          I take a long lunch. All day                           sometimes.                 Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one.                 She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum  The Way You                 Look Tonight,  strolling along the wall looking at more                 photographs.                 INT. MULWRAY S OFFICES                 Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along                 with Julian Cross.

Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary.

SECRETARY                          He owned it.                 Gittes is genuinely surprised at this.                                       GITTES                          He owned the water department?                                       SECRETARY                          Yes.

If you ll                           just read the display.

Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING                 SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.                 He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door.                 Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray s name on the                 outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.                 The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.

INT. DWP \\x96 YELBURTON & GITTES                 There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton s                 attitude.

Mulwray didn t want to                           build a dam and he had a reputation                           that was hard to get around, so.                            you decided to ruin it. Then he found                           out that you were dumping water every                           night. Then he was drowned.                                       YELBURTON                          Mr. Gittes! That s an outrageous                           accusation.

We re... well, we re not anxious for                           this to get around, but we have been                           diverting a little water to irrigate                           avocado and walnut groves in the                           northwest valley. As you know, the                           farmers there have no legal right to                           our water, and since the drought                           we ve had to cut them off. The city                           comes first, naturally.  But, well,                           we ve been trying to help some of                           them out, keep them from going under.

I just                           want to know who put you up to it.                            I ll give you a few days to think it                           over.

Maybe we can lay the whole thing off                           on a few big shots and you can stay                           head of the department for the next                           twenty years.

She looks up when he enters.                                       EVELYN                          What s your usual salary?                 Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight                 of her.                                       GITTES                          Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty                           for each of my operators, plus                           expenses, plus my fee if I show                           results.                 He s sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very                 shaken.                                       EVELYN                          Whoever s behind my husband s death,                           why have they gone to all this                           trouble?                                       GITTES                          Money. How they plan to make it by                           emptying the reservoirs, that I don t                           know.                                       EVELYN                          I ll pay your salary plus five                           thousand dollars if you find out                           what happened to Hollis and who is                           involved.                 Gittes buzzes Sophie.                                       GITTES                          Sophie, draw up one of our standard                           forms for Mrs. Mulwray.                               (he leans back; to                                Evelyn)                          Tell me, did you get married before                           or after Mulwray and your father                           sold the water department?                 Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Your father is Julian Cross, isn t                           he?                                       EVELYN                          Yes, of course. It was quite a while                           after. I was just out of grade school                           when they did that.                                       GITTES                          So you married your father s business                           partner?                 Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette.                                       GITTES                               (continuing; staring                                at her, points to                                the ashtray)                          You ve got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.                                       EVELYN                          Oh.                 She quickly stubs one out.                                       GITTES                          Is there something upsetting about                           my asking about your father?                                       EVELYN                          No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis                           and my fa... my father had a falling                           out...                                       GITTES                          Over the water department, or over                           you?                                       EVELYN                               (quickly)                          Not over me. Why would they have a                           falling out over me?                                       GITTES                               (noting her nervousness)                          Then it was over the water department.                                       EVELYN                          Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes                           and no.  Hollis felt the public should                           own the water but I don t think my                           father felt that way.  Actually, it                           was over the Van der Lip. The dam                           that broke.                                       GITTES                          Oh, yeah?                                       EVELYN                          Yes. He never forgave him for it.                                       GITTES                          Never forgave him for what?                                       EVELYN                          For talking him into building it, he                           never forgave my father... They                           haven t spoken to this day.                                       GITTES                               (starts a little)                          You sure shout that?                                       EVELYN                          Of course I m sure.                                       GITTES                          What about you? Do you and your father                           get along?                 Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn s reply.                 Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn.                                       GITTES                          Sign here... The other copy s for                           you.                 She signs it. When she looks back up, Gittes is staring                 intently at her.                                       EVELYN                          What are you thinking?                                       GITTES                               (picking up one of                                copies, folding it,                                putting it in his                                pocket)                          Before this I turned on the faucet,                           it came out hot and cold, I didn t                           think there was a thing to it.                 INT. SEAPLANE                 The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his                 way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which                 is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing                 gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along.                 One of the old men says something to him.                                       GITTES                               (above the engines)                          What?                                       OLD MAN                          You ll have to sit with the pilot.                 Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up \\x96                 nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese                 sandwich out of Gittes  seat.                 EXT. HARBOR - SEAPLANE                 Taxiing down the ramp into the sea. In a moment, it kicks up                 a spray of foam and takes off.                 INT. COCKPIT                 The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and                 Gittes.                 The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably                 dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane.                                       PILOT                               (above the engines)                          Well, you re not going fishing.                 Gittes shakes his head.                                       GITTES                          Not exactly.                                       PILOT                               (winks)                          But that s what you told your wife.                 The Pilot laughs raucously. Gittes laughs politely.                                       PILOT                          Lots of fellas do. Tell the little                           woman they re going on a fishing                           trip, then shack up with some little                           twist on the island... she pretty?

PILOT                          Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you,                           mister?... I ask because he doesn t                           see a whole lot of people.

She used to be some                           looker.

GITTES                          You must be thinking of a different                           daughter.                                       PILOT                          No, he s only got one, I remember                           her age, I read it in the newspapers                           when she ran away.                                       GITTES                          She ran away?                                       PILOT                          Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the                           time. Julian Cross  daughter. God                           almighty. She was a wild little thing.                 He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned                 he s said too much.                                       PILOT                               (continuing)                          Course, she settled down nicely.

She was sixteen or                           seventeen.

Rumor was she                           was knocked up and didn t even know                           who the father was. Went there to                           get rid of it.                                       GITTES                          You don t say?                                       PILOT                          Cross was looking for her all over                           the country. Offered rewards,                           everything. Felt real sorry for him,                           with all his money.                 ALBACORE CLUB \\x96 DAY                 A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building                 on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A                 motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns                 and heads in the direction of the plane.                 EXT. WINDING ROAD \\x96 RANCHO DEL CRUCE                 Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign                 with a cross painted below the name.                 The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island.                 As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a                 miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and                 canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of                 the sea.                 The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered                 around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN                 CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome                 in a rough linen shirt and jeans.

You were outside the Pig  n Whistle                           and you had one hell of an argument.                 Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.

What                           was the argument about?

HALL OF RECORDS \\x96 DAY                 Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes                 approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.                                       GITTES                          I m a little lost. Where can I find                           the plat books for the northwest                           valley?

We                           don t have Ventura County in our                           Hall of Records.                 Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.                                       GITTES                          I ll settle for L.A. County.

Gittes regards his back a                 moment, then goes to the stacks.                 THROUGH THE STACKS                 Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The                 second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment,                 then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.                 He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It s                 huge and there s a lot to go through.                 The print itself makes him squint.

In the owners  column, however there are numerous                 freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.                                       GITTES                          Hauls the huge volume back to the                           Clerk s desk.

GITTES                          How come all these new names are                           pasted into the plat book?

GITTES                          Well, then, how about a ruler?                                       CLERK                          A ruler?

The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler                 on the desk.                 Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the                 book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.                 INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY                 Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward                 the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a                 strip about two inches wide containing the owner s name and                 property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or                 coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.                 EXT. ROAD \\x96 GITTES DRIVING \\x96 DAY                 Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying                 groves, narrower roads.                 He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There                 is a  SOLD  sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks                 it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.                 OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON                 And a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this                 dried-up intersection. There is a  SOLD  sign on a drug store.                 Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.                 Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud                 of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.                 Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards                 away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid                 off it.                 Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.                 Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.

He s aware of                 Gittes watching him.                                       GITTES                          Well, you re just the man I m looking                           for.                 The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is                 immaculately dressed.                                       GITTES                          Some associates and I are thinking                           of buying property out here.

GITTES                          Yeah, I ll do that.                 GITTES DRIVING                 Is now covered with a film of dust:                 He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple of                 mailboxes.                 Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.                 As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be                 SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado                 and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures                 in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down                 to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home.                 Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.                 Gittes drives through a gate that has  NO TRESPASSING  and                  KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY  signs neatly printed on it.                 He drives down the road into the grove.                 GITTES                 Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He                 puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast                 with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their                 heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.                 Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of                 the tree he d been staring at.                 EXT. AVOCADO GROVES \\x96 DAY                 Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback                 down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-                Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does                 not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes                  lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes                 off down one of the orchard lanes.                 MOVING WITH GITTES                 The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a                 Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.                 Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the                 trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he s pursued                 by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at                 it.                 ANGLE ON GROVE                 Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes                 toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They ve spotted                 it. Clearly it s from Gittes  car.                 This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one                 on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and                 across the orchard lanes until Gittes  front tire and radiator                 are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.                 Gittes  car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese                 and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of                 the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.                 Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches                 over the back of his car, but he s pulled off it by one of                 the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle                 with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back                 with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to                 the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues                 to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.                 The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a                 mule ride up.                                       RED FACED FARMER                          All right, quit it! Quit now! Search                           the man, see if he s armed.                 Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger                 Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes                 is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his                 wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.                                       RED FACED FARMER                          I said see if he s armed, not empty                           his pockets.                                       BIG FARMER                          He ain t armed.                 Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.                                       RED FACED FARMER                          All right, mister. Who you with?                           Water department or the real estate                           office?                 Gittes  back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble                 catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in                 the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.                                       GITTES                               (to Crippled Farmer)                          Get away from me!

Who d hire you for a thing                           like that?                 Gittes reaches into his pocket. The paper s on the ground.                 He picks it up.                                       GITTES                          Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.                                       BIG FARMER                          Mulwray?

You don t know what                           you re talking about, you dumb Oakie.                 The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him                 squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he s doubled                 up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful                 aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes  head.                 Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the                 Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.

Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It s almost                 evening.                 Gittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS)                 looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his                 head, It obviously hurts him.                 EXT.

(indicating his                                disheveled appearance)                          I just can t handle him anymore, can                           I, sweetheart?                 Evelyn shakes her head.                                       PALMER                          Oh my goodness.                                       GITTES                               (hastily)                          Nothing to do with Dad. It s me,                           actually.                                       EVELYN                          They just don t get along very well.                           Dad s a lamb with anyone else.                                       PALMER                               (not so sure)                          Oh, well, I don t know.                                       GITTES                          Naturally, I want the best for him,                           money is no object.                                       PALMER                          Perhaps if we could meet your father.                                       GITTES                          There s just one question.                                       PALMER                          Of course.                                       GITTES                          Do you accept anyone of the Jewish                           persuasion?                 Evelyn can t quite conceal her surprise at the question.                                       PALMER                               (very embarrassed)                          I m sorry. We don t.                                       GITTES                               (smoothly)                          Don t be sorry, neither does Dad.                           Wanted to make sure though, didn t                           we, honey?                 Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled. She manages                 to nod.                                       GITTES                          Just to be certain, I wonder if you                           could show us a list of your patients?                                       PALMER                               (polite but pointed)                          We don t reveal the names of our                           guests as a matter of policy. I know                           you d appreciate that if your father                           came to live with us.                 Gittes locks eyes with Palmer.                                       GITTES                               (confidentially)                          That s exactly what we wanted to                           hear.                                       PALMER                          Oh, good.                                       GITTES                          I wonder, is it too late for us to                           have a look around?                                       PALMER                          I don t think so. Be happy to show                           you.                                       GITTES                          Would you mind if we took a stroll                           on our own?                                       PALMER                          Just, if you will, confine yourself                           to the main building. It s nearly                           bedtime.                                       GITTES                          We understand, c mon, sweetheart.                 He takes Evelyn.                 INT. PARLOR \\x96 EVELYN                 Looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily                 octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one wing,                 the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one                 elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.                 In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a                 quilt.                 Gittes grabs Evelyn s hand.                                       GITTES                               (quietly)                          They re all here. Every goddam name.                 Gittes points to the wall. It says  ACTIVITIES BOARD . There                 are titles.  LAWN BOWLING .  BRIDGE .  FISHING .  CROQUET .                 Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain                 activities, for certain days.                 After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.                                       GITTES                               (continuing; indicating                                the ancients around                                them)                          You re looking at the owners of a                           50,000 acre empire.

GITTES                          They may not know it but they are.                 Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the                 quilt.                                       GITTES                          Hello, girls.                 Two of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy herself                 with her quilt, off by herself.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Which one of you is Emma Dill?                 Two of them say  she is,  and point in different directions.                 The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her                 knitting. Gittes approaches her.                                       GITTES                          Are you Emma?                 Some old voice is singing softly,  Don t Sit Under the Apple                 Tree.                                        EMMA                          Yes.                                       GITTES                          I ve been wanting to meet you.                                       EMMA                          Why?                                       GITTES                          Did you know that you re a very                           wealthy woman?                                       EMMA                               (stitching, smiles)                          I m not.                                       GITTES                          Well you own a lot of land.                                       EMMA                          Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my                           late husband owned a good deal of                           beach property in Long Beach, but we                           lost it.                 Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among                 the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it.                                       GITTES                          That s just lovely.                                       EMMA                          Thank you...                 He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish,                 comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C.                                       GITTES                               (indicating tail)                          Where did you get this material?                                       EMMA                               (what it sounds like)                          The apple core club.                                       GITTES                          The apple core?                                       EMMA                          No. The albacore. It s a fish. My                           grandson s a member and they take                           very nice care of us.                                       GITTES                          How do they do that?                                       EMMA                          Give us things. Not just some old                           flag like this, but \\x96-                                       GITTES                               (kneeling)                          But what?                                       PALMER S VOICE                          We re a sort of unofficial charity                           of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you                           care to come this way? Someone wants                           to see you.                 Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking                 taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures                 as if there s someone behind Palmer.                 Gittes rises.                                       GITTES                          See you later, Emma.                 He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front.                 AT THE ENTRANCE HALL \\x96 MULVIHILL                 Is waiting. He s got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to                 Gittes.                 The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over                 everyone.                                       MULVIHILL                          Come on I want you to meet somebody,                           Gittes.                                       GITTES                               (glancing from Palmer                                to Mulvihill)                          Can we leave the lady out of this?                                       MULVIHILL                               (a little uncertain)                          Yeah, why not?                                       GITTES                          Okay, I d like to walk her to her                           car.                                       EVELYN                          I ll stay.                                       GITTES                               (taking her by the                                arm)                          Get in the car.                                       MULVIHILL                          I ll see she makes it.                 Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake                 of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back                 to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill s                 jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket                 covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating                 him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly                 pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red                 and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.                 Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill s                 gun has clattered to the floor.                                       GITTES                               (as Mulvihill hits                                the floor, to Evelyn)                          What are you waiting for? Get in the                           car!                 Evelyn goes.                 Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the                 gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand                 and kicks it.                 It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the                 wall.                 Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back                 to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.                 Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience                 of ancients behind him.                 OUTSIDE                 As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming                 toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous,                 jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.                 Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward                 him.                 Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.                 Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly                 behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn s car is headed across                 the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it                 gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety.                 The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.

You don t know                           how crazy.                                       GITTES                          Give me an example.

GITTES                          That s what your father said. You re                           telling me he s in back of this whole                           thing?

I need                           you here.                 She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes                 stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around,                 tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on.                 Then hurries out of the bedroom.                 EXT. MULWRAY HOME \\x96 GITTES                 Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two                 cars there.                 Mulwray s Buick and Evelyn s Packard.                 Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger s door.                 INT. BUICK - GITTES                 Checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple of                 wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems                 satisfied.                 Slides out across the seat, slams the door.                 EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY \\x96 NIGHT                 Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the                 driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the heel                 of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the                 car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls                 the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light                 beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and                 hurries back toward the house.                 ONE RED AND ONE WHITE TAILLIGHT \\x96 MOVING \\x96 NIGHT                 Evelyn s car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard,                 the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.                 GITTES DRIVING \\x96 NIGHT                 Behind the wheel of Mulwray s car, keeping a healthy distance                 from Evelyn in front of him.                 EVELYN S PACKARD                 Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She gets out,                 looks up and down the street. There is nothing. She hurries                 on up the walkway to the front door.                 DOWN THE STREET \\x96 GITTES IN BUICK                 Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a                 few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn s.                 Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The                 curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on                 the side of the house.                 He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.                 THROUGH THE WINDOW                 Gittes sees Evelyn s Oriental servant rush through the living                 room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back                 through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and                 pitcher on it.                 GITTES                 Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and                 a short picket fence.                 He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series                 of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades                 on them.                 He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking                 alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the                 windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not                 completely drawn.                 There s an inch or so of space at the bottom.                 THROUGH THE WINDOW                 Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and                 forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone                 rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure                 is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes                 INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen                 with Hollis Mulwray.                 Mulwray s girlfriend. She s looking up to Evelyn, speaking                 in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is                 bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.                 Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some                 pills.                 The girl reluctantly does.                 GITTES                 Continues to watch.

GITTES                          Okay, give me the keys.                                       EVELYN                               (stunned, furious)                          You bastard.                                       GITTES                          It s either that or you drive to the                           police yourself.                                       EVELYN                          The police?                                       GITTES                          C mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You ve got your                           husband s girlfriend tied up in there!                                       EVELYN                          She s not tied up!                                       GITTES                          You know what I mean. You re keeping                           her there against her will.                                       EVELYN                          I am not!                                       GITTES                          Then let s go talk to her.                 Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm,                 nearly screaming:                                       EVELYN                          No!                 Her intensity actually rips Gittes  already partially torn                 jacket.                 He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming                 effect on both of them.                                       EVELYN                               (continuing)                          She s too upset.                                       GITTES                          What about?                                       EVELYN                          Hollis  death. I tried to keep it                           from her, I didn t want her upset                           before I could make plans for her to                           leave.                                       GITTES                          You mean she just found out?                                       EVELYN                          Yes.

EVELYN                          What does it look like?                                       GITTES                          Like she knows about Hollis  death.                           Like she knows more than you want                           her to tell.                                       EVELYN                          You re insane.

EVELYN                          You won t go to the police if I tell                           you?                                       GITTES                          I will if you don t.                 A long pause. Evelyn s head sinks onto the steering wheel,                 her hair covering her face.                                       EVELYN                          She s my sister.                 Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the                 kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes                 puts an arm on her shoulder.                                       GITTES                          Take it easy... If it s your sister                           it s your sister... why all the                           secrecy?                 She lifts her head and looks up at him. He s genuinely                 puzzled.                                       EVELYN                               (really upset)                          I can t...                                       GITTES                          Because of Hollis? Because she was                           seeing your husband? Was that it?                           Jesus Christ, say something. Was                           that it?                 She nods. Gittes sighs.                                       EVELYN                               (finally)                          I would never ever have harmed Hollis.                           I loved him more than my own family.                           He was the most gentle, decent man                           imaginable... and he put up with                           more from me than you ll ever know...                           I just wanted him to be happy...                 She begins to cry softly.                                       GITTES                               (after a moment)                          I took your husband s Buick...

There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to                 Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.                                       GITTES                               (finally)                          Yeah, well... I m very tired, Mrs.                           Mulwray. Good night.

She s waiting                           for you.                 Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.                 EXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD \\x96 HOLLYWOOD HILLS \\x96 EARLY MORNING                 Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow                 walkway and sickly green stucco.                 EXT. IDA SESSIONS  APARTMENT \\x96 DAY                 Gittes at the front door. It s slightly ajar. He knocks.                 Nothing. He opens it and enters.                 INT. LIVING ROOM                 Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust                 particles in the shafts of light. It s still and empty. Gittes                 sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone                 table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets                 closer he can see it s a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside                 the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum.                 Gittes walks on into the kitchen.                 INT. KITCHEN                 Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying                 on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a                 broken bag.                 Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream                 of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth.                 She s recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.                 Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes                 for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen                 counter.                 Wallet with a few bills in it, driver s license with her                 name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns,                 carefully replaces the items in the purse.                 He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire,                 which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves                 across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.                 INT. BATHROOM                 Gittes enters and turns on the light.                                       ESCOBAR                          Find anything interesting, Gittes?                 Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom                 by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A                 THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom.                 Gittes looks at the two, doesn t reply.                                       ESCOBAR                          What are you doing here?                                       GITTES                          Didn t you call?

GITTES                          I don t.

KITCHEN                 Escobar points to the number  MU 7279  on the side of one of                 the kitchen cabinets.                                       ESCOBAR                          Isn t that your number?                                       GITTES                          Is it? I forget. I don t call myself                           that often.                                       ESCOBAR                          Just to be on the safe side, we had                           Loach here give you a ring.                 He indicates one of his assistants.                                       ESCOBAR S ASSISTANT                               (a slight sneer)                          What happened to your nose, Gittes?                           Somebody slam a bedroom window on                           it?                                       GITTES                               (right back, smiling)                          Nope, your wife got excited, crossed                           her legs a little too quick. You                           understand, pal.                 The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for                 him.                 Escobar steps between the two.                                       ESCOBAR                               (to other Assistant)                          Loach.                               (Escobar pulls out a                                drawer)                          How about these? Look familiar?                 In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in                 the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda.                                       GITTES                               (no point in denying                                it)                          Yeah, I took  em. So what?                                       ESCOBAR                          How did she...                               (meaning the corpse)                          ...happen to have them?                 Gittes takes a deep breath.                                       GITTES                          Either you tell me or I guess  cause                           I don t have the answer.                 Escobar nods.                                       ESCOBAR                          You really think I m stupid, don t                           you, Gittes?                                       GITTES                          I don t think about it one way or                           the other. But if you want, give me                           a day or two, and I ll get back to                           you. Now I d like to go home.                                       ESCOBAR                          I want the rest of the pictures.                                       GITTES                          What pictures?                                       ESCOBAR                               (meaning the corpse)                          This broad hired you, Gittes, not                           Evelyn Mulwray.                                       GITTES                          Yeah?                                       ESCOBAR                          Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down                           Mulwray, she hired you, and that s                           how you happen to know Mulwray was                           murdered.                                       GITTES                          I heard it was an accident.                                       ESCOBAR                          C mon, you think you re dealing with                           a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had                           salt water in his goddam lungs! Now                           how did he get that... in a fresh                           water reservoir?                 Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains                 nonplussed.                                       ESCOBAR                          You were following him night and                           day. You saw who killed him. You                           even took pictures of it. It was                           Evelyn Mulwray. She s been paying                           you off like a slot machine ever                           since her husband died.                                       GITTES                               (smiling)                          You accusing me of extortion?                                       ESCOBAR                          Absolutely.                                       GITTES                          I don t think I need a day or two.                           You re even dumber than you think I                           think you are. Not only that, I d                           never extort a nickel out of my worst                           enemy, that s where I draw the line,                           Escobar.                                       ESCOBAR                          Yeah, I once knew a whore who for                           enough money would piss in a                           customer s face, but she d never                           shit on his chest. That s where she                           drew the line.                                       GITTES                               (smiling)                          Well, I hope she wasn t too much of                           a disappointment to you, Lou.                 Escobar manages a thin smile.                                       ESCOBAR                          I want those photographs, Gittes.                           We re talking about accessory after                           the fact, conspiracy, and extortion.                           Minimum.                                       GITTES                          Why do you think Mulwray s body was                           moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray                           knocked off her husband in the ocean                           and thought it would look like more                           of an accident if she hauled him up                           to the Oak Pass Reservoir?                 This is a little telling.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Mulwray was murdered and moved because                           somebody didn t want his body found                           in the ocean.                                       ESCOBAR                          And why s that?                                       GITTES                          He found out somebody was dumping                           water there. That s what they were                           trying to cover up by moving him.                 This stops Escobar. He s dumbfounded by it.                                       ESCOBAR                          What are you talking about?                                       GITTES                          C mon I ll show you.

You re                           in charge.                 The men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods.

GITTES                               (meaning Escobar)                          Because he just made lieutenant, and                           he wants to hang onto his little                           gold bar.

MULWRAY HOME \\x96 DAY                 Gittes in Mulwray s Buick whips into the driveway. He looks                 in the garage. Evelyn s car is gone. Only the Gardener s                 truck is there.                 Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He                 rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries                 it. It s locked.                 He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case,                 takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the                 lock.                 The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at                 Gittes.                                       GITTES                          Where s Mrs. Mulwray?                                       MAID                          No esta.                 Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room                 where luggage is packed and neatly piled.                 The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over                 the furniture.                                       GITTES                               (indicating luggage)                          Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...                               (no answer)                          on a trip?... vacation?...                                       MAID                          No esta in casa.                 Gittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to                 the veranda.                 EXT. MULWRAY VERANDA \\x96 GITTES                 Is unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He                 wanders a few yards in that direction.                 GARDENER                 Spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles.                 GITTES                 In turn, nods, smiles.                                       GITTES                          Bad for glass.                 GARDENER                 Breaks into a big grin. Nods again.                                       GARDENER                          Oh yes, bad for glass.                 He points to the newly mown lawn.

GITTES                          Can t quite believe what he s heard,                                       GITTES                          Salt water?                 The Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond.                                       GARDENER                          Velly velly bad.                 Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the                 edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he d                 looked closely, a starfish.                 CLOSE STARFISH                 It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just                 beginning to grow back.                 GITTES                 Touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots                 something glinting in the bottom of the pond.                                       GITTES                          What s that... down there?                 The Gardener peers into the pond.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          ...there.                 The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the                 pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching                 the water.                 He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an                 animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and                 holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking                 through the frame where one lens is shattered.                 The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses.                 They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.                 INT. MULWRAY HOME                 Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table,                 lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.                 The Maid hovers around over Gittes  shoulder, uneasily                 watching him.

He hurries to the front                 door, pounds on it.                 The Chinese servant answers the door.

GITTES                          That s good. Now what s her name?                                       EVELYN                          Katherine.                                       GITTES                          Katherine?... Katherine who?                                       EVELYN                          She s my daughter.                 Gittes stares at her. He s been charged with anger and when                 Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face.                 Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from                 her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.                                       GITTES                          I said the truth!                                       EVELYN                          She s my sister.                 Gittes slaps her again.                                       EVELYN                          She s my daughter.                 Gittes slaps her again.                                       EVELYN                          My sister.                 He hits her again.                                       EVELYN                          My daughter, my sister.                 He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase                 which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing.                                       GITTES                          I said I want the truth.                                       EVELYN                               (almost screaming it)                          She s my sister and my daughter!                 Kyo comes running down the stairs.                                       EVELYN                               (continuing; in Chinese)                          For God s sake, Kyo, keep her                           upstairs, go back!                 Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes                 back upstairs.                                       EVELYN                          My father and I, understand, or is                           it too tough for you?                 Gittes doesn t answer.                                       EVELYN                          ...he had a breakdown... the dam                           broke... my mother died... he became                           a little boy... I was fifteen...                           he d ask me what to eat for breakfast,                           what clothes to wear!...

She nods.                                       EVELYN                          Hollis came and took... care of me...                           after she was born... he said... he                           took care of her... I couldn t see                           her... I wanted to but I couldn t...

I don t want her to know...                                       GITTES                          ...so that s why you hate him...                 Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes.                                       EVELYN                          No... for turning his back on me                           after it happened! He couldn t face                           it...                               (weeping)                          I hate him.                 Gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie.                                       GITTES                          Yeah... where are you taking her                           now?                                       EVELYN                          Back to Mexico.                                       GITTES                          You can t go by train. Escobar ll be                           looking for you everywhere.                                       EVELYN                          How about a plane?                                       GITTES                          That s worse... Just get out of here.                           Walk out, leave everything.                                       EVELYN                          I have to go home and get my things.                                       GITTES                          I ll take care of it.                                       EVELYN                          Where can we go?                                       GITTES                          ...where does Kyo live?                                       EVELYN                          With us.                                       GITTES                          On his day off. Get the exact address.                                       EVELYN                          Okay...                 She stops suddenly.                                       EVELYN                          Those didn t belong to Hollis.                 For a moment Gittes doesn t know what she s talking about.                 Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his                 handkerchief.                                       GITTES                          How do you know?                                       EVELYN                          He didn t wear bifocals.                 Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is                 momentarily lost in them.                 EVELYN                 From the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine.                                       EVELYN                          Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart.

GITTES                          Rises a little shakily from the arm                           of the sofa.                                       GITTES                          Hello.                 With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn                 hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges.                                       EVELYN                               (calling down)                          He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you                           know where that is?                 REACTION \\x96 GITTES                 He nods slowly.                                       GITTES                          Sure. It s Chinatown.

No one is                 there.                                       GITTES                               (not even bothering                                to look around the                                sides)                          Come on in, Lou.

SAN PEDRO \\x96 29TH STREET \\x96 DAY                 A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar s unmarked                 car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched                 on the steep hillside.                                       ESCOBAR                          That s it?                                       GITTES                          Yeah.

Escobar waits.                                       GITTES                               (continuing)                          Let me bring her down myself... she s                           not armed or nothing... she won t be                           any problem...

Escobar shakes his head. For a moment it looks like it means                 no.                                       ESCOBAR                          You never learn, do you, Gittes?                                       GITTES                               (a little chagrined)                          I guess not.                                       ESCOBAR                          Give you three minutes.                                       GITTES                          Gee, thanks, Lou.                 Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the                 stairs. He looks back down at Escobar. Gittes rings the bell.                 He waits. It opens.

GITTES                               (with sarcasm)                          Who do you blame for that? Her?                 Cross makes a funny little cock of his head.                                       CROSS                          I don t blame myself. You see, Mr.                           Gittes, most people never have to                           face the fact that at the right time                           and right place, they re capable of                           anything. Take those glasses from                           him, will you, Claude?                 Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses.                 Gittes doesn t move.                                       CROSS                          It s not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It s                           really not worth it.                 Gittes hands over the glasses.                                       CROSS                          Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn                           allows me to see her, or I m not                           averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If                           I have to buy the jail. Hollis and                           Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen                           years. It s been too long, I m too                           old.                 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET \\x96 NIGHT                 The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese                 in traditional dress.                 GITTES                 Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly                 lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near                 a laundry truck.                 Gittes sees them, keeps driving.                                       CROSS                               (suddenly)                          Stop the car. Stop the car!                 Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The                 car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.                 EXT. STREET \\x96 CROSS                 Leaps out of the car shouting:                                       CROSS                          Katherine! Katherine! Wait!                 Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at                 Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and                 the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd                 scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit                 Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the                 pavement.                 CURLY                 Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.                                       GITTES                          No, Curly, get  em out of here! Get                            em out of here!                 He bites Mulvihill s hand and furiously pounds it into the                 sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it                 but someone else has it.                 EVELYN                 Holds the gun. She s shaking but apparently in control of                 herself.                 GITTES                 Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.                                       EVELYN                          No, don t help him. Don t do anything.                 Mulvihill doesn t move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds                 the revolver on him.                                       EVELYN                          She s gone. It s no good.                                       CROSS                          Where?                                       GITTES                               (moving to Evelyn)                          Let me handle that.                                       EVELYN                               (to Gittes)                          I m all right.                                       GITTES                               (she s not)                          Sure, but I d like to handle it.                 Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.                                       CROSS                          You re going to have to kill me,                           Evelyn. Either that or tell me where                           she is.                 Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the                 pistol.                                       CROSS                          How many years have I got?... she s                           mine too.                                       EVELYN                          She s never going to know that.                 There s the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes                 grabs Cross.                 Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees                 them.                                       GITTES                          Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.                               (to Walsh)                          Jesus Christ, I didn t tell you to                           bring the police department with                           you.                                       WALSH                          Jake, it s Chinatown. They re all                           over the place. You oughta know                           better.                                       GITTES                               (to Walsh, meaning                                Cross)                          Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart,                           will you?                               (moving to Evelyn)                          Take Duffy s car. Curly s boat s in                           Pedro, near the Starkist cannery.                           It s the Evening Star. He ll be                           waiting. I ll take care of this.                 She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and he looks                 at her.                 She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it.                                       ESCOBAR                          Mrs. Mulwray, you don t want to run                           around like that.                                       GITTES                          Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don t know                           what s going on. Let her go. I ll                           explain it later.                                       ESCOBAR                          Mrs. Mulwray, it s a very serious                           offense pointing that at an officer                           of the law. It s a felony.                                       GITTES                          Let her go. She didn t kill anybody.                                       ESCOBAR                               (starting toward her)                          I m sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.                                       GITTES                          Lou, she will kill you. Let her go                           for now. You don t know.                                       ESCOBAR                          Gittes, stay outta this.                 Escobar continues to move toward her. Gittes grabs him.                                       GITTES                               (to Evelyn)                          Now take off.                 Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets Escobar                 go.                                       ESCOBAR                          I ll just have her followed. She s                           not going anywhere.                 There s a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the                 block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his                 double-parked car.                 Duffy s sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street.                 It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a                 halt.                 Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out,                 inert.                 Blood is pouring from her right eye.                                       GITTES                               (yelling)                          No!                 He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up. Cross                 himself elbows through.                                       GITTES                          Where is he? I ll kill him, I ll                           kill the son of a bitch.                 Several officers contain Gittes.                                       GITTES                               (to Escobar)                          Who is he, get his name? I ll kill                           him.                                       ESCOBAR                               (badly shaken)                          Take it easy, take it easy, it was                           an accident.                                       GITTES                          An accident?                 Gittes looks down. What he sees horrifies him. Cross is on                 the ground, holding Evelyn s body, crying.                                       GITTES                          Get him away from her. He s                           responsible for everything. Get him                           away from her!                                       ESCOBAR                               (stunned)                          Jake, you re very disturbed. You re                           crazy. That s her father.                 Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd.                                       ESCOBAR                               (to them)                          You wanna do your partner the biggest                           favor of his life? Take him home.                           Just get him the hell out of here!                 Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh,                 literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying                 to shake free.                 Through the crowd noises, Walsh can be heard saying,  Forget                 it, Jake. It s Chinatown.                                            THE END  ',\n",

We re CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:             HAZEL (V.O.)            You have a choice in this world, I            believe, about how to tell sad            stories.            CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:           - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS  GUS            WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.           [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]             HAZEL (V.O.)            On the one hand, you can sugar coat            - the way they do in movies and            romance novels.            -  Perfect  Hazel and  Perfect  Gus sit on a BENCH           overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.           She rests her head on his shoulder.             HAZEL (V.O.)            Where villains are vanquished            and... heroes are born and...           -  Perfect  Hazel and  Perfect  Gus kiss in a dark room.             HAZEL (V.O.)            ... beautiful people learn            beautiful lessons...            -  Perfect  Hazel and  Perfect  Gus fall onto a bed together.           They look deep into one another s eyes.             HAZEL (V.O.)            ... and nothing is too messed up            that can t be fixed with an apology            and a Peter Gabriel song.            BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were           those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.             HAZEL (V.O.)            I like that way as much as the next            girl, believe me. It s just not the            truth.            Hazel closes her eyes.             HAZEL (V.O.)            This is the truth.           And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:             HAZEL (V.O.)            Sorry.             FADE IN ON:             2.                                       INT DOCTOR S OFFICE - DAY           The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.             HAZEL (V.O.)            Late in the Winter of my 17th            year...            There are, however, some key and obvious differences.           First, you ll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which           help her to breathe.            Second, you ll notice her hair - which we couldn t see in the           grass. It s much shorter than the  Perfect  version, the           result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few           years before.             HAZEL (V.O.)            ... my mother decided I was            depressed.                            HAZEL            I m not depressed.            Hazel s legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her           mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains           to the DOCTOR:                            FRANNIE            ... she eats like a bird. She            barely leaves the house,                            HAZEL            I m not depressed.                            FRANNIE            ... she reads the same book over            and over...                            DOCTOR            She s depressed.                            HAZEL            I m not depressed!            Off her look, CUT TO:           QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:                            HAZEL (V.O.)            The booklets and web sites always            list depression as a side effect of            cancer...            - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,           laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here s Hazel.           With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.             3.                                                       HAZEL (V.O.)            Depression s not a side effect of            cancer...            - HAZEL S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the           middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A           glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.           Hazel eyes them with indifference.                            HAZEL (V.O.)            ... it s a side effect of dying.            - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily           underlined copy of a novel ( An Imperial Affliction  by Peter           Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of           delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his           shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat           - goes back to the book.                            HAZEL (V.O.)            Which is what was happening to me.

Hazel continues to           dangle her feet.                            FRANNIE            ... some days she won t even get            out of bed.           The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.                            DOCTOR            I may switch you to Zoloft. Or            Lexapro. And twice a day instead of            once.                            HAZEL            Why stop there?                            DOCTOR            Hmm?                            HAZEL            Keep `em coming. I can take it. I m            like the Keith Richards of cancer            kids.           The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.                            DOCTOR            Have you been going to that Support            Group I suggested?           Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.             4.                                                       FRANNIE            She s gone a few times.

Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she s lost this battle.                            DOCTOR            Who knows? You might even find            it... enlightening.

PATRICK            ... we are gathered here today -            literally - in the heart of Jesus.           ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest           thing she could be doing right now.                            PATRICK            Who would like to share their story            with the group?

It started            a few years ago, when I was...           As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:             HAZEL (V.O.)            I ll spare you the gory details of            Patrick s ball cancer. Basically,            they found it in his nuts, cut most            of it out, he almost died, but he            didn t die, and now here he is -            divorced, friendless, addicted to            video games, exploiting his            cancertastic past in the heart of            Jesus -  literally  - to show us            that one day - if we re lucky - we            could be just like him.           They all say:             ALL IN UNISON             We re here for you Patrick.            Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with           her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye           patch, ISAAC. He s also shaking his head.                            PATRICK            Who else would like to share?                            (NO RESPONSE)            Hazel?           Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she           stands, sighs...                            HAZEL            I m, uh, Hazel. 16.                            (BEAT)            Thyroid originally but with quite            the impressive satellite colony in            my lungs.           Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.                            PATRICK            And how are you doing Hazel?           Hazel has no idea how to answer that.             HAZEL (V.O.)            You mean besides the terminal            cancer?             6.                                      But that s not what she says. She says:                            HAZEL            Alright? I guess...?           Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.             ALL IN UNISON             We re here for you Hazel.            Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.                            PATRICK            Maybe now I ll play a song...                                       EXT CHURCH - LATER           Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a           book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door           open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks           at her like  well, was it great?  Hazel just exhales and gets           in the car.

Frannie and Hazel s dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to           stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but           trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:                            FRANNIE            It s Friday night.                            HAZEL            Hmm?

Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac s saying but it s           difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy s gaze on her.                            ISAAC            Not that I m complaining or            anything. I know a lot of you have            it way worse but, still, I mean,            you know, being blind s gonna            suck...           As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn t look away from           Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation           irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,           meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.           A staring contest.                            ISAAC            ...My girlfriend helps. And friends            like Augustus here...           Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -           AUGUSTUS. He still doesn t look away from Hazel.                            ISAAC            So... yeah. That s what s up.             ALL IN UNISON             We re here for you Isaac.            The staring contest continues another few beats until:                            PATRICK            And does your friend want to speak?           This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,           he s lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up           as if to say  Victory is mine!  He smiles back at her, the           most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.                            GUS            Hi. I m Augustus Waters. 17. Had a            touch of osteosarcoma bout a year            and a half ago - lost this baby as            a result...             11.                                      Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.                            GUS            But really I m just here at Isaac s            request.                            PATRICK            And how are you feeling Augustus?                            GUS            Me? Oh I m grand. I m on a roller            coaster that only goes up, my            friend.           Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops           smiling and looks away.                            PATRICK            Perhaps you d like to share your            fears with the group, Augustus.                            GUS            My fears?           Gus thinks about this.                            GUS            Oblivion.                            PATRICK            Oblivion?           ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.                            GUS            Yeah, see... I intend to live an            extraordinary life. To be            remembered. If I m scared of            anything it s... not doing that.           Patrick doesn t quite have the tools to deal with that.                            PATRICK            Would, uh, anyone like to speak to            that?           And Hazel s hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.                            PATRICK            Hazel! That s unexpected.           Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus           watches her, waits for it.                            HAZEL            I just wanna say... there will come            a time when, you know, all of us            are dead.           Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.             12.                                                       HAZEL            It might be tomorrow. Might be a            million years from now but... it s            gonna happen. And when it does,            enough generations will come and            go, there ll be no one left to            remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or            Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,            right?           The look on Gus s face is unreadable.                            HAZEL            Oblivion s inevitable. And if that            scares you, well, I suggest you            ignore it. God knows it s what            everyone else does.           A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus s face,           not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:                                       EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER           Hazel waits for her Mom s car to appear.           Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a           redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there s no tomorrow           against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between           kisses, we can hear:                            ISAAC MONICA           Always. Always.                                      And Hazel hears:                            GUS            Literally.           Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing           right next to her.                            GUS            I thought we were in a church            basement but apparently we were            literally in the heart of Jesus.           Hazel smiles.                            HAZEL            Someone should probably tell him,            don t you think? Jesus? Seems kinda            dangerous keeping all these kids            with cancer in your heart.           Gus laughs.                            GUS            What s your name?             13.                                                       HAZEL            Hazel.                            GUS            No your full name?                            HAZEL                            (CONFUSED)            Hazel Grace Lancaster.           Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.                            HAZEL            What?                            GUS            I didn t say anything.                            HAZEL            Why are you looking at me like            that?                            GUS            Because you re beautiful.           Hazel is taken aback. No one s ever said that to her before.                            GUS            I enjoy looking at beautiful people            and I decided a while back not to            deny myself the simpler pleasures            of existence. Particularly given            that, as you so astutely pointed            out, we re all gonna die pretty            soon.                            HAZEL                            (BEAT)            I m not beaut --           A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.                            YOUNG GIRL            Hey Gus.                            GUS            Hey Alisa.           Hazel isn t surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course           they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at           each other. She hears:                                                       ISAAC MONICA           Always. Always.                                                       HAZEL            What s with the  always?              14.                                                       GUS             Always  is their thing. They ll             always  love each other and            whatnot. Must have texted  always             to each other at least four million            times this year.           They continue to watch the show. It s pretty gross. Isaac           squeezes Monica s breast like a clown horn.                            HAZEL            He s gotta be hurting her boob.                            GUS            Let s watch a movie.           Hazel is again surprised.                            HAZEL            Oh. Um. Uh...            (yes!)            Sure. Yeah. I m... pretty free this                            WEEK--                            GUS            No I mean now.                            HAZEL            What?                            GUS            Hmm?                            HAZEL            What do you mean  now?                             GUS            I ve got a car.           He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.                            HAZEL            You could be an axe murderer.                            GUS            There is that possibility.                            (BEAT)            Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.           As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and           pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in           disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between           his lips.                            HAZEL            Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You re            kidding right?            (off his look)            You just ruined the whole thing!             15.                                                       GUS            Whole thing?                            HAZEL            What, you think that s cool? Oh you            idiot! There s always a hamartia,            isn t there? And yours is - even            though you had FREAKING CANCER you            give money to a corporation for the            chance to acquire EVEN MORE            CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so            well.           As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on           his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.                            HAZEL            Let me tell you... not being able            to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.                            GUS            Hamartia?           Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.                            HAZEL            A fatal flaw.           Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still           etched on his face.                            GUS            They don t hurt you unless you            light them.                            HAZEL            Sorry?                            GUS            I ve never lit one.           Hazel turns back to him.                            GUS            It s a metaphor. See? You put the            thing that kills you between your            teeth. But you don t give it the            power to do the killing.           Hazel is floored. And impressed.                            HAZEL            Metaphor.           Gus holds her gaze. And it s at this point Frannie pulls up.                            FRANNIE            Hi sweetheart. Ready for some             Model?              16.                                      Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as           anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.                            HAZEL            Can t tonight.            (off her confused look)            I ve made plans with Augustus            Waters.           And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with           the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or           awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:                                       INT GUS S CAR - LATER           Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world s worst           driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the           seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck           snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.                            GUS            I failed the test a couple times.                            HAZEL            You don t say.                            GUS            Most amputees can drive with no            problem but... yeah. Not me.                            HAZEL            I m surprised you have a license.                            GUS            Tell me about it!           Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.                            GUS            The fourth time I took the test...            it was going about how this is            going... and when it was over, the            instructor looks at me and goes,             your driving, while unpleasant...            is not technically unsafe.                             HAZEL            Aha. Cancer perk.                            GUS            Total cancer perk.           A few beats of silence.                            GUS            So what happened to you?           Hazel takes a deep breath. She s told this story before but           somehow this seems different.             17.                                                       HAZEL            I was 13 when they found it.           And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:                                       INT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK           13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy.             HAZEL (V.O.)

He s not pleased.             HAZEL (V.O.)            And then stopped working.           - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.           Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.             HAZEL (V.O.)            And then my lungs started filling            up with water.           - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.             HAZEL (V.O.)            That should have been the end.             18.                                                       FRANNIE            (through the tears)            Are you ready, sweetie?           14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can t keep it together any           longer. He completely breaks down.

The antibiotics kicked in. They            drained the fluid from my lungs.            And in time I got better. Stronger.

HAZEL (V.O.)            It s called Phalanxifor. Didn t            work in over 70 percent of patients            but, for some reason...           The Radiologist looks surprised.             HAZEL (V.O.)            ...it worked in me. They called it             The Miracle.            And finally, BACK TO:                                       INT GUS S CAR - SAME           Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was           impressed with her before. He s totally dazzled now.                            HAZEL            Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly            grown since...                            (MORE)             19.                            HAZEL (CONT D)            Of course my lungs still suck but,            theoretically, they could continue            to suck in just this way for, I            dunno, a while maybe.                            GUS            Wow.                            HAZEL            Yeah.                            GUS            So are you back in school or...?

Well that explains            the aura of sophistication...           He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm           playfully. They re easing into each other.           Eventually Gus s car pulls into his driveway.                            GUS            We re here.           He s as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:                                       EXT/INT GUS S HOUSE - SAME           Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of           engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like  Home is           Where the Heart Is  and  True Love is Born from Hard Times.            Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.                            GUS            My parents call them             encouragements.             (rolling his eyes)            Don t ask.           Gus s MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.                            GUS            Hey guys.                            GUS S MOM            Augustus, hi. New friend?             20.                                      Gus s parents don t seem surprised to see Gus with some           random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.                            GUS            This is Hazel Grace.                            HAZEL            It s just... Hazel.

As she s pulled:                            HAZEL            Nice to meet you!           They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier           time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and           weak lungs.           Eventually they arrive at Gus s basement bedroom. There s a           TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole           host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school           trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.                            GUS            I used to play.                            HAZEL            Must have been pretty good.                            GUS            These are mine. And these. The rest            of it s just cancer perks.           Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on           the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.                            HAZEL            Need to sit.           Gus sits down next to her on the bed.                            HAZEL            Don t get any ideas.            (catching her breath)            All that standing... and stairs...            and then more standing... lotta            standing for me.                            GUS            I understand.             21.                                                       HAZEL            I ll be fine in a minute. Unless I            faint. I m a bit of a Victorian            lady, fainting-wise.           Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:                            GUS            You ok?           Hazel nods, smiles.                            GUS            So what s your story?                            HAZEL            I already told you my story. I was                            DIAGNOSED --                            GUS            Not your cancer story. Your story.            Interests, hobbies, passions, weird            fetishes...                            HAZEL            Um...

First            thing that comes to mind.                            HAZEL             An Imperial Affliction.                             GUS            Ok. What s that?                            HAZEL            It s a novel. My favorite novel.                            GUS            Does it have zombies?                            HAZEL                            (LAUGHING)            What? No.                            GUS            Stormtroopers.             22.

HAZEL            It s not, it s... kind of my bible            actually.                            GUS            Interesting. What s it about?                            HAZEL            Cancer.            (off his look)            But not in that way, trust me. The            guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,            he s... well, the only person I ve            ever come across who seems to a)            understand what it s like to be            dying and b) not have died.                            GUS                            (INTRIGUED)            In that case... I am going to read            this horrible book with the boring            title that does not contain zombies            or stormtroopers. And in            exchange...           Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.                            GUS            ... all I ask is that you read this            brilliant and haunting novelization            of my favorite video game.           Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.           She s adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him           and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a           brief, charged moment.                            GUS            Your hands are cold.                            HAZEL            Not so much cold as under-            oxygenated.                            GUS            Ooh Hazel Grace...                            (BEAT)            I love it when you talk medical to            me.           Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO:             23.                                       INT HAZEL S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT           Hazel sits in bed reading Gus s novella.

Frannie looks intrigued.                            FRANNIE            Did he give it to you?                            HAZEL            By  it  do you mean herpes?           Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel s phone buzzes. She excitedly           checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.                            FRANNIE            I m sure he ll call, don t worry.                            HAZEL            I m not worried. Please. It s not            like I m waiting for him to call or            anything. I just... we hung out. No            big deal.           Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel           rolls her eyes. CUT TO:            QUICK SERIES OF SCENES:           Hazel continues  not to wait  for Gus s call. We see her:           - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone.           - Watching TV. And checking her phone.           - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.           - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check           her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.           And checking the phone.           Where is he?! Did he forget about her?                                       INT HAZEL S DINING ROOM - NIGHT           Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She s a little           sullen, barely touching her food.           Hazel s phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to           check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly           looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her           eyes bug out. We see:             24.                                       Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something.            Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share           a quick glance. A second later, there s a follow-up text.            Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!            Hazel smiles again.           And then a third text:             A BOOK CAN T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD S            NAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!            Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel           looks up.                            MICHAEL            Would you like to be excused?                                       EXT HAZEL S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER           Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus           answers on the first ring.             GUS (O.S.)            Hazel Grace.                            HAZEL            Welcome to the sweet torture of            reading  An Imperial --            At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other           end of the phone.                            HAZEL            What the -- are you ok?             GUS (O.S.)            Me? Yeah. I m excellent.

Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it.             25.                                        GUS (O.S.)                            (TO ISAAC)            Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel            make this better or worse?           Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.                            GUS            Isaac! Focus. On. Me.           Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:             GUS (O.S.)                            (TO HAZEL)            How fast can you get here?

She hears an ungodly moan before           she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus           appears at the base.                            GUS            (calling to Isaac)            Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is            coming downstairs.           Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to           follow him into the room. Before he does:                            GUS            A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the            midst of a psychotic episode.                            (HAZEL NODS)            You look nice, by the way.           Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac           sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down           his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food           lie around him.                            HAZEL            How ya doing Isaac?           Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.                            GUS            Seems Isaac and Monica are no            longer a going concern.                            HAZEL            Oh I m sorry.                            (BEAT)            Do you want to talk about it?           Isaac starts to sob again.             26.                                                       GUS            He just wants to cry and play video            games.                            HAZEL            Fair enough.                            GUS            It doesn t hurt to talk to him,            however. If you have any sage words            of feminine advice...                            HAZEL            I actually think his response is            appropriate.                            GUS             Pain demands to be felt.                             HAZEL            (lights up at that)            You re quoting my book!           Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another           howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank           Isaac. He finally speaks.                            ISAAC            She didn t want to do it after the            surgery. Said she couldn t handle            it. I m about to lose my eyesight            and she can t handle it.           Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.                            ISAAC            I kept saying  always  to her.            Always, always, always. And she            just kept talking over me and not            saying it back. It was like I was            already gone, you know?  Always             was a promise! You can t break            promises.                            HAZEL            Sometimes people don t understand            the promises they re making when            they make them.                            ISAAC            Right, sure, but you keep the            promise anyway. That s what love            is. Love is keeping the promise            anyway.                            GUS            That could be an  encouragement.            It s silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny           look on his face.             27.                                                       GUS            Isaac...?

Gus hands Isaac something           else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it           against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the           pillow like a maniac.                            GUS            That s it! Punch that thing.           And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,           cigarette dangling from his mouth.                            GUS            I ve been wanting to call you on a            nearly minutely basis but I have            been waiting until I could form a            coherent thought in re:  An            Imperial Affliction.                             (SHE SMILES)            I can t stop thinking about it.                            HAZEL            I know, right?                            GUS            The only problem is the ending.                            HAZEL            It is rather abrupt.                            GUS            It s torture! I mean, I totally get            that she died or whatever - Anna.            But there is an unwritten contract            between author and reader and I            think ending your book in the            middle of a sentence kind of            violates that contract.                            HAZEL            But that s part of what I like            about it. It portrays death            truthfully. You die in the middle            of your life, in the middle of a            sentence. But I do - God, I do want            to know what happens to everyone            else.                            GUS            Yeah like her Mom.

Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac s hand.                            GUS            Pillows don t break.           Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.                            GUS            You need to break something.           Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.           Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy           breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands           him another.                            GUS            Go to town, my friend.           And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.                            GUS            I ve been looking for a way to tell            my Dad that I kinda hate            basketball. Think maybe we ve found            it.           Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.           Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left           Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.                            GUS            Feel better?           Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm           around him but looks at Hazel.             29.

The cursor blinks on a blank           page. And then Hazel starts writing...             HAZEL (V.O.)             Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name            is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend            Augustus Waters, who read your book            - at my recommendation - just            received an email from you at this            address. I hope you will not mind            that he shared that email with me.              32.                                      While Hazel reads the letter, we see a SERIES OF SCENES           showing the next several days. They include:           - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He s           enthusiastically telling a story and she s enjoying every           moment of it.           - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It s no use.             HAZEL (V.O.)             I was wondering if you wouldn t            mind answering a few questions I            have about what happens after the            end of the book. Specifically, the                            FOLLOWING:            - In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.             HAZEL (V.O.)             Does Anna s Mom marry the Dutch            Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man            up to something - or is he just            misunderstood? What happens to            Anna s friends?           - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.             HAZEL (V.O.)            Lastly, I was hoping you could shed            some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.            These questions have haunted me for            years. And I don t know how long I            have left to get answers to them.            And finally, back in Hazel s bedroom. She finishes reading           this letter into the phone.                            HAZEL             I know these are not important            literary questions and that your            book is full of important literary            questions, but I would just really            like to know.            INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.                            HAZEL            (reading it aloud to him)             And of course, if ever you do            decide to write anything else, even            if you don t want to publish it,            I d love to read it. Frankly, I d            read your grocery lists. Yours with            great admiration, Hazel Grace            Lancaster. Age 16.

But then again,            Van Houten uses words like             tendentious  and...  bacchanalia             so I think he ll like it.           Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.                            HAZEL            Is it really almost 1?                            GUS            Guess so.

Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain           pump, self-administering morphine.                            ISAAC            Gus was here earlier.                            HAZEL            (trying to be nonchalant)            Was he?           Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.                            ISAAC            Mmm... that s better.                            HAZEL            The pain?            (off his slow nod)            Good. Good, Isaac.            (Isaac closes his eyes)            What about Gus?           But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say           about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand.

Not that I don t            trust you, but how could I trust            you, I barely know you.

Forget I mentioned it.           A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on           the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.             HAZEL (V.O.)

She quickly looks away, blushing.           Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about           is  CRUSH . She tries not to seem too excited.

He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of           bright orange TULIPS.           Michael gets out of the passenger s seat to help Hazel out of           the car. Gus rises to assist them.                            MICHAEL            Is that a Rik Smits jersey?                            GUS            It is indeed.

She s put           the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on           LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.           ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.                            MICHAEL            You re a survivor yourself?                            GUS            (taps his leg)            Didn t cut this fella off for the            hell of it. Though it is an            excellent weight-loss strategy.

Seems to           like what she sees a lot more than before.           BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:                            MICHAEL            Son, you have to understand...            Hazel s still pretty sick. She will            be the rest of her life.           ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this.

HAZEL            You re not a virgin.            (off his look)            Are you really?           Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.                            GUS            See this? This circle is virgins...           Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.                            GUS            And this... is 17 year old dudes            with one leg.           Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk           up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the           ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a           set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.

He removes some sandwiches           and orange juice out of a basket.                            GUS            Sandwich?

HAZEL            Cause I d totally kiss you either            way.           And kiss him she does. He s surprised. And when it s over,           they sit back, look at one another.

INT HAZEL S UTILITY ROOM - DAY           Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case.                            FRANNIE            It s too much, Haze. We can t            accept something like that from a            virtual stranger.                            HAZEL            He s not a stranger.                            FRANNIE            Really?                            HAZEL            Don t be gross.                            FRANNIE            It s still  no,  I m afraid.                            HAZEL            Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?                                       INT DOCTOR S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY           Where Hazel s oncologist DR. MARIA shakes her head.             DR. MARIA            That s out of the question.                            HAZEL            You said the PET scan was            encouraging!             DR. MARIA            The PET scan is encouraging. We            just don t know how long it ll stay            that way. What if you get sick in a            foreign country?                            HAZEL            They have doctors in Amsterdam. And            cancer. Someone will know what to            do.             44.                                        DR. MARIA            Be that as it may, without someone            familiar with your particular case,            I can t --                            HAZEL            (turns to her Mom)            So you ll come too.                            FRANNIE            What?                            HAZEL            The Genies can hook it up. They re            loaded.                            FRANNIE                            I --                            HAZEL            You ve never been to Amsterdam,            have you Mom?           And judging from her face, seems she d kinda like to. Dr.           Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid s got a point.           Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:             BLACK.           Over which, we HEAR:             HAZEL (V.O.)            And then this happened.                                       INT HAZEL S BEDROOM - NIGHT           [Note: There s no sound in this sequence. Just images.]           Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking           and holding her head.           Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,           frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.             HAZEL (V.O.)            People talk about the courage of            cancer patients. And I do not deny            that courage...           He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking           with her daughter, promising her it ll all be ok. Whatever           nightmare this is, it s going to end. CUT TO:                                       INT FRANNIE S CAR - MOMENTS LATER           Still silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together.           Frannie s in the back with Hazel s head in her lap.             45.                                      Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or           terror, we do not know.             HAZEL (V.O.)            I d been poked and stabbed and            poisoned for years and still I trod            on.                                       INT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER           Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room.           They re practically running. There s still no sound.             HAZEL (V.O.)            But make no mistake...           The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.           She s wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We           stay with her and WE HEAR:             HAZEL (V.O.)            In that moment I would have been            very, very happy to die.            END SEQUENCE.                                       INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING           The sound returns. And it s the sound of a heart monitor.           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It s also the sound of a working heart.           Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.                            HAZEL S NURSE            Hello.                            HAZEL            Hi.                            HAZEL S NURSE            You re ok, Hazel.           Even Hazel seems surprised by that.                            HAZEL S NURSE            Would you like to see your parents?           Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come           bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much           relief. CUT TO:           LATER. Hazel s bed has been raised up so she can talk to her           parents  comfortably.                             FRANNIE            They thought it was a brain tumor.                            MICHAEL            It wasn t - thank god --             46.                                                       HAZEL            So what happened?                            FRANNIE            The usual. Fluid in the lungs,            preventing oxygenation. They put            that in...           There s a TUBE in Hazel s side draining fluid into a plastic           bladder that hangs off her bed.                            FRANNIE            Drained a liter and a half last            night.           (That s a lot of fluid.)                            MICHAEL            The good news is... no tumor            growth. No new tumors in your body.           Hazel nods. That is a relief.                            MICHAEL            We re all so relieved.           Frannie embraces her daughter.                            FRANNIE            This is just a thing Hazel. It s a            thing we can live with.           Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace           Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:                                       INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER           Here s Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It s           unclear how long he s been waiting there. He sees Michael           walk down the hall. Races after him.                            GUS            Mr. Lancaster! How s she doing?                            MICHAEL            Better, thank you. Much better.           Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.                            GUS            They won t let me in. Family only.                            MICHAEL            I m sorry --                            GUS            No I get it. Will you just... will            you tell her I was here?             47.                                                       MICHAEL            Of course I will.           Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won t get to see           her, he still wants to stay.                            MICHAEL            Gus.           Michael really likes this kid.                            MICHAEL            Why don t you go home, get some            rest?           Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO:                                       INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER           Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table           along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole            Cancer Team.                             ONCOLOGIST #1            The great news is... Phalanxifor            continues to control your tumor            growth.                            (BEAT)            The not so great news is we re            still seeing serious problems with            fluid accumulation.                            (BEAT)            So how should we proceed?           Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to           answer. No one does.                            HAZEL            Um, I feel like I m not the most            qualified person to answer that.                            ONCOLOGIST #1            I was talking to Dr. Simmons.           DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.             DR. SIMMONS            It s a strange case. Normally the            tumors start resisting the            treatment. But that hasn t happened            here - yet.           Hazel hears the  yet  the loudest.             DR. SIMMONS            Unfortunately, the drug may be            worsening the edema.             48.                                        DR. MARIA            But if we stopped it entirely,            we re likely to face even graver            dangers.                            MICHAEL            So we re gonna do nothing?             DR. MARIA            That s what we have to decide. The            truth is... very few people have            been on Phalanxifor as long as            Hazel has. We don t really know the            long term effects.           That comforts no one.                            HAZEL            Can t I just get like a lung            transplant or something?           The Doctors look at one another like  who wants to take that           one?  Eventually:             DR. MARIA            You would not be considered a...            strong candidate for a transplant.           Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn t bother           her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a           little bit. He grabs Frannie s hand.             DR. SIMMONS            We re trying to prevent endothelial            growth while at the same time            preventing immunosorbent...           As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,           Hazel s eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates           what she s doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,           crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:                                       INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACK           We saw this once before. It looks like the end for 13-year           old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her           mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:                            FRANNIE            (through the tears)            Are you ready, sweetie?           13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The           anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.           Cause she totally hears her mother say:                            FRANNIE            I won t be a mom anymore.             49.                                      She falls into her husband s chest. And we re BACK TO:                                       INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM           Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her           staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is           still talking nonsense when:                            HAZEL            I have a question.             DR. MARIA            Yes Hazel.                            HAZEL            Can I still go to Amsterdam?           Dr. Simmons can t help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at           him. He clears his throat.             DR. SIMMONS            That would not be wise at this            juncture.                            HAZEL            Why not?             DR. SIMMONS            Excuse me?                            HAZEL            Why not, Dr. Simmons?             DR. SIMMONS                            I --           The doctors are trying to be delicate here.             DR. MARIA            It would... increase some risks --                            HAZEL            So does going to the mall --             DR. MARIA            Yes but an airplane?                            HAZEL            They have oxygen on airplanes.                            FRANNIE                            HAZEL --                            HAZEL            It s my life, right?             DR. SIMMONS            You re Stage IV --             50.                                                       HAZEL            I have this opportunity I may never            have again. If the medicine s            working, I don t see why --             DR. SIMMONS            Because, Hazel.                            (BEAT)            Look, I don t know any other way to            say this... You re just too sick.           And this is like a punch in the gut.             DR. SIMMONS            I m sorry.           Everyone feels horrible now. Dr. Maria, Frannie and Michael,           and even Hazel. This meeting couldn t have gone worse. And we                           CUT TO:                                       EXT HAZEL S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY           Hazel parent s bring her home from the hospital. She looks           miserable. It s clear the last few days have been a big           emotional set back.

Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from           Gus that reads:  ok?  Hazel looks at it.           And she doesn t write back. CUT TO:                                       INT HAZEL S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT           Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael           comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:                            MICHAEL            Gus again.           Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael           says into the phone.                            MICHAEL            I m sorry Gus, she s asleep.           Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.             51.                                       INT HAZEL S BEDROOM - LATER           Hazel reads from  An Imperial Affliction.  Her phone buzzes           again.  Augustus.  It just says  hello?  Again she ignores           it.           And then a second text. She looks at it.  The silence is           deafening.  She puts the phone back down.           Hazel s heart breaks. She can t take it anymore. She picks           the phone back up. She texts the following:            I don t know if you ll understand this but I can t see you           anymore. I mean I want to. I just...            She thinks about the rest. She writes:            I m a grenade.            She sends the text. Waits.           And then there s more to say. She sends a second text.            When I look at you, all I can see is what I m going to put           you through. I can t have that. I m sorry.            She sends that text. Waits.           He writes back.            Ok.            Hazel reads it. Writes back:  Ok.            A beat. Gus responds:  oh my god, stop flirting with me!            Hazel smiles - she can t help herself! - but she must. She           gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away.

She looks at the old rusty SWING SET           that s been in her backyard for years.             52.                                      And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets           herself cry.           Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a           decision.           Hazel dials her phone. We hear:             GUS (O.S.)            Hazel Grace!                            HAZEL            Hi Augustus.             GUS (O.S.)

It s just... everything.           Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of           silence pass by.             GUS (O.S.)            I demand to see this swing set of            tears.           Hazel can t help but smile and we CUT TO:           LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus.

GUS            All efforts to save me from you            will fail.           Hazel looks at him. He s sure not making this easy.                            GUS            Is this about Amsterdam?

They stand there quietly a few           more beats, looking out at the swing set.

Dear Hazel, I have received word            via the Genies that you will be            visiting us with Augustus Waters            and your mother beginning on the            4th. A week away! Peter and I are            delighted and cannot wait to --           Hazel is confused. She stands and walks into the hallway.                            HAZEL            Mom?           No response.                            HAZEL            Mom!                            (STILL NOTHING)             MOM!!!

HAZEL            Did you ever call the Genies to            tell them the trip is off? I just            got an email from Peter Van            Houton s assistant. She still            thinks we re coming.           Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly           unsure what to say.             56.                                                       HAZEL            What?

When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.           Hazel sends Gus the following text:  STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)            A moment later Gus responds:  EVERYTHING S COMING UP WATERS!            Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then           tries to calm herself, knowing it s the best thing.                            HAZEL            (whispering to her lungs)            One week, lungs.

Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another           hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.

They get out of the car and           head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.           As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A           WOMAN S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:             GUS (O.S.)             BECAUSE IT S MY LIFE, MOM. IT             BELONGS TO ME!           Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly           spins her back to the car.                            HAZEL            Mom?                            FRANNIE            We can t eavesdrop, Hazel.           Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure           what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.           A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel           bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.                            GUS                            (TO FRANNIE)            Always a pleasure to see you ma am.

She just           says, when they stop and look at her:                            FRANNIE            Amsterdam!

Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.           Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.           She seems determined to get through this without any help.           But upon reaching the other side it s clear that even these           few steps without oxygen were a struggle.           Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady           herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula           back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and           focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,           nervously.                            HAZEL            (with some difficulty)            Amsterdam!

A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.                            HAZEL            Oh that s not necessary.           But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.           We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the           attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.             59.

The GIRL S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.                            GIRL S MOTHER            Jackie... Oh, I m sorry.

HAZEL            I dunno. Wanna try?           Hazel removes her cannula and let s the Little Girl try it.                            LITTLE GIRL            Tickles.                            HAZEL            Right?                            LITTLE GIRL            I think I m breathing better.                            HAZEL            Well... I d love to give you my            cannula but... I kinda really need            the help.           The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly           reattaches it.                            LITTLE GIRL            Thanks for letting me try it.           They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to           her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.             AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)

INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER           Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at           the window. He looks around, antsy.                            HAZEL            Have you never been on a plane            before?           Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he s nervous. He pulls a           cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within           seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.                            FLIGHT ATTENDANT            Sir, you can t smoke on this plane.            Or... any plane.                            GUS            (cigarette in his mouth)            I don t smoke.

He puts the            killing thing in his mouth but            doesn t give it the power to kill            him.                            FLIGHT ATTENDANT                            (NO NONSENSE)            That metaphor is prohibited on            today s flight.           Gus nods and puts the cigarette away.                            PA SYSTEM             Flight attendants, prepare for            departure.            The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards           take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs           the arm rest, his eyes wide.                            HAZEL            Ok?           Gus doesn t say it back. Hazel laughs.                            HAZEL            This is what it feels like to ride            in a car with you.           Gus grabs Hazel s hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out           the window - they re flying! - and then back to Hazel.                            GUS            We re flying! Look!           Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.             61.                                                       GUS            Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS             EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL             OF HUMAN HISTORY!           He s adorable at this moment. Hazel can t resist leaning over           to give him a kiss on the cheek.                            FRANNIE            (not looking up from her                            MAGAZINE)            Just so you know, I m right here.            Sitting next to you. Your mother.                            HAZEL            We re just friends, Mom.                            GUS            She is. I m not.           Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs -  what, it s the truth.            Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:           LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie s asleep. Hazel           and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he           watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches           it with gusto.           Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she s falling           in love. CUT TO:           SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:                                       EXT/ INT AMSTERDAM HIGHWAY - TAXI CAB - MORNING           Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB.                            CAB DRIVER            Americans?                            FRANNIE            We re from Indiana.                            CAB DRIVER            Indiana. They steal from the            Indians but the keep the name, yes?           Hazel and Gus share a look.                            HAZEL            Something like that.           Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt           tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,           it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.                            HAZEL            (to the Driver)            This is Amsterdam?             62.                                                       CAB DRIVER            Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the            rings of a tree. It gets older as            you get closer to the center.           Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and           suddenly, it s as if they re transported - not only to           another universe but to another time as well.           We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a           windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone           rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They re astounded.                                       INT HOTEL - LATER           Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.           We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -           welcoming their arrival. Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed.                            GUS            I ll be right down the hall.           Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:                                       INT HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER           Some time later. Hazel stirs. Her Mom is seated in a sagging,           paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.                            HAZEL            Good morning.                            FRANNIE            Actually, it s five o clock.                            HAZEL            How was the park?                            FRANNIE            Never made it.                            HAZEL            Mom!                            FRANNIE            What? I like watching you sleep.           Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom           still can t enjoy herself.                            FRANNIE            I promise I ll do crazy Mom stuff            tonight while you and Gus are at            dinner.                            HAZEL            What do you mean?             63.                                                       FRANNIE            You have reservations at a place            called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set            it up. Very fancy according to the            Book. And romantic.                            HAZEL            Mom...                            FRANNIE            I m just saying...                            HAZEL            A 16 year old girl running free            with an older boy on the streets of            a foreign city famous for its vice            and debauchery... is totally cool            with you. Is that what you re            saying?                            FRANNIE            (beat, excited)            Let s get you dressed!           Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:                                       INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER           Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored           BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.                            FRANNIE            (calling to the bathroom)            Hazel! Gus is here.                            (TO GUS)            Looking sharp.                            GUS            Thank you ma am.           A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears           a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...                            GUS            Wow.                            HAZEL             I...                            (BEAT)            Am I under-dressed?                            GUS            You look gorgeous.           Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They re ready to go.             64.                                       INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER           Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM           TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the           wind like a spring snowstorm.           An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens           all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls           on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto           the city. Excited. The night just beginning.                                       EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER           At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and           Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water.                            HOSTESS            Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.           Gus pulls out Hazel s chair for her. A WAITER brings them a           bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.                            HOSTESS            The champagne is our gift.           Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The           champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.                            GUS            Ok.           Hazel raises hers.                            HAZEL            Ok.           They clink glasses and sip.                            HAZEL            Wow that s good.                            WAITER            Do you know what Dom Perignon said            after he invented champagne?

Would you like            a menu or will you have the chef s            choice?           Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.             65.                                                       GUS            The chef s choice sounds lovely.            (the Waiter nods)            And can we get more of this?                            WAITER            We have bottled all the stars for            you this evening, my young friends.           The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.                            GUS            Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.                            HAZEL            Thank you for letting me hijack            your wish.                            GUS            Thank you for wearing that dress            which is like whoa.           Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.           The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:                            WAITER            Belgian white asparagus with a            lavender infusion.

Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with           merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them           and says something in Dutch.                            GUS                            (SHOUTING BACK)            We don t speak Dutch!

This night could not be going any better           so far. CUT TO:           LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.                            GUS            I want this dragon carrot risotto            to become a person so I can take it            to Vegas and marry it.           Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.                            HAZEL            I like your suit.                            GUS            Thanks.

That one s not nearly this            nice.            (off her look)            When I first found out I was sick -            I mean, they told me I had like an            85% chance to be cancer-free. Great            odds, sure. But that meant a year            of torture, the loss of my leg, and            still a 15% chance it might fail.

Bought it for            my 15th birthday. Don t think I d            wear it on a date, though.                            GUS            Are we on a date?

GUS            Oh for sure. I mean, not like a            heaven where you ride unicorns,            play harps, and live in a mansion            made of clouds but, yeah, I believe            in something.           Hazel is surprised.                            GUS            Something becomes of us. It has to.            Otherwise what s the point?                            HAZEL            Maybe there is no point.                            GUS            I refuse to accept that.                            (BEAT)            I won t accept it.           Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is           still not sure she agrees. The hand they ve been dealt too           unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:                            HAZEL            I hope you re right.

And I know            that love is just a shout into the            void, and that oblivion is            inevitable, and that we re all            doomed and that there will come a            day when all our labor has been            returned to dust, and I know the            sun will swallow the only earth            we ll ever have, and I am in love            with you.            (shrugs, matter-of-fact)            Sorry.           At which point, the Waiter reappears.                            WAITER            More stars?           Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on           Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.                            GUS            Just the check, please.                            WAITER            No, sir.                            (BEAT)            Your meal has been paid for by Mr.            Van Houten.           Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is           something else.                                       EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER           Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking           out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the           reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.           Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like           that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:                                       EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING           A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air           outside is equalled by the buzz in:             69.                                       INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME           Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room.                            FRANNIE            I really don t get that shirt.           Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte s  Ceci N est           Pas Une Pipe.  (A painting of a pipe with words below that           mean  This is not a pipe. )                            HAZEL            Van Houten will get it. Trust me.            There are like fifty Magritte            references in  Imperial            Affliction.                             FRANNIE                            (READING)             This is not a pipe.                             HAZEL            Exactly.                            FRANNIE            But it is a pipe.                            HAZEL            No it s not. It s a drawing of a            pipe. See?                            (SHE DOESN T)            All representations of a thing are            inherently abstract. A drawing of a            thing is not the thing itself. Nor            is a t-shirt of a drawing of a            thing the thing itself.           Frannie is still at a loss but she s impressed.                            FRANNIE            When did you get so grown up? I            feel like it was yesterday I was            telling 8-year old Hazel why the            sky was blue. You thought I was a            genius back then.                            HAZEL            Why is the sky blue?                            FRANNIE                            (BEAT)            Because I say so.           A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.                            GUS            Who s ready for some answers!             70.                                       EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER            Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten s white house.                            HAZEL            I m so excited I can barely            breathe.                            GUS            As opposed to other days...?           She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen           tank, and up they go towards his front door.           As they approach, there s a noticeable NOISE coming from           inside the house. It s the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.           Like, obnoxiously loud.           Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There s           no response.                            GUS            Maybe he can t hear over the music?           Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He           tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.           Still excited.           A moment later the door swings open.           It s a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning           hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:             MAN IN PAJAMAS            What?!           Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?                            GUS            Mr. Van Houten?           At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.           Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed           door, they hear this:             MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)                            (SHOUTING)             LEEE-DUH-VIGH!             WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)            Are they here, Peter?           So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can t believe it.             MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)            There are two --                            (BEAT)            Who the hell s  they?              71.                                        WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)            They are Augustus and Hazel, the            young fans with whom you ve been            corresponding.           Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will           help things take a turn for the better.             MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)            The Americans?             WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)            You invited them, remember?             MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)            You know why I left America,            Lidewij? To never have to encounter            Americans. Get rid of them.           Hazel and Gus can t believe it. This is terrible!             WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)            I will not do this Peter. Be nice.           At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose           voice they d been hearing - Van Houten s assistant LIDEWIJ           (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves           Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.           And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,           two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:                            VAN HOUTEN            Which of you is Augustus Waters?           Gus raises his hand tentatively.           Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and           walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.                            LIDEWIJ            Please. I am sorry. Come in.           Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes           a step. Hazel follows. They walk:                                       INT VAN HOUTEN S HOME - SAME           Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile           it s creepy. The walls are empty and white, there s a single           couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That s it.           Van Houten sits in the chair.           Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and           twist-tied.                            HAZEL            Trash?             72.                                                       LIDEWIJ            Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never            opens it.           Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his           slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.                            VAN HOUTEN            Yours are the first missives to            which I ve replied and look where            that got me.           Hazel and Gus take their seats.                            VAN HOUTEN            Scotch?                            HAZEL            Um, no thanks.                            VAN HOUTEN            Augustus Waters?                            GUS            It s 11am.                            VAN HOUTEN            Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and            soda.                            LIDEWIJ            Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?                            VAN HOUTEN            She thinks I have a drinking            problem.                            LIDEWIJ            I also think the Earth is round.           Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it           to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.                            VAN HOUTEN            So you like my book.                            HAZEL            Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made            meeting you his Wish so that we            could come here and talk to you.           Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.                            VAN HOUTEN            Did you dress like her on purpose?                            HAZEL            (looks at her shirt)            Kinda.             73.                                      Van Houten says nothing to that.                            VAN HOUTEN            I do not have a drinking problem. I            have a Churchillian relationship            with alcohol: I can crack jokes and            govern England and do anything I            want to do. Except not drink.           He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.                            GUS            Incidentally, thank you for dinner            last night.                            VAN HOUTEN                            (TO LIDEWIJ)            We bought them dinner last night?                            LIDEWIJ            It was our pleasure.                            VAN HOUTEN                            (SIGHS)            You ve come a long way so... what            is it I can do for you?                            HAZEL            We have some questions --                            VAN HOUTEN            Uh-huh...                            HAZEL            About what happens, you know...            after... the end of your book.            Specifically to those who Anna            leaves behind. Like her Mom, the            Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --                            VAN HOUTEN                            (INTERRUPTING)            How familiar are you with Swedish            hip-hop?           Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?                            HAZEL            I would say... limited?                            VAN HOUTEN            But presumably you know Afasi Och            Filthy s seminal album  Flacken.                             GUS            Um...                            VAN HOUTEN            Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla             immediately.             74.                                      Lidewij sighs but she does as she s told. A few seconds           later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.           Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.                            HAZEL            (yelling over the music)            I m sorry, sir. We don t speak            Swedish.                            VAN HOUTEN                            (YELLING)            Who the hell speaks Swedish? The            important thing is not what            nonsense the voices are saying, but            what the voices are feeling.           The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before           Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.                            GUS            Are you messing with us?                            VAN HOUTEN            Pardon?                            GUS            Is this some kind of performance?                            VAN HOUTEN            Rudolf Otto said that if you had            not encountered the numinous then            his work was not for you. And I say            to you, my friends, if you cannot            hear Afasi Och Filthy s bravadic            response to fearfulness, then my            work is not for you.           Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all           this way for this?                            HAZEL            So anyway... when the book ends,            Anna s mom --                            VAN HOUTEN            (raising a hand to silence                            HER)            Let us imagine that you are racing            a tortoise.           Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly           feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.                            VAN HOUTEN            The tortoise has a ten yard head            start. In the time it takes you to            run ten yards, the tortoise has            moved maybe one yard. And so on,            forever.                            (MORE)             75.             VAN HOUTEN (CONT D)            You are faster than the tortoise            but you can never catch him, you            see, you can only decrease his            lead. Now certainly you can run            past the tortoise as long as you            don t contemplate the mechanics            involved but the question of how            turns out to be so complicated that            no one really solved it until            Cantor s proof that some infinities            are bigger than other infinities.           Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.                            VAN HOUTEN            I assume that answers your            questions.                            GUS                            (TO HAZEL)            I don t know what s going on.                            VAN HOUTEN            And yet you seemed so intelligent            in print, Mr. Waters.            (under his breath)            Must be all that cancer in your            brain.                            LIDEWIJ            Peter!           Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the           situation.                            HAZEL            Can we please, maybe, talk about            Anna for a sec? I mean, I            understand that the story ends mid-            sentence because she dies or she            becomes too sick to continue --                            VAN HOUTEN            I m not interested in talking about            that book.                            HAZEL            - but that doesn t mean her family            and everyone she loves doesn t have            a future, right?                            VAN HOUTEN            I said I m not interested --                            HAZEL                            (GETTING UPSET)            But you promised!                            (CALMS HERSELF)                            (MORE)             76.                            HAZEL (CONT D)            Mr. Van Houten, you said you would            tell us what happens and that s why            we re here. We... I need you tell            me. Surely you ve thought about it.            I mean, as characters --                            VAN HOUTEN            Nothing happens to them! They re            fictions. They cease to exist the            moment the novel is over.           This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won t           accept it.                            HAZEL            They can t!            (again, has to calm                            HERSELF)            I mean, I understand. In a literary            sense. But it s impossible NOT to            imagine some future --                            VAN HOUTEN            I can t do this. Lidewij, get rid            of them, please.            (Lidewij doesn t move, he            turns back to Hazel)            I won t indulge your childish            whims. I refuse to pity you in the            manner in which you re accustomed.                            HAZEL            I don t want your pity --                            VAN HOUTEN            Of course you do. Like all sick            kids, your existence depends on it.                            LIDEWIJ            Peter!                            VAN HOUTEN            (on a roll)            You are fated to live out your days            as the child you were when            diagnosed, the child who believes            there is life after a novel ends.            And we, as adults, we pity this, so            we pay for your treatments, for            your oxygen machines. We give you            food and water though you are            unlikely to live long enough --                            LIDEWIJ             PETER!

VAN HOUTEN (CONT D)            You are a failed experiment in            mutation.                            LIDEWIJ             I RESIGN!           Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But           not Hazel. Van Houten s words have not phased her one bit.           She rises from the couch.                            HAZEL            Hey listen douchepants. You re not            gonna tell me anything I don t            already know about illness. I need            one thing and one thing only from            you before I walk out of your life            and that s for you to tell me what            happens to your goddman characters!                            VAN HOUTEN                            (BEAT)            I cannot tell you.                            HAZEL            Bullshit!                            VAN HOUTEN            I cannot --           Van Houten goes to take a drink but...                            HAZEL            Make something up.           ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands,           surprising everyone.           After a beat:                            VAN HOUTEN            Lidewij. I ll have a martini            please.                            LIDEWIJ            I have resigned.                            VAN HOUTEN            Oh don t be ridiculous.           No one moves. Van Houten realizes he s alone in this.                            VAN HOUTEN            I d like you to leave now.                            HAZEL            You re really not gonna tell us?                            VAN HOUTEN            I would like you... to leave.             78.                                      Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is           if to say  come on, enough of this guy.  CUT TO:                                       EXT VAN HOUTEN S HOUSE - SAME           Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As           they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.                            VAN HOUTEN            Have you ever stopped to ask why            you care so much about your silly            questions?           A beat.                            HAZEL            Go fuck yourself.           Van Houten doesn t have a response to that. He just shuts the           door. And when he does, that s when Hazel gets emotional.                            GUS            Hey. It s ok. It s ok...            (beat, an idea)            I ll write you a sequel.            (she cries harder)            I will. Better than any shit that            drunk could write. With blood and            guts and sacrifice. You ll love it.           Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus           gives her a hug. Afterwards:                            HAZEL            I spent your Wish on that asshole.                            GUS            You did not spend it on him. You            spent it on us.           They embrace once more.                            HAZEL            I wanted...                            GUS            I know... I know. Apparently the            world is not a wish-granting            factory.           This gets a real smile from Hazel. That s when Lidewij comes           outside. Clearly she s been crying too.                            LIDEWIJ            I m so sorry. Circumstance has made            him cruel. I thought meeting you            would help him, if he would see            that his work has shaped real            lives, but... I m very sorry.             79.                                      Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.                            LIDEWIJ            Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.            Have you seen the Anne Frank House?                            GUS            I m not going anywhere with that            monster.                            LIDEWIJ            He is not invited.                                       EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER           Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.                            LIDEWIJ            I m afraid there s no elevator.                            HAZEL            Oh, um, that s alright.                            LIDEWIJ            No, there are many stairs. Steep            stairs.                            HAZEL            I can do it.                            GUS                            HAZEL --                            HAZEL            I can do it!           Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments           today. They are going inside. CUT TO:                                       INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER           A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of           Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of           BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of           them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.                            LIDEWIJ            Shall we?           Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So           far so good. They find themselves in an office space.                            LIDEWIJ            This is the bookcase that hid the            Frank family and four others.           The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set           of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.             80.                                      Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks           at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the           climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen           tank.           Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored           breathing the entire time.           ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.           Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.           Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She s           definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall           to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.                            GUS            You re a champion.           Hazel smiles. When she s feeling up to it they walk into the           next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more           narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this           he looks at Hazel:                            GUS            That s enough --                            HAZEL                            (RESOLUTE)            I m ok.           Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we re aware of her           every breath. It s dark. And it s becoming very difficult.           Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull           herself through.           Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the           wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.                            GUS            We re at the top. That s it.           Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.           She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.           And now they re in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.           This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding           for as long as they could. There s a TIME LINE detailing           their story.                            LIDEWIJ            The only member of the whole family            to survive was Otto, Anne s father.           Gus takes Hazel s hand.                            LIDEWIJ            I don t know how you go on, without            your family.             81.                                      Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads           Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO           details the last days of Anne Frank s life. Over it, we hear           a YOUNG GIRL s VOICE reading from the diary.           The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the           same. The room is dark.             GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)             At such moment s, I don t think            about the misery...            Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the           cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.             GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)             ...but about the beauty that still            remains.            Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she           watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.           Their eyes meet. The emotions build...             GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)             Try to recapture the happiness            within yourself. Think of all the            beauty in everything around you...            and be happy.            And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-           against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they ve           experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a           small eternity.           Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly           notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,           they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...           When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the           whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts  bravo!  Hazel blushes,           Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:                                       INT GUS S HOTEL ROOM - LATER           They fall onto Gus s bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the           moment and now it s Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:                            GUS            It s above my knee.           She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.                            GUS            It tapers a little and then it s            just skin --                            HAZEL            What?             82.                                      Hazel pulls away from him.                            GUS            My leg.                            (BEAT)            Just so you re prepared --                            HAZEL            Oh get over yourself.           Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off           but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can t figure           it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They           shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical           Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:                            HAZEL            I love you, Augustus Waters.                            GUS            I love you too, Hazel Grace.           They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:                                       INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING           Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she           isn t there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.           It reads:  Dearest Augustus...            Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled  Virgins.  And in that           circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled  17 year old dudes           with one leg.  We ll notice part of that circle is now           outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.                                       EXT CAFE - DAY           Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at           an outdoor cafe. They re re-enacting yesterday s events.                            HAZEL             Get up you fat bastard.                             GUS             I can t stand up, I m too drunk.                             HAZEL            I said  get up.                             GUS             Standing is for fools!                             HAZEL            God, what an asshole.           They both giggle at the whole thing.             83.                                                       HAZEL            It was awful, Mom. You can t            imagine.                            FRANNIE            And then what happened?                            HAZEL            Then we went to the Anne Frank            museum.                            FRANNIE            And after that?           A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.                            HAZEL            We just... walked around.           Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it           in check in front of her Mother.                            FRANNIE            Sounds lovely.           A few beats later.                            FRANNIE            Listen... I m gonna stretch my legs            a little. Give the two of you some            time to talk.                            HAZEL                            (THAT S WEIRD)            Um... ok...           As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and           Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie           has left them:                            HAZEL            That was weird.           Gus doesn t respond except to say:                            GUS            Shall we?                                       EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER           They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,           sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he s struggling           with something.                            HAZEL            Augustus?             84.                                                       GUS            There s something I have to tell            you...

Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.                            HAZEL            Oh no...

And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be           sad and feel awful.           But just for a second.

Well guess what, Gus, this is            your life. This is all you get. You            get me, and your family, and this            world. And if that s not enough,            well I m sorry, but it s not            nothing.

Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to           hers in a toast.                            GUS            It s a good life, Hazel Grace.           She softens.

She looks at it -            Gus  - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in           her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:                            HAZEL            Hello?             GUS (O.S.)

INT/ EXT HAZEL S CAR - MOMENTS LATER           Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually           finding herself at the Speedway gas station.           Gus s car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next           to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver s side door,           and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and           blood. She gags from the smell.                            GUS                            (MUMBLING)            Hi.           Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to           his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE           sticking out of it.                            HAZEL                            (PANICKED)            Oh, God, Augustus, I m calling 911.                            GUS            No! Please! Hazel, listen to me.

GUS            Please just look at it.           Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.                            HAZEL            I think it s infected...           Hazel feels his forehead, he s burning up.                            HAZEL            Gus, what the -- why are you here?            Why aren t you home?           Gus throws up.

GUS            No, Hazel, please!           But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which           point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying           teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:             HAZEL (V.O.)

LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel           is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts           moving, Gus grabs her hand.

Hazel is with him. They re watching sports on TV.             HAZEL (V.O.)

Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking           from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.             97.

The problem, of course, is that            there s no way of knowing that your            last good day is your  Last Good            Day.  At the time, it s just            another decent day.           The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.                            HAZEL            Hi, Augustus.             GUS (O.S.)

Is everything --             GUS (O.S.)            I love you Hazel.           The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.                            HAZEL            I gotta go.                            FRANNIE            Finish eating first.

HAZEL            No!                            MICHAEL            Hazel, listen to your mother.           Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.                            FRANNIE            You have to eat, Hazel. You re not            gonna starve yourself to death just            because Gus is sick.

I am going to die and leave            you here alone and you won t have            me to hover around and you won t be            a mother anymore, and I m sorry,            but I can t do anything about it,            ok?! Just leave me alone!           Upon seeing her mother s face change, Hazel immediately           regrets this.                            FRANNIE            You heard me?           Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling           terrible.                            FRANNIE            You heard me say that to your            father?           Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.             99.                                                       FRANNIE            Oh god, sweetie. I m sorry. I was            wrong, ok? It wasn t true. It s not            something I believe.           Michael sits across from them.                            FRANNIE            As long as either of us is alive, I            will be your mother. Even if you            die, I --                            HAZEL            When.                            FRANNIE            Even when you die, I will still be            your mother. I will always be your            Mother.           By now Michael is crying too. They all are.                            HAZEL            I worry that you won t have a life.            That you ll sit around all day with            no me to look after and stare at            the walls and be miserable or off            yourselves or something.

You of all people know it s            possible to live with pain.           She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.                            FRANNIE            I don t just sit around, you know.           Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like,  should I           say something?  She goes for it.                            FRANNIE            I m taking some classes. Online. To            get my master s in social work.                            HAZEL            You are?

Frannie and Michael don t quite know what to say.                            MICHAEL            We didn t want you to feel                            ABANDONED --                            HAZEL            Are you kidding? Mom, this is            awesome! This is fantastic!

And when it s over:                            FRANNIE            I d still really like you to eat.                            HAZEL            I know Mom. And I will. I promise.            But right now... I really gotta go.                                       INT CHURCH - LATER           Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now           empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his           wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we ve ever seen him, thinner           than any young man should be. But for now, he s happy.                            GUS            Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.                            HAZEL            I know, right?                            (BEAT)            So, um, what s going on guys?                            ISAAC            You re late.                            HAZEL            Late for what exactly?             101.                                      Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.                            GUS            I wanted to attend my funeral. By            the way, will you speak at my            funeral?           Hazel looks at him like  of course, silly  and then kisses           him on the mouth.                            GUS            Sweet. I m hopeful I ll get to            attend as a ghost, but just to make            sure, I thought I d - well, not to            put you on the spot, but I thought            I d arrange a pre-funeral.                            HAZEL            Why now?                            GUS            No time like the present.                            HAZEL            (looks around the room)            How did you even get in here?                            GUS            Would you believe they leave the            door open at night?                            HAZEL            Um, no.                            GUS            As well you shouldn t.           He smiles and for a brief moment it s old Gus. Hazel laughs.           Isaac clears his throat.                            ISAAC             Augustus Waters was a self-            aggrandizing bastard. But we            forgive him. We forgive him... not            because he had a heart as            figuratively good as his actual one            sucked, or because he got 18 years            when he should have gotten more.                             GUS             17.                            ISAAC            I m assuming you ve got some time,            you interrupting bastard! I mean            seriously...            (back to the speech)             Augustus Waters talked so much            that he d interrupt you at his own            funeral. And he was pretentious.                            (MORE)             102.                            ISAAC (CONT D)            Sweet Jesus that kid never took a            piss without pondering the            resonances of human waste            production. And he was vain. But            that comes with superhuman            handsomeness.            Gus nods - that part is true.                            ISAAC             But I will say this: when the            scientists of the future show up at            my house with robot eyes and they            tell me to try them on, I will tell            the scientists to piss off, because            I don t even want to see a world            without Augustus Waters.            Hazel smiles - but it s one that triggers an immediate           emotional waterfall.                            ISAAC             And then, of course, having made            my rhetorical point, I will put my            robot eyes on because, I mean...            robot eyes!            Gus has a big smile on his face.                            ISAAC             So anyway, Augustus, my friend...            Godspeed.            Gus nods a couple times.                            GUS            Thank you Isaac.           This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.                            ISAAC            Goddamn it, Gus.                            GUS            Hey don t swear in the Literal            Heart of Jesus.                            ISAAC            Shit! Ass! Balls!           Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.                            ISAAC            Can I get a hand here, Hazel?           Hazel remembers Isaac can t see. She rises, goes up to get           him, walks him back to her seat.                            GUS            Hazel Grace, it s down to you.             103.                                      Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes           a beat to ready herself.                            HAZEL             Augustus Waters was the great star-            crossed love of my life. Ours was            an epic love story, and I won t be            able to get more than a sentence            into it without disappearing into a            puddle of tears.                            (BEAT)            Like all real love stories - ours            will die with us, as it should. I d            hoped that he d be eulogizing me,            because there s no one I d rather            have...            And that s all she can get out before falling apart. She lets           it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.                            HAZEL            (beat, composing herself)             I can t talk about our love story            so instead I will talk about math.            I am not a mathematician, but I            know this: there are infinite            numbers between 0 and 1. There s .1            And .12 And .112 And an infinite            collection of others. Of course,            there is a bigger infinite set of            numbers between 0 and 2, or between            0 and a million. Some infinities            are bigger than other infinities. A            writer we used to like taught us            that. I want more numbers than I m            likely to get, and God, I want more            numbers for Augustus Waters than he            got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot            tell you how thankful I am for our            little infinity. You gave me a            forever within the numbered days,            and for that I am eternally            grateful. I love you.            Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:             BLACK.           Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.                                       INT HAZEL S BEDROOM - NIGHT           Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is           ringing and it s 4am.           She knows instantly.             104.                                        HAZEL (V.O.)            Augustus Waters died eight days            later in the ICU...           Hazel s head falls into her chest.             HAZEL (V.O.)            ... when the cancer, which was made            of him, stopped his heart, which            was also made of him.           Her bedroom door opens. It s Frannie and Michael. This only           confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents           embrace her in the bed.             HAZEL (V.O.)            It was unbearable. The whole thing.            Every second worse than the last.                                       EXT HAZEL S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME           Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She s blaring the loudest           music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the           horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:             HAZEL (V.O.)            One of the first things they ask            you in the ER is to rate your pain            on a scale from 1 to 10. I d been            asked this question hundreds of            times and I remember once, early            on, when I couldn t catch my breath            and it felt like my chest was on            fire, and the nurse asked me to            rate the pain and though I couldn t            speak, I held up 9 fingers.           The loud music isn t protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.           She falls apart nonetheless.             HAZEL (V.O.)            Later on, when I d been feeling            better, the nurse came in and she            called me a fighter.  You know how            I know,  she said.  Because you            called a ten a nine.                                        INT HAZEL S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING           Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.             HAZEL (V.O.)            But that wasn t the truth. The            reason I called it a nine was... I            was saving my ten.             105.                                       INT CHURCH - DAY           The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.           Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,           watching people she s never seen before approach the Waters           family and extend their deepest condolences.             HAZEL (V.O.)            And this was it. The great and            terrible ten.           When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.             MRS. WATERS            He loved you so much.           Hazel nods. Hugs them back.                            HAZEL            He loved you so much too.           More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in           the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She s           not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep           breath, wills herself to walk towards it.           Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.           Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches           herself.                            HAZEL            It s ok, you hear me? It s ok.           She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.           Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights           and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of           the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.                            MINISTER            I think we re ready to begin.           Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in           the middle of the room.                            MINISTER            Augustus Waters fought hard for            many years. His battle was a            courageous one and his strength was            a source of inspiration for each            and every one of us...           Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:                            MALE VOICE            What a load of shit, eh kid?           Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn t make sense. She           turns around and, sure enough, it s Peter Van Houten.             106.                                                       MINISTER            Let us pray.           Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps           staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.                            VAN HOUTEN            We need to fake pray now.           Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns           back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected           appearance.                            MINISTER            Now I call on Augustus s close            friend Isaac to say a few words.           Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone s help.           Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it s really           him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.                            ISAAC            Of all the things I ve lost in my            life, this hurts the most.           And Isaac stops talking. It s unclear if that was the end or           if he just can t go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister           walks back up.                            MINISTER            And now we ll hear from Gus s...            special friend Hazel Lancaster.           Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the           room at the words  special friend.                             HAZEL            I was his girlfriend.           Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.                            HAZEL            There s a beautiful quote in Gus s            home that reads  if you want the            rainbow, you gotta deal with the            rain.            Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:             HAZEL (V.O.)            I didn t believe a word, of course.            But that was ok. Funerals, I d            decided, aren t for the dead.            They re for the living.           Gus s Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:             107.                                       EXT CEMETARY - DAY           Everyone is watching Gus s body be lowered into the ground.           Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.           Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the           burial. He s watching Hazel. CUT TO:           LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.                            HAZEL            I ll be fine.                            FRANNIE            Are you sure? We can drive you --                            HAZEL            No, I d... I d like to be alone for            a while.           Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.           As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.                            VAN HOUTEN            Could I hitch a ride?           Hazel doesn t want to help this man.                            VAN HOUTEN            Just to the bottom of the hill.           Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they re both in the car:                            HAZEL            How did you even --                            VAN HOUTEN            The internet.                            HAZEL            And you just... bought a ticket?                            VAN HOUTEN            The drinks are free drinks in First            Class.           Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a           swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.                            VAN HOUTEN            Omnis Cellula e cellula.           Hazel ignores him.                            VAN HOUTEN            Your boy Waters and I corresponded            quite a bit in his last --                            HAZEL            You read your fan mail now?             108.                                                       VAN HOUTEN            I would hardly call him a fan. He            despised me. But he was quite            insistent I attend his funeral and            tell you what became of Anna and            her mother. So here I am and that s            your answer: omnis cellula e            cellula.                            HAZEL            I m so not in the mood --                            VAN HOUTEN             Life comes from life.                             HAZEL            Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.                            VAN HOUTEN            You don t want an explanation?                            HAZEL            Nope. Thanks though. Have a great            life.                            VAN HOUTEN            You remind me of her.                            HAZEL                            (BEAT)            I remind a lot of people of a lot            of people.                            VAN HOUTEN            She was eight, my daughter. She            suffered... beautifully. For so            long.           Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.                            HAZEL            She had leukemia? Like Anna?                            VAN HOUTEN            Just like her, yes.                            HAZEL            Were you married then?                            VAN HOUTEN            Not when she died, no. I was            insufferable long before Anna, my            dear. Grief doesn t change you,            Hazel, it reveals you.           Hazel takes that in.                            HAZEL            Well I m sorry for your loss.             109.                                                       VAN HOUTEN            And I m sorry for yours. I m sorry            for everything, for being so rude            to you two, for ruining your trip --                            HAZEL            You didn t ruin our trip, you            asshole. We had an awesome trip.                            VAN HOUTEN            Hazel, I m trying. I m trying! You            asked me to tell you what happens            and I wish I could do that. I wish            that I could. But I can t. No one            can. No one knows, Hazel. They            don t talk to us. Unless...           Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to           Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.                            HAZEL            You think I care about that? I            don t give a shit, Van Houten.           Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.                            HAZEL            You re a drunk and a jerk and a            failure. And I d like you to get            out of my car right now so I can go            home and grieve.                            VAN HOUTEN                            (STUNNED)                            BUT --                            HAZEL            Get out of the car!           Van Houten knows he s too late. He does as he s told,           stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands           there as Hazel peels out.           In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if           toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:                                       INT HAZEL S LIVING ROOM - DAY           Hazel lies in front of the TV.  Top Model  is playing but           she s lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she           can t do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.                                       INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS           Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon           there s a knock.             110.                                                       HAZEL                            (THROUGH TEARS)            Occupada.             MICHAEL (O.S.)            Can I come in?           Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down           next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.           Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.           Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn t cry.                            MICHAEL            I m so so sorry.                            (BEAT)            It was a privilege to love him,            though, wasn t it?           Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.                            MICHAEL            Gives you an idea how we feel about            you.           Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn t cry. Hazel draws           strength from him.                                       EXT ISAAC S HOUSE - NIGHT           Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.           They sit on the roof.                            ISAAC            Do you know if it hurt or whatever?                            HAZEL            He was really fighting for breath,            I guess. He eventually went            unconscious, but it seems like,            yeah, it wasn t great or anything.            Dying sucks.                            ISAAC                            (LONG BEAT)            It just seems so impossible.                            HAZEL            Happens all the time.                            ISAAC            Are you angry?                            HAZEL            Very.             111.                                                       ISAAC            Me too.            (a few beats)            Gus really loved you, you know.                            HAZEL            I know.                            ISAAC            He wouldn t shut up about it.                            HAZEL            I know.                            ISAAC            It was annoying.                            HAZEL            I didn t find it that annoying.           They sit there in silence a few beats.                            ISAAC            Did you read the note or whatever            from your author friend?                            HAZEL            He is not my friend and -- how do            you know about that?                            ISAAC            We talked at the cemetery. Said he            came all this way to give you that.                            HAZEL            Yeah well I m over it. I never want            to read another word of that            asshole s again.                            ISAAC            Yeah but he didn t write it - Gus            did.                            HAZEL                            (STUNNED)            What?                            ISAAC            That s what he said. Gus had            written something, sent it to Van                            HOUTEN --           Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.                            ISAAC            What?                            HAZEL            I... I have to go. I... Are you...?             112.                                                       ISAAC            I do it all the time. Go.           As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,           enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.                                       INT/ EXT HAZEL S CAR - DAY           Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash           in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She s about to           give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath           the passenger s seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and           unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:                            GUS S VOICE            Mr. Van Houten, I m a good person            but a shitty writer. You re a            shitty person but a good writer.            We d make a good team. I don t want            to ask you any favors but if you            have the time, and from what I saw            you have plenty, please fix this            for me. It s a eulogy for Hazel.           Hazel is overcome with emotion.                            GUS S VOICE            She asked me to write one and I m            trying, I just, I could use a            little flair. See the thing is...            we all want to be remembered.           She smiles to herself, remembering:           - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.           - The staring contest in Support Group.                            GUS S VOICE            We all want to leave a mark.           - Driving (badly) in Gus s car.           - Their first kiss at the picnic by  Funky Bones.                             GUS S VOICE            But not Hazel. Hazel is different.            Hazel knows the truth. She didn t            want a million admirers, she just            wanted one. And she got it. Maybe            she wasn t loved widely but she was            loved deeply. And isn t that more            than most of us get?           - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.                            GUS S VOICE            When Hazel was sick, I knew I was            dying. But I didn t want to say so.             113.                                       INT ICU - FLASHBACK           Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel s single room in the ICU.           She sleeps. He kneels by her side.                            GUS S VOICE            She was in ICU and I snuck in for            ten minutes and sat with her before            I got caught. Her eyes were closed,            her lungs were intubated...            Gus takes her hand and holds it.                            GUS S VOICE            ... but her hands were still her            hands, still warm, and the nails            painted this dark blue back color            and I just held her hands and I            willed myself to imagine a world            without us and what a worthless            world that would be.           - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that           story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:                                       EXT HAZEL S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER           Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen           tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and           looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.                            GUS S VOICE            She s so beautiful. You don t get            tired of looking at her. You never            worry if she s smarter than you            cause you know she is. She s funny            without ever being mean.                           SHE REMEMBERS:           - The magical dinner at Oranjee.           - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.           - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank s house.           - Falling onto the bed together.            [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the           movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus s leg, we           SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don t make           these images less beautiful. They make them twice as           beautiful - because they re real.]                            GUS S VOICE            I love her, god I love her. I m so            lucky to love her, Van Houten.                            (MORE)             114.             GUS S VOICE (CONT D)            You don t get to choose if you get            hurt in this world but you do have            a say in who hurts you.            - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her           chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.                            GUS S VOICE            I like my choices. I hope she likes            hers.            Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.                            GUS S VOICE            Ok, Hazel Grace?            A beat. Another.           Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:                            HAZEL            Ok.             BLACK.                              ',\n",

We hear male voices  gently singing  Tumbling Tumbleweeds  and a deep, affable,  Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot s, perhaps:      VOICE-OVER   A way out west there was a fella,    fella I want to tell you about, fella    by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At    least, that was the handle his lovin     parents gave him, but he never had    much use for it himself.  This    Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.     Now, Dude, that s a name no one would    self-apply where I come from.  But    then, there was a lot about the Dude    that didn t make a whole lot of sense    to me.  And a lot about where he    lived, like- wise.  But then again,    maybe that s why I found the place    s durned innarestin .  We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at  twilight stretches out before us.      VOICE-OVER   They call Los Angeles the City of    Angels.  I didn t find it to be that    exactly, but I ll allow as there are    some nice folks there.   Course, I    can t say I seen London, and I never    been to France, and I ain t never    seen no queen in her damn undies as    the fella says.  But I ll tell you    what, after seeing Los Angeles and    thisahere story I m about to unfold--   wal, I guess I seen somethin  ever     bit as stupefyin  as ya d see in any    a those other places, and in English    too, so I can die with a smile on my    face without feelin  like the good    Lord gypped me.  INTERIOR   RALPH S  It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking  in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the  dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed  manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.  He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their  expiration dates.      VOICE-OVER   Now this story I m about to unfold    took place back in the early nineties--   just about the time of our conflict    with Sad m and the Eye-rackies.  I    only mention it  cause some- times    there s a man--I won t say a hee-ro,     cause what s a hee-ro?--but sometimes    there s a man.  The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of  milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.      VOICE-OVER   And I m talkin  about the Dude here--    sometimes there s a man who, wal,    he s the man for his time n place,    he fits right in there--and that s    the Dude, in Los Angeles.  CHECKOUT GIRL  She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to  her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with  helicopter rotors spinning behind him.      GEORGE BUSH   This aggression will not stand. . .    This will not stand!  The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at  the little customer s lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.      VOICE-OVER   ...and even if he s a lazy man, and    the Dude was certainly that--quite    possibly the laziest in Los Angeles    County.  The Dude has his Ralph s Shopper s Club card to one side and  is making out a check to Ralph s for sixty-nine cents.      VOICE-OVER   ...which would place him high in the    runnin  for laziest worldwide--but    sometimes there s a man. . . sometimes    there s a man.  EXTERIOR  RALPH S  Long shot of the glowing Ralph s.  There are only two or  three cars parked in the huge lot.      VOICE-OVER   Wal, I lost m train of thought here.     But--aw hell, I done innerduced him    enough.  The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.   Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and  cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.   The two men s footsteps echo in the still of the night.  After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.      DUDE   It s the LeBaron.  DUDE S HOUSE  The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow  court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small  leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the  grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.  INSIDE  The Dude enters and flicks on a light.  His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.   We track with him as he is rushed through the living room,  his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.   Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece  of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a  hole.  The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small  bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of  doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper  bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet  rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the  floor.  The Dude blows bubbles.      VOICE   We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny    said you were good for it.  Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and  gasps for air.      VOICE   Where s the money, Lebowski!  His head is plunged back into the toilet.      VOICE   Where s the money, Lebowski!  The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.      VOICE   WHERE S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!      DUDE   It s uh, it s down there somewhere.     Lemme take another look.  His head is plunged back in.      VOICE   Don t fuck with us.  If your wife    owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that    means you owe money to Jackie    Treehorn.  The inquisitor hauls the Dude s head out one last time and  flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against  the toilet.  The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.  Looming over him is a strapping blond man.  Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly  and walks over to a rug.      CHINESE MAN   Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.  He starts peeing on the rug.  The Dude s hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his  sunglasses.      DUDE   Oh, man.  Don t do--      BLOND MAN   You see what happens?  You see what    happens, Lebowski?  The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.      DUDE   Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You    got the wrong guy.  I m the Dude,    man.      BLOND MAN   Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is    Bunny.      DUDE   Bunny?  Look, moron.  He holds up his hands.      DUDE   You see a wedding ring?  Does this    place look like I m fucking married?      All my plants are dead!  The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a  bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious  native.      BLOND MAN   The fuck is this?  The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights  it.      DUDE   Obviously you re not a golfer.  The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.      BLOND MAN   Woo?  The Chinese man is zipping his fly.      WOO   Yeah?      BLOND MAN   Wasn t this guy supposed to be a    millionaire?      WOO   Uh?  They both look around.      WOO   Fuck.      BLOND MAN   What do you think?      WOO   He looks like a fuckin  loser.  The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger  and peeks over them.      DUDE   Hey.  At least I m housebroken.  The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.      WOO   Fuckin  waste of time.  The blond man turns testily at the door.      BLOND MAN   Thanks a lot, asshole.         ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:  BOWLING PINS  Scattered by a strike.  Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins  flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes,  sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a  ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.  The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant  jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.  A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail  turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.      MAN   Hot damn, I m throwin  rocks tonight.     Mark it, Dude.  We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man  nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried  eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.   He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves  cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He  squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he  addresses the Dude at the scoring table.  The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears  some of its foam on his mustache.      WALTER   This was a valued rug.  He elaborately clears his throat.      WALTER   This was, uh--      DUDE   Yeah man, it really tied the room    together--      WALTER   This was a valued, uh.  Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.      DONNY   What tied the room together, Dude?      WALTER   Were you listening to the story,    Donny?      DONNY   What--      WALTER   Were you listening to the Dude s    story?      DONNY   I was bowling--      WALTER   So you have no frame of reference,    Donny.  You re like a child who    wanders in in the middle of a movie    and wants to know--      DUDE   What s your point, Walter?      WALTER   There s no fucking reason--here s my    point, Dude--there s no fucking reason--      DONNY   Yeah Walter, what s your point?      WALTER   Huh?      DUDE   What s the point of--we all know who    was at fault, so what the fuck are    you talking about?      WALTER   Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you    talking--I m not--we re talking about    unchecked aggression here--      DONNY   What the fuck is he talking about?      DUDE   My rug.      WALTER   Forget it, Donny.  You re out of    your element.      DUDE   This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I    can t go give him a bill so what the    fuck are you talking about?      WALTER   What the fuck are you talking about?!     This Chinaman is not the issue!  I m    talking about drawing a line in the    sand, Dude.  Across this line you do    not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is    not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-    American.  Please.      DUDE   Walter, this is not a guy who built    the rail- roads, here, this is a guy    who peed on my--      WALTER   What the fuck are you--      DUDE   Walter, he peed on my rug--      DONNY   He peed on the Dude s rug--      WALTER   YOU RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This    Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.      DUDE   So who--      WALTER   Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other    Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.     He s gonna be easier to find anyway    than these two, uh. these two  . . .    And he has the wealth, uh, the    resources obviously, and there is no    reason, no FUCKING reason, why his    wife should go out and owe money and    they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?      DUDE   No, but--      WALTER   Am I wrong!      DUDE   Yeah, but--      WALTER   Okay. That, uh.  He elaborately clears his throat.  That rap really tied the room together, did it not?      DUDE   Fuckin  A.      DONNY   And this guy peed on it.      WALTER   Donny!  Please!      DUDE   Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--      DONNY   His name is Lebowski?  That s your    name, Dude!      DUDE   Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should    compensate me for the fucking rug.     I mean his wife goes out and owes    money and they pee on my rug.      WALTER   Thaaat s right Dude; they pee on    your fucking Rug.  CLOSE ON A PLAQUE  We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver  to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International,  honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.  Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room  with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:      YOUNG MAN   And this is the study.  You can see    the various commendations, honorary    degrees, et cetera.      DUDE   Yes, uh, very impressive.      YOUNG MAN   Please, feel free to inspect them.      DUDE   I m not really, uh.      YOUNG MAN   Please!  Please!      DUDE   Uh-huh.  We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and  certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:      YOUNG MAN   That s the key to the city of    Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was    given two years ago in recognition    of his various civic, uh.      DUDE   Uh-huh.      YOUNG MAN   That s a Los Angeles Chamber of    Commerce Business Achiever award,    which is given--not necessarily given    every year!  Given only when there s    a worthy, somebody especially--      DUDE   Hey, is this him with Nancy?      YOUNG MAN   That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the    first lady, yes, taken when--      DUDE   Lebowski on the right?      YOUNG MAN   Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,    Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--      DUDE   He s handicapped, huh?      YOUNG MAN   Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And    this picture was taken when Mrs.    Reagan was first lady of the nation,    yes, yes? Not of California.      DUDE   Far out.      YOUNG MAN   And in fact he met privately with    the President, though unfortunately    there wasn t time for a photo    opportunity.      DUDE   Nancy s pretty good.      YOUNG MAN   Wonderful woman.  We were very--      DUDE   Are these.      YOUNG MAN   These are Mr. Lebowski s children,    so to speak--      DUDE   Different mothers, huh?      YOUNG MAN   No, they--      DUDE   I guess he s pretty, uh, racially    pretty cool--      YOUNG MAN   They re not his, heh-heh, they re    not literally his children; they re    the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,    inner-city children of promise but    without the--      DUDE   I see.      YOUNG MAN   --without  the means  for higher     education, so Mr. Lebowski  has    committed  to sending  all of them    to college.      DUDE   Jeez.  Think he s got room for one    more?      YOUNG MAN   One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went    to college?      DUDE   Well, yeah I did, but I spent most    of my time occupying various, um,    administration buildings--      YOUNG MAN   Heh-heh--      DUDE   --smoking thai-stick, breaking into    the ROTC--      YOUNG MAN   Yes, heh--      DUDE   --and bowling.  I ll tell you the    truth, Brandt, I don t remember most    of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!  Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed  Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI  ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude s sunglassed face is on it; we  realize that, under the magazine s logo and headline, the  display is mirrored.  We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude,  wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.  So does Brandt, the young man we ve been listening to.  He  wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.  Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized  wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.      LEBOWSKI   Okay sir, you re a Lebowski, I m a    Lebowski, that s terrific, I m very    busy so what can I do for you?  He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him  as Brandt withdraws.      DUDE   Well sir, it s this rug I have, really    tied the room together-      LEBOWSKI   You told Brandt on the phone, he    told me.  So where do I fit in?      DUDE   Well they were looking for you, these    two guys, they were trying to--      LEBOWSKI   I ll say it again, all right?  You    told Brandt.  He told me.  I know    what happened. Yes?  Yes?      DUDE   So you know they were trying to piss    on your rug--      LEBOWSKI   Did I urinate on your rug?      DUDE   You mean, did you personally come    and pee on my--      LEBOWSKI   Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla    usted Inglese?  I ll say it again.     Did I urinate on your rug?      DUDE   Well no, like I said, Woo peed on    the rug--      LEBOWSKI   Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I    just want to understand this, sir--   every time a rug is micturated upon    in this fair city, I have to    compensate the--      DUDE   Come on, man, I m not trying to scam    anybody here, I m just--      LEBOWSKI   You re just looking for a handout    like every other--are you employed,    Mr. Lebowski?      DUDE   Look, let me explain something.      I m not Mr. Lebowski;  you re Mr.    Lebowski.  I m the Dude.  So that s     what  you  call me.  That, or Duder.    His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,     you know, you re not into the whole    brevity thing--      LEBOWSKI   Are you employed, sir?      DUDE   Employed?      LEBOWSKI   You don t go out and make a living    dressed like that in the middle of a    weekday.      DUDE   Is this a--what day is this?      LEBOWSKI   But I do work, so if you don t mind--      DUDE   No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.     This will not stand, ya know, this    will not stand, man.  I mean, if    your wife owes--      LEBOWSKI   My wife is not the issue here. I    hope that my wife will someday learn    to live on her allowance, which is    ample, but if she doesn t, sir, that    will be her problem, not mine, just    as your rug is your problem, just as    every bum s lot in life is his own    responsibility regardless of whom he    chooses to blame.  I didn t blame    anyone for the loss of my legs, some    chinaman in Korea took them from me    but I went out and achieved anyway.     I can t solve your problems, sir,    only you can.  The Dude rises.      DUDE   Ah fuck it.      LEBOWSKI   Sure!  Fuck it!  That s your answer!     Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your    answer to everything!  The Dude is heading for the door.      LEBOWSKI   Your  revolution  is over, Mr.     Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums    lost!  As the Dude opens the door.      LEBOWSKI   ...My advice is, do what your parents    did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will    always lose-- do you hear me,    Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--  The Dude shuts the door on the old man s bellowing to find  himself--      HALLWAY   --in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt    is approaching.      BRANDT   How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?      DUDE   Okay.  The old man told me to take    any rug in the house.  WALKWAY  A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down  a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming  pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.      BRANDT   Manolo will load it into your car    for you, uh, Dude.      DUDE   It s the LeBaron.  DUDE S POINT OF VIEW  Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her  back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.  Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the  pool.      BRANDT   Well, enjoy, and perhaps we ll see    you again some time, Dude.      DUDE   Yeah sure, if I m ever in the    neighborhood, need to use the john.  CLOSER TRACK  Arcing around the woman s foot as she finishes painting the  nails emerald green.  THE DUDE  Looking.  WIDER  The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early  twenties.  She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.      YOUNG WOMAN   Blow on them.  The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over  them.      DUDE   Huh?  She waggles her foot and giggles.      YOUNG WOMAN   G ahead.  Blow.  The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.      DUDE   You want me to blow on your toes?      YOUNG WOMAN   Uh-huh. . . I can t blow that far.  The Dude looks over at the pool.      DUDE   You sure he won t mind?  The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He  is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He  wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open,  shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.   One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty  whiskey bottle bobs.      YOUNG WOMAN   Dieter doesn t care about anything.     He s a nihilist.      DUDE   Practicing?  The young woman smiles.      YOUNG WOMAN   You re not blowing.  Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.      BRANDT   Our guest has to be getting along,    Mrs.  Lebowski.  The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still  looking at the young woman.      DUDE   You re Bunny?      BUNNY   I ll suck your cock for a thousand    dollars.  Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:      BRANDT   Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very    free-spirited.  We re all very fond    of her.      BUNNY   Brandt can t watch though.  Or he    has to pay a hundred.      BRANDT   Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That s marvelous.  He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his  SHOULDER:      DUDE   I m just gonna find a cash machine.  BOWLING PINS  Scattered by a strike.  THE BOWLERS  Donny calls out from the bench:      DONNY   Grasshopper Dude--They re dead in    the water!!  As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to  another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that  shares the lane.      DUDE   Your maples, Carl.  Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in  one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.      WALTER   Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it    is no dream.      DUDE   You re fucking twenty minutes late.     What the fuck is that?      WALTER   Theodore Herzel.      DUDE   Huh?      WALTER   State of Israel.  If you will it,    Dude, it is no--      DUDE   What the fuck re you talking about?     The carrier.  What s in the fucking    carrier?      WALTER   Huh?  Oh--Cynthia s Pomeranian.     Can t leave him home alone or he    eats the furniture.      DUDE   What the fuck are you--      WALTER   I m saying, Cynthia s Pomeranian.     I m looking after it while Cynthia    and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.      DUDE   You brought a fucking Pomeranian    bowling?      WALTER   What do you mean  brought it bowling ?     I didn t rent it shoes.  I m not    buying it a fucking beer.  He s not    gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.  He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots  around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging  its tail.      DUDE   Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked    me to take care of her fucking dog    while she and her boyfriend went to    Honolulu, I d tell her to go fuck    herself.  Why can t she board it?      WALTER   First of all, Dude, you don t have    an ex, secondly, it s a fucking show    dog with fucking papers.  You can t    board it.  It gets upset, its hair    falls out.      DUDE   Hey man--      WALTER   Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over    the line!  Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.      WALTER   Smokey Huh?      WALTER   Over the line, Smokey!  I m sorry.     That s a foul.      SMOKEY   Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.      WALTER   Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.      SMOKEY   Bullshit. Walter!      WALTER   This is not Nam.  This is bowling.     There are rules.      DUDE   Come on Walter, it s just--it s    Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a    little, it s just a game.      WALTER   This is a league game.  This    determines who enters the next round-   robin, am I wrong?      SMOKEY   Yeah, but--      WALTER   Am I wrong!?      SMOKEY   Yeah, but I wasn t over.  Gimme the    marker, Dude,  I m marking it an    eight.  Walter takes out a gun.      WALTER   Smokey my friend, you re entering a    world of pain.      DUDE   Hey Walter--      WALTER   Mark that frame an eight, you re    entering a world of pain.      SMOKEY   I m not--      WALTER   A world of pain.  A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a  phone.      SMOKEY   Look Dude, I don t hold with this.     This guy is your partner, you should--  Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.      WALTER   HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM    I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT    ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!  The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter s elbow, making  high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.      DUDE   Walter, they re calling the cops,    put the piece away.      WALTER   MARK IT ZERO!      SMOKEY   Walter--      WALTER   YOU THINK I M FUCKING AROUND HERE?     MARK IT ZERO!!      SMOKEY   All right!  There it is!  It s fucking    zero!  He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.      SMOKEY   You happy, you crazy fuck?      WALTER   This is a league game, Smokey!  PARKING LOT  Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude s car.  The Pomeranian  trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.      DUDE   Walter, you can t do that.  These    guys re like me, they re pacificists.     Smokey was a conscientious objector.      WALTER   You know Dude, I myself dabbled with    pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam,    of course--      DUDE   And you know Smokey has emotional    problems!      WALTER   You mean--beyond pacifism?      DUDE   He s fragile, man!  He s very fragile!  As the two men get into the car:      WALTER   Huh.  I did not know that.  Well,    it s water under the bridge.  And we    do enter the next round-robin, am I    wrong?      DUDE   No, you re not wrong--      WALTER   Am I wrong!      DUDE   You re not wrong, Walter, you re    just an asshole.  They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.      WALTER   Okay then.  We play Quintana and    O Brien next week.  They ll be    pushovers.      DUDE   Just, just take it easy, Walter.      WALTER   That s your answer to everything,    Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism    is not--look at our current situation    with that camelfucker in Iraq--   pacifism is not something to hide    behind.      DUDE   Well, just take  t easy, man.      WALTER   I m perfectly calm, Dude.      DUDE   Yeah?  Wavin  a gun around?!      WALTER    (smugly)   Calmer than you are.  -his irritates the Dude further.      DUDE   Just take it easy, man!  Walter is still smug.      WALTER   Calmer than you are.  DUDE S HOUSE  A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude s beat- up old furniture.  At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing  kalhua, rum and milk.      VOICE   Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don t    wanna be a hard-on about this, and I    know it wasn t your fault, but I    just thought it was fair to tell you    that Gene and I will be submitting    this to the League and asking them    to set aside the round.  Or maybe    forfeit it to us--      DUDE   Shit!      VOICE   --so, like I say, just thought, you    know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.  A beep.      ANOTHER VOICE   Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,    well--at Mr. Lebowski s office.     Please call us as soon as is    convenient.  Beep.      ANOTHER VOICE   Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski    with the Southern Cal Bowling League.     I just got a, an informal report,    uh, that a uh, a member of your team,    uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded    weapon during league play--  We hear the doorbell.  THE DOOR  It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding  middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.      DUDE   Hiya Allan.      ALLAN   Dude, I finally got the venue I    wanted.  I m Performing my dance    quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane    Jackson s Fountain Street Theatre on    Tuesday night, and I d love it if    you came and gave me notes.  The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.      DUDE   Sure Allan, I ll be there.      ALLAN   Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the    tenth.      DUDE   Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.      ALLAN   Just, uh, just slip the rent under    my door.      DUDE   Yeah, okay.  BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM  The  voice continues on the machine.      VOICE   --serious infraction, and examine    your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.      VOICE   Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please    do call us when you get in and I ll    send the limo.  Let me assure you--I    hope you re not avoiding this call    because of the rug, which, I assure    you, is not a problem.  We need your    help and, uh--well we would very    much like to see you.  Thank you.     It s Brandt.  TRACKING  We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.   Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back  over  HIS SHOULDER:      BRANDT   We ve had some terrible news.  Mr.    Lebowski is in seclusion in the West    Wing.      DUDE   Huh.  Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music  washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey  Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly  into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.  BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:      BRANDT   Mr. Lebowski.  Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.      LEBOWSKI   It s funny.  I can look back on a    life of achievement, on challenges    met, competitors bested, obstacles    overcome.  I ve accomplished more    than most men, and without the use    of my legs.  What. . . What makes a    man, Mr. Lebowski?      DUDE   Dude.      LEBOWSKI   Huh?      DUDE   I don t know, sir.      LEBOWSKI   Is it. . . is it, being prepared to    do the right thing?  Whatever the    price?  Isn t that what makes a man?      DUDE   Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.  Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost  in thought.      LEBOWSKI   You re joking.  But perhaps you re    right.  The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.      DUDE   Mind if I smoke a jay?      LEBOWSKI   Bunny.  He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on  his cheeks.      DUDE    Scuse me?      LEBOWSKI   Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light    of my life.  Are you surprised at my    tears, sir?      DUDE   Fuckin  A.      LEBOWSKI   Strong men also cry. . . Strong men    also cry.  He clears his throat.      LEBOWSKI   I received this fax this morning.  Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and  hands it to the Dude.      LEBOWSKI   As you can see, it is a ransom note.

GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON- CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.      DUDE   Bummer.  Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.      LEBOWSKI   Brandt will fill you in on the    details.  He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.   Brandt tugs at the Dude s shirt and points him back to the  hall.  HALLWAY  The soprano s singing is once again faint.  Brandt s voice  is hushed:      BRANDT   Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a    generous offer to you to act as    courier once we get instructions for    the money.      DUDE   Why me, man?      BRANDT   He suspects that the culprits might    be the very people who, uh, soiled    your rug, and you re in a unique    position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm    that suspicion.      DUDE   So he thinks it s the carpet-pissers,    huh?      BRANDT   Well Dude, we just don t know.  BOWLING PINS  CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.  WIDER  Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of  the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying  perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch  bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.  FAST TRACK IN  On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic  chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.      DUDE   Fucking Quintana--that creep can    roll, man--  BACK TO THE BOWLER  Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter s  conversation continues over.      WALTER   Yeah, but he s a fucking pervert,    Dude.      DUDE   Huh?      WALTER   The man is a sex offender.  With a    record.  Spent six months in Chino    for exposing himself to an eight-   year-old.  FLASHBACK  We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,   walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging  the bell.  The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.      DUDE   Huh.      WALTER   When he moved down to Venice he had    to go door-to-door to tell everyone    he s a pederast.  The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man  looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.      DONNY   What s a pederast, Walter?      WALTER   Shut the fuck up, Donny.  PINS  scattered by a strike.  QUINTANA  wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.  Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his  first name,  Jesus .  BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE  They have been joined by Donny.      WALTER   Anyway.  How much they offer you?      DUDE   Twenty grand.  And of course I still    keep the rug.      WALTER   Just for making the hand-off?      DUDE   Yeah.  He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.      DUDE   ...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so     whenever these guys call--      WALTER   What if it s during a game?      DUDE   I told him if it was during league    play--  Donny has been watching Quintana.      DONNY   If what s during league play?      WALTER   Life does not stop and start at your    convenience, you miserable piece of    shit.      DONNY   What s wrong with Walter, Dude?      DUDE   I figure it s easy money, it s all    pretty harmless.  I mean she probably    kidnapped herself.      WALTER   Huh?      DONNY   What do you mean, Dude?      DUDE   Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean    look at it.  Young trophy wife.     Marries a guy for money but figures    he isn t giving her enough.  She    owes money all over town--      WALTER   That...fucking...bitch!      DUDE   It s all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin    said, look for the person who will    benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,    you ll, uh, you know what I m trying    to say--      DONNY   I am the Walrus.      WALTER   That fucking bitch!      DUDE   Yeah.      DONNY   I am the Walrus.      WALTER   Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!     Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!      DONNY   What the fuck is he talking about?      WALTER   That s fucking exactly what happened,    Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!      DUDE   Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?      DONNY   Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed    off?      WALTER   Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking    thing-- I did not watch my buddies    die face down in the muck so that    this fucking strumpet--      DUDE   I don t see any connection to Vietnam,    Walter.      WALTER   Well, there isn t a literal    connection, Dude.      DUDE   Walter, face it, there isn t any    connection.  It s your roll.      WALTER   Have it your way.  The point is--      DUDE   It s your roll--      WALTER   The fucking point is--      DUDE   It s your roll.      VOICE   Are you ready to be fucked, man?  They both look up.  Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of  the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a  windbreaker with a racing stripe and  Jesus  stitched on the  breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball  satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his  partner, O Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.      QUINTANA   I see you rolled your way into the    semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and    me, we re gonna fuck you up.      DUDE   Yeah well, that s just, ya know,    like, your opinion, man.  Quintana looks at Walter.      QUINTANA   Let me tell you something, bendeco.     You pull any your crazy shit with    us, you flash a piece out on the    lanes, I ll take it away from you    and stick it up your ass and pull    the fucking trigger til it goes     click .      DUDE   Jesus.      QUINTANA   You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with    the Jesus.  Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.      WALTER   Eight-year-olds, Dude.  DUDE S BUNGALOW  We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.   His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking  tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an  intermittent clatter.  In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE  BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.  The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall  rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the  Dude opens his eyes.  He screams.  A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man   in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards  the carrier.  The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head  thunking back onto the rug.  A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear  the  La-la-la-la  of The Man in Me.  The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.    The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of  Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.  The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in  front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his  bowling shirt. He looks up.  Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the  Dude s rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing  us, growing smaller.  The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices  that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.   His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic  implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its  weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He  is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down  toward the city, dragged by the ball.  A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us  out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by   the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in  black.  We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections  materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny  surface of an oncoming bowling ball.  We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of  a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being  regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.  The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass  rolling a huge shadow across his face.  The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward  us --finger holes.  The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing  us once again in black..  The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a  bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in  the thumbhole of the rolling ball.  We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde  woman, performing her follow-through.  Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and  away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor;  ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.  We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins  spin, hit each other and drop.  We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.  FADE IN  We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades  in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.   They come from the Dude s Walkman, the headset of which is  now askew, with one arm off his ear.  As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put  him right side around.  His head is now resting against  hardwood floor, not rug.      DUDE   Oh man.  He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the   red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is   blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.  WIDE ON THE ROOM  An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is   in place. The rug is gone.  The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.    The beeps continue.  The phone starts to jangle.  TRACK  We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.    Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a   wrist to  look at  his watch.      BRANDT   They called about eighty minutes    ago.  They want you to take the money    and drive north on the 4 5.  They ll    call you on the portable phone with    instructions in about forty minutes.     One person only or I d go with you.     They were very clear on that: one    person only.  What happened to your    jaw?      DUDE   Oh, nothin , you know.  They have reached the little desk outside of the big  Lebowski s office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key  and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude  along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.      BRANDT   Here s the money, and the phone.     Please, Dude, follow whatever    instructions they give.      DUDE   Uh-huh.      BRANDT   Her life is in your hands.      DUDE   Oh, man, don t say that..      BRANDT   Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:     Her life is in your hands.      DUDE   Shit.      BRANDT   Her life is in your hands, Dude.     And report back to us as soon as    it s done.  DUDE S CAR  We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through  the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter  standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK  SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the  fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look  oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape  bundled in brown wrapping paper.  The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude s door  and hands in the briefcase.      WALTER   Take the ringer.  I ll drive.  The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.      DUDE   The what?      WALTER   The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have    they called yet?  The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it  as the car starts rolling.      DUDE   What the hell is this?      WALTER   My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.     The whites.      DUDE   Agh--  He closes the briefcase.      DUDE   Walter, I m sure there s a reason    you brought your dirty undies--      WALTER   Thaaaat s right, Dude.  The weight.     The ringer can t look empty.      DUDE   Walter--what the fuck are you    thinking?      WALTER   Well you re right, Dude, I got to    thinking.  I got to thinking why    should we settle for a measly fucking    twenty grand--      DUDE   We?  What the fuck we?  You said you    just wanted to come along--      WALTER   My point, Dude, is why should we    settle for twenty grand when we can    keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?      DUDE   Yes you re wrong.  This isn t a    fucking game, Walter--      WALTER   It is a fucking game.  You said so    yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--      DUDE     Yeah, but--  The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.      DUDE   Dude here.      VOICE    (German accent)   Who is this?      DUDE   Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want    us to go?      VOICE   ...Us?   DUDE  Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I m not  handling the money and driving the car and talking on the  phone all by my fucking--      VOICE   Shut the fuck up.    (Beat)   Hello?      DUDE   Yeah?      VOICE   Okay, listen--  Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:      WALTER   Dude, are you fucking this up?      VOICE   Who is that?      DUDE   The driver man, I told you--  Click.  Dial tone.      DUDE   Oh shit.  Walter.      WALTER   What the fuck is going on there?      DUDE   They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it    up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was    in our hands!      WALTER   Easy, Dude.      DUDE   We re screwed now!  We don t get    shit and they re gonna kill her!     We re fucked, Walter!      WALTER   Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.     You re being very unDude.  They ll    call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--  The phone chirps.      WALTER   Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here,    Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These     guys are fucking amateurs--      DUDE   Shutup, Walter!  Don t fucking say    peep when I m doing business here.      WALTER    (patronizing)   Okay Dude.  Have it your way.  The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.      WALTER   But they re amateurs.  The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:      DUDE   Dude here.      VOICE   Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there    is no funny stuff.      DUDE   Yeah.      VOICE   So no funny stuff.  Okay?      DUDE   Hey, just tell me where the fuck you    want us to go.  A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD  It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.      DUDE   That was the sign.  Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.      WALTER   Yeah.  So as long as we get her back,    nobody s in a position to complain.     And we keep the baksheesh.      DUDE   Terrific, Walter.  But you haven t    told me how we get her back.  Where    is she?      WALTER   That s the simple part, Dude.  When     we make the handoff, I grab the guy    and beat  it out of him.  He looks at the Dude.      WALTER   ...Huh?      DUDE   Yeah.  That s a great plan, Walter.     That s fucking ingenious, if I    understand it correctly.  That s a    Swiss fucking watch.      WALTER   Thaaat s right, Dude.  The beauty of    this is its simplicity. If the plan    gets too complex something always    goes wrong.  If there s one thing I    learned in Nam--  The phone chirps.      DUDE   Dude.      VOICE   You are approaching a vooden britch.     When you cross it you srow ze bag    from ze left vindow of ze moving    kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch    you.  Click.  Dial tone.      DUDE   FUCK.      WALTER   What d he say?  Where s the hand-   off?      DUDE   There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!      At a wooden bridge we throw the money    out  of the car!      WALTER   Huh?      DUDE   We throw the money out of the moving    car!  Walter stares dumbly for a beat.      WALTER   We can t do that, Dude.  That fucks    up our plan.      DUDE   Well call them up and explain it to     em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking    simple, I m sure they d fucking    understand it!  That s the beauty of    it Walter!      WALTER   Wooden bridge, huh?      DUDE   I m throwing the money, Walter!     We re not fucking around!      WALTER   The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the    ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!      DUDE   Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but    sooner or later you re gonna have to    face the fact that you re a goddamn    moron.      WALTER   Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here s    the bridge--  There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.   The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from  the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude s body to  grab the laundry.  And there goes the ringer.  He flings it out the window.      DUDE   Walter!      WALTER   Your wheel, Dude!  I m rolling out!      DUDE   What the fuck?      WALTER   Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch    I roll out!  I double back, grab one    of  em and beat it out of him!  The    uzi!      DUDE   Uzi?  Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.      WALTER   You didn t think I was rolling out    of here naked!      DUDE   Walter, please--  Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out  over the road.      WALTER   Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let s    take that hill!  Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he  hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude,  cursing, takes the wheel.  OUTSIDE  Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle  flashes tear open the wrapping paper.  INSIDE THE CAR  The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.  OUTSIDE  The car clunks and screams around in a skid.  INSIDE  The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.  OUTSIDE  As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The  front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps  back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.  WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an   injured knee.  The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,   frantically waving the satchel in the air.      DUDE   WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!  There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto  the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires  squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite  direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring  motorcycles.      DUDE   WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!  The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching  the three red tail lights fishtail away.  AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:      WALTER   Ahh fuck it, let s go bowling.  BOWLING LANE  A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.  WALTER.  He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of  molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable  phone in his lap.  It is ringing.      WALTER   Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used    to say.      DUDE   What the fuck is that supposed to    mean?  What the fuck re we gonna    tell Lebowski?      WALTER   Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don t    see, um-- what exactly is the problem?  The portable phone stops ringing.      DUDE   Huh?  The problem is--what do you    mean what s the--there s no--we didn t--   they re gonna kill that poor woman--      WALTER   What the fuck re you talking about?     That poor woman--that poor slut--   kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said    so yourself--      DUDE   No, Walter!  I said I thought she    kidnapped herself!  You re the one    who s so fucking certain--      WALTER   That s right, Dude, 1  % certain--  Donny is trotting excitedly up.      DONNY   They posted the next round of the    tournament--      WALTER   Donny, shut the f--when do we play?      DONNY   This Saturday.  Quintana and--      WALTER   Saturday!  Well they ll have to    reschedule.      DUDE   Walter, what m I gonna tell Lebowski?      WALTER   I told that fuck down at the league    office-- who s in charge of    scheduling?      DUDE   Walter--      DONNY   Burkhalter.      WALTER   I told that kraut a fucking thousand    times I don t roll on shabbas.      DONNY   It s already posted.      WALTER   WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!      DUDE   Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about    that poor woman?  What do we tell--      WALTER   C mon Dude, eventually she ll get    sick of her little game and, you    know, wander back--      DONNY   How come you don t roll on Saturday,    Walter?      WALTER   I m shomer shabbas.      DONNY   What s that, Walter?      DUDE   Yeah, and in the meantime what do I    tell Lebowski?      WALTER   Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of    rest.  Means I don t work, I don t    drive a car, I don t fucking ride in    a car, I don t handle money, I don t    turn on the oven, and I sure as shit    don t fucking roll!      DONNY   Sheesh.      DUDE   Walter, how--      WALTER   Shomer shabbas.  The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.      DUDE   That s it.  I m out of here.      WALTER   For Christ s sake, Dude.  Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling  alley.  Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the  hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--      DONNY   Oh yeah, how d it go?      WALTER   Went alright.  Dude s car got a little    dinged up--      DUDE   But Walter, we didn t make the fucking    hand- off!  They didn t get, the    fucking money and they re gonna--   they re gonna--      WALTER   Yeah yeah,  kill that poor woman.   He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.      WALTER   Kill that poor woman.      DONNY   Walter, if you can t ride in a car,    how d you get around on Shammas--      WALTER   Really, Dude, you surprise me.     They re not gonna kill shit.  They re    not gonna do shit.  What can they    do?  Fuckin  amateurs.  And meanwhile,    look at the bottom line.  Who s    sitting on a million fucking dollars?     Am I wrong?      DUDE   Walter--      WALTER   Who s got a fucking million fucking    dollars parked in the trunk of our    car out here?      DUDE    Our  car, Walter?      WALTER   And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty    undies.  My fucking whites--Say,    where is  the car?  The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out  at an empty parking space.      DONNY   Who has your undies, Walter?      WALTER   Where s your car, Dude?      DUDE   You don t know, Walter?  You seem to    know the answer to everything else!      WALTER   Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped    spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.      DUDE   It s been stolen, Walter!  You fucking    know it s been stolen!      WALTER   Well, certainly that s a possibility,    Dude--      DUDE   Aw, fuck it.  The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts  ringing again.      DONNY   Where you going, Dude?      DUDE   I m going home, Donny.      DONNY   Your phone s ringing, Dude.      DUDE   Thank you, Donny.  DUDE S LIVING ROOM  The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair,  fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him  on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged,  the other a fresh-faced rookie.  At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude s lap, is chirping.   The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:      DUDE   1972 Pontiac LeBaron.      YOUNGER COP   Color?      DUDE   Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,    coloration.      YOUNGER COP   And was there anything of value in     the car?  DULLY:      DUDE   Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple    of Creedence tapes.  And there was    a, uh. . . my briefcase.      YOUNGER COP   In the briefcase?      DUDE   Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my    papers.  Business papers.      YOUNGER COP   And what do you do, sir?      DUDE   I m unemployed.      OLDER COP   ...Most people, we re working nights,    they offer us coffee.  There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the  floor.  The older cop stares at him.      DUDE   ...Me, I don t drink coffee.  But    it s nice when they offer.  AT LENGTH:      DUDE   ...Also, my rug was stolen.      YOUNGER COP   Your rug was in the car.  The Dude taps the floor with his foot.      DUDE   No.  Here.      YOUNGER COP   Separate incidents?  The Dude stares at the floor.  Silence.      OLDER COP   Snap out of it, son.  The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the   chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer   it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks  on.      DUDE   You find them much?  Stolen cars?  Dude s Voice on Machine The Dude s not in.  Leave a message  after the beep.  It takes a minute.      YOUNGER COP   Sometimes.  I wouldn t hold out much    hope for the tape deck though.  Or    the Creedence tapes.      DUDE   And the, uh, the briefcase?  Beep.      FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE   Mr. Lebowski, I d like to see you.     Call when you get home and I ll send    a car for you.  My name is Maude    Lebowski.  I m the woman who took    the rug.  Beep.  Dial tone.      OLDER COP   Well, I guess we can close the file    on that one.  TRACKING FORWARD  We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown  L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing  industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are  spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude s brilliant  rug.  We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude,  standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky  depths of the cavernous space.  Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude s head.   As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.  We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended  from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the  floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush  in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.  The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two  young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers  reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track  and haul it back for another push.      VOICE   I ll be with you in a minute, Mr.    Lebowski.  She rumbles by in another pass.  All right, we ll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.   Help me down.  The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked   except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts   and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix  look.  Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?      DUDE   Is that what that s a picture of?      MAUDE   In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.    My art has been commended as being    strongly vaginal.  Which bothers    some men.  The word itself makes    some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.      DUDE   Oh yeah?      MAUDE   Yes, they don t like hearing it and    find it difficult to say.  Whereas    without batting an eye a man will    refer to his  dick  or his  rod  or    his  Johnson .      DUDE    Johnson ?      MAUDE   Thank you.  This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.  All right, Mr. Lebowski, let s get down to cases.  My father  told me he s agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a  gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.   Now.  As for this. . .  kidnapping --      DUDE   Huh?      MAUDE   Yes, I know about it.  And I know    that you acted as courier.  And let    me tell you something:  the whole    thing stinks to high heaven.      DUDE   Right, but let me explain something    about that rug--      MAUDE   Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?      DUDE   Excuse me?      MAUDE   Sex.  The physical act of love.     Coitus.  Do you like it?      DUDE   I was talking about my rug.      MAUDE   You re not interested in sex?      DUDE   You mean coitus?      MAUDE   I like it too.  It s a male myth    about feminists that we hate sex.     It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.    But unfortunately there are some    people--it is called satyriasis in    men, nymphomania in women--who engage    in it compulsively and without joy.      DUDE   Oh, no.      MAUDE   Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate    souls cannot love in the true sense    of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance    Bunny is one of these.      DUDE   Listen, Maude, I m sorry if your    stepmother is a nympho, but I don t    see what it has to do with--do you    have any kalhua?      MAUDE   Take a look at this, sir.  She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen  flickers to life.  A title card:  JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS  SECOND CARD:  KARL HUNGUS  AND  BUNNY LAJOYA  IN  A THIRD CARD:  LOGJAMMIN   The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway   to his glass.  From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a  door opening.  On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced   man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in   Lebowski s pool.      DIETER   Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere    iss problem mit deine kable.      DUDE   Shit, I know that guy.  He s a    nihilist.      MAUDE   And you recognize her, of course.  The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.  Bunny The TV is in here.      DIETER   Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.  Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use  the shower.      MAUDE    (grimly)   The story is ludicrous.      DIETER   Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to    verk in zese clozes--  Maude switches off the set.      MAUDE   Lord.  You can imagine where it goes    from here.      DUDE   He fixes the cable?      MAUDE   Don t be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little    matter to me that this woman chose    to pursue a career  in pornography, nor that she has been  banging  Jackie  Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am  one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other  being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts  and--      DUDE   Shit yeah, the achievers.      MAUDE   Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,    yes, and proud we are of all of them.     I asked my father about his withdrawal    of a million dollars from the    Foundation account and he told me    about this  abduction , but I tell    you it is preposterous.  This    compulsive  fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.      DUDE   Yeah, but my-      MAUDE   I m getting to your rug. My  father    and I don t get along; he doesn t    approve of my lifestyle and, needless    to say, I don t approve of his.     Still, I hardly wish to make my    father s embezzlement a police matter,    so I m proposing that you try to    recover the money from the people    you delivered it to.      DUDE   Well--sure, I could do that--      MAUDE   If you successfully do so, I will    compensate you to the tune of 1% of    the recovered sum.      DUDE   A hundred.      MAUDE   Thousand, yes, bones or clams or    whatever you call them.      DUDE   Yeah, but what about--      MAUDE   --your rug, yes, well with that money    you can buy any number of rugs that    don t have sentimental value for me.     And I am sorry about that crack on    the jaw.  The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has  all but disappeared.      DUDE   Oh that s okay, I hardly even--      MAUDE   Here s the name and number of a doctor    who will look at it for you.  You    will receive no bill.  He s a good    man, and thorough.      DUDE   That s really thoughtful but I--      MAUDE   Please see him, Jeffrey.  He s a    good man, and thorough.  LIMO  The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to  the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery  cap a ponytail emerges.      DRIVER   --So he says,  My son can t hold a    job, my daughter s married to a    fuckin  loser, and I got a rash on    my ass so bad I can t hardly siddown.     But you know me.  I can t complain.   THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:      DUDE   Fuckin  A, man.  I got a rash.       Fuckin  A, man.  I gotta tell ya    Tony.  He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves  milk on his mustache.  I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I d lost  a  little  money, I  was down in the dumps.      TONY   Aw, forget about it.      DUDE   Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can t be    worrying about that shit.  Life goes    on!  The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still  holding his drink.      TONY   Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who s your    friend in the Volkswagon?      DUDE   Huh?  His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his  shoulder.  He followed us here.  The Dude turns to look.  HIS POV  Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the  curb.  In the driver s seat we see a fat man s shape.  THE DUDE  He scowls.      DUDE   When did he-  The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half- nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.      SECOND CHAUFFEUR   Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No    arguments.  As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds  his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.      DUDE   Fuck, man!  There s a beverage here!  The waiting limo s back door is flung open.  INSIDE  The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the  rear. The door is slammed behind him.      LEBOWSKI   Start talking and talk fast you lousy    bum!      BRANDT   We ve been frantically trying to    reach you, Dude.  Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from  the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.      LEBOWSKI   Where s my goddamn money, you bum?!      DUDE   Well we--I don t--      LEBOWSKI   They did not receive the money, you    nitwit!  They  did not receive the    goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR    HANDS!      BRANDT   This is our concern, Dude.      DUDE   No, man, nothing is fucked here--      LEBOWSKI   NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE    HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!  The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.      DUDE   C mon man, who re you gonna believe?     Those guys are--we dropped off the    damn money--      LEBOWSKI   WHAT?!      DUDE   I--the royal we, you know, the    editorial--I dropped off the money,    exactly as per--Look, I ve got certain    information, certain things have    come to light, and uh, has it ever    occurred to you, man, that given the    nature of all this new shit, that,    uh, instead of running around blaming    me, that this whole thing might just    be, not, you know, not just such a    simple, but uh--you know?      LEBOWSKI   What in God s holy name are you    blathering about?      DUDE   I ll tell you what I m blathering    about!  I got information--new shit    has come to light and--shit, man!     She kidnapped herself!  Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.      DUDE   Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy    wife, I mean, in the parlance of our    times, owes money all over town,    including to known pornographers--   and that s cool, that s cool-- but    I m saying, she needs money, and of    course they re gonna say they didn t    get it  cause she wants more, man,    she s gotta feed the monkey, I mean--   hasn t that ever occurred to you...?     Sir?      LEBOWSKI    (quietly)   No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not    occurred to me.      BRANDT   That had not occurred to us, Dude.      DUDE   Well, okay, you re not privy to all    the new shit, so uh, you know, but    that s what you pay me for.  Speaking    of which, would it be possible for    me to get my twenty grand in cash?     I gotta check this with my accountant    of course, but my concern is that,    you know, it could bump me into a    higher tax--      LEBOWSKI   Brandt, give him the envelope.      DUDE   Well, okay, if you ve already made    out the check.  Brandt is handing    him a letter-sized envelope which is    distended by something inside.      BRANDT   We received it this morning.  The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton  wadding and unrolls it.      LEBOWSKI   Since you have failed to achieve,    even in the modest task that was    your charge, since you have stolen    my money, and since you have    unrepentantly betrayed my trust.  The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up  inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and  starts to unroll the inner package.      LEBOWSKI   I have no choice but to tell these    bums that they should do whatever is    necessary to recover their money    from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And    with Brandt as my witness, tell you    this:  Any further harm visited upon    Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon    your head.  Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents  of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.      LEBOWSKI   ...By God sir.  I will not abide    another toe.  COFFEE SHOP  The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off  into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little  clinking noises.  AFTER A LONG BEAT:      WALTER   That wasn t her toe.      DUDE   Whose toe was it, Walter?      WALTER   How the fuck should I know?  I do    know that nothing about it indicates--      DUDE   The nail polish, Walter.      WALTER   Fine, Dude.  As if it s impossible    to get some nail polish, apply it to    someone else s toe--      DUDE   Someone else s--where the fuck are    they gonna--      WALTER   You want a toe?  I can get you a    toe, believe me.  There are ways,    Dude.  You don t wanna know about    it, believe me.      DUDE   But Walter--      WALTER   I ll  get  you  a  toe by  this    afternoon--with nail  polish. These     fucking amateurs.   They send us a     toe, we re  supposed to  shit our-    selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My     point is--      DUDE   They re gonna kill her, Walter, and    then they re gonna kill me--      WALTER   Well that s just, that s the stress    talking, Dude.  So far we have what    looks to me like a series of    victimless crimes--      DUDE   What about the toe?      WALTER   FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!  A waitress enters.      WAITRESS   Could you please keep your voices    down--this is a family restaurant.      WALTER   Oh, please dear!  I ve got news for    you: the Supreme Court has roundly    rejected prior restraint!      DUDE   Walter, this isn t a First Amendment    thing.      WAITRESS   Sir, if you don t calm down I m going    to have to ask you to leave.      WALTER   Lady, I got buddies who died face-   down in the muck so you and I could    enjoy this family restaurant!  THE DUDE GETS UP:      DUDE   All right, I m leaving.  I m sorry    ma am.      WALTER   Don t run away from this, Dude!     Goddamnit, this affects all of us!  The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:      WALTER   Our basic freedoms!  He looks defiantly around.      WALTER   I m staying.  Finishing my coffee.  He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak,  affecting nonchalance.      WALTER   Finishing my coffee.  DUDE S BATHROOM  A dripping noise.  The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint  pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.  We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.  The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the  soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.  After the Dude s outgoing message we hear:      VOICE THROUGH MACHINE   Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer    Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.  The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.      VOICE THROUGH MACHINE   We ve recovered your vehicle.  It    can be claimed at the North Hollywood    Auto Circus there on Victory.      DUDE   Far out.  Far fuckin  out.      MESSAGE   You ll just need to present a--  The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of  someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.      DUDE   Hunh?  He looks blearily at the open doorway.  A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is  striding across the living room towards the bathroom.      DUDE   Hey!  This is a private residence,    man!  The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the  cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other  men are entering behind him.  The room is dark now except for spill from the living room;  the men are backlit shapes.  One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small  animal skitters excitedly about the floor.  The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.      DUDE   Nice marmot.  The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it,  screaming, into the bathtub.  The Dude screams.  The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a  frenzy of fearful aggression.      FIRST MAN   Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.  The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to  hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his  head and squishes him back into the water.      SECOND MAN   You think veer kidding und making    mit de funny stuff?      THIRD MAN   Vee could do things you only dreamed    of, Lebowski.      SECOND MAN   Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.     Vee belief in nossing.  He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself  off, spraying the Dude.      DUDE   Jesus!      DIETER   Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!     NOSSING!!  The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking  itself and convulsing in little sneezes.      DUDE   Jesus Christ!      FIRST MAN   Tomorrow vee come back und cut off    your chonson.      DUDE   Excuse me?      FIRST MAN   I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!  The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:      SECOND MAN   Just sink about zat, Lebowski.      FIRST MAN   Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.      SECOND MAN   Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und    skvush it, Lebowski!  NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS  A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a  large parking lot.      POLICEMAN   You re lucky she wasn t chopped, Mr.     Lebowski. Must ve been a joyride    situation; they abandoned the car    once they hit the retaining wall.  They have reached the Dude s car.  The  driver s side   exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude   a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.      POLICEMAN   These were on the road next to the    car.  You ll have to get in on the    other side.  The Dude climbs in the passenger side.      DUDE   My fucking briefcase!  It s not here!      POLICEMAN   Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.     You re lucky they left the tape deck    though.      DUDE   My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what s    that smell?      POLICEMAN   Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept    in the car.  Or perhaps just used it    as a toilet, and moved on.  The Dude tries to roll down the driver s window but it will  not go; he bellows through the glass:      DUDE   When will you find these guys?  I    mean, do you have any promising leads?  The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.      POLICEMAN   Leads, yeah.  I ll just check with    the boys down at the Crime Lab.     They ve assigned four more detectives    to the case, got us working in shifts.  The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman  rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by  the glass.  BOWLING ALLEY BAR  The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a  White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer  nuts.      DONNY   And then they re gonna stamp on it?!      WALTER   Oh for Christ--will you shut the    fuck up, Donny.      DUDE   I figure my only hope is that the    big Lebowski kills me before the    Germans can cut my dick off.      WALTER   Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No    one is going to cut your dick off.      DUDE   Thanks Walter.      WALTER   Not if I have anything to say about    it.      DUDE    (bitterly)   Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me    a very secure feeling.      WALTER   Dude--      DUDE   That makes me feel all warm inside.      WALTER   Now Dude--      DUDE   This whole fucking thing--I  could    be sitting here with just pee-stains    on my rug.  Walter sadly shakes his head.      WALTER   Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.     Fucking Nazis.      DONNY   They were Nazis, Dude?      WALTER   Come on, Donny, they were threatening    castration!      DONNY   Uh-huh.      WALTER   Are you gonna split hairs?      DONNY   No--      WALTER   Am I wrong?      DONNY   Well--      DUDE   They re nihilists.      WALTER   Huh?      DUDE   They kept saying they believe in    nothing.      WALTER   Nihilists!  Jesus.  Walter looks haunted.  Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism,  Dude, at least it s an ethos.      DUDE   Yeah.      WALTER   And let s also not forget--let s not    forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,    an amphibious rodent, for uh,    domestic, you know, within the city--   that isn t legal either.      DUDE   What re you, a fucking park ranger    now?      WALTER   No, I m--      DUDE   Who gives a shit about the fucking    marmot!      WALTER   --We re sympathizing here, Dude--      DUDE   Fuck your sympathy!  I don t need    your sympathy, man, I need my fucking    Johnson!      DONNY   What do you need that for, Dude?      WALTER   You gotta buck up, man, you can t go    into the tournament with this negative    attitude--      DUDE   Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,    Walter!  There is a moment of stunned silence.      WALTER   Fuck the tournament?!  SAD; QUIET:      WALTER   Okay Dude.  I can see you don t want    to be cheered up.  C mon Donny, let s    go get a lane.  They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares  DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:      DUDE   Another Caucasian, Gary.      VOICE   Right, Dude.  STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:      DUDE   Friends like these, huh Gary.      GARY   That s right, Dude.  The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on   Tumbling Tumbleweeds.   A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter  vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam  Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and  wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.  TO THE BARTENDER:      MAN   D ya have a good sarsaparilla?  We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened  the movie.      BARTENDER   Sioux City Sarsaparilla.  The Stranger nods.      THE STRANGER   That s a good one.  Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His  crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.      THE STRANGER   How ya doin  there, Dude?  The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.      DUDE   Ahh, not so good, man.      THE STRANGER   One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser    fella than m self once said, sometimes    you eat the bar and sometimes the    bar, wal, he eats you.      DUDE    (absently)   Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern    thing?      THE STRANGER   Far from it.      DUDE   Mm.  The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the  bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.      THE STRANGER   Much obliged.  He looks back at the Dude.      THE STRANGER   I like your style, Dude.  THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:      DUDE   Well I like your style too, man.     Got a whole cowboy thing goin .      THE STRANGER   Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.     D ya have to use s many cuss words?  The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how  out of place the cowpoke is.      DUDE   The fuck are you talking about?  The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the  bar.      THE STRANGER   Okay, have it your way.  He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.      THE STRANGER   Take it easy, Dude.      DUDE   Yeah.  Thanks man.  He is gone.   Tumbling Tumbleweeds  is ending as we hear an  offscreen voice, breaking the spell:      VOICE   Dude!  Dude!  THE DUDE LOOKS:  Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar,  beckoning.  MAUDE S LOFT  She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just  cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.      MAUDE   Jeffrey, you haven t gone to the    doctor.      DUDE   No it s fine, really, uh--      MAUDE   Do you have any news regarding my    father s money?      DUDE   I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta    respecfully, 69 you know, tender my    resignation on that matter,  cause    it looks like your mother really was    kidnapped after all.      MAUDE   She most certainly was not!      DUDE   Hey man, why don t you fucking listen    occasionally?  You might learn    something.  Now I got--      MAUDE   And please don t call her my mother.      DUDE   Now I got--      MAUDE   She is most definitely the perpetrator    and not the victim.      DUDE   I m telling you, I got definitive    evidence--      MAUDE   From who?      DUDE   The main guy, Dieter--      MAUDE   Dieter Hauff?      DUDE   Well--yeah, I guess--      MAUDE   Her  co-star  in the beaver picture?      DUDE   Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,    you know him?      MAUDE   Dieter has been on the fringes of--   well, of everything in L.A., for    about twenty years.  Look at my LP s.     Under  Autobahn.   The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.      MAUDE   That was his group--they released    one album in the mid-seventies.  The Dude stops between two albums.      DUDE   Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.      MAUDE   Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their    music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.  The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is  the group s name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a  picture  OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW  SLICKED-  back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are  wearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name  under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of  nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.      DUDE   Jeez.  I miss vinyl.      MAUDE   Is he pretending to be the abductor?      DUDE   Well...yeah--      MAUDE   Look, Jeffrey, you don t really     kidnap someone that you re acquainted    with.  You can t get away with it if    the hostage knows who you are.      DUDE   Well yeah...I know that.      MAUDE   So Dieter has the money?      DUDE   Well, no, not exactly.  It s a    complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.     Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to    keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands    in old Duder s--      MAUDE   Do you still have that doctor s    number?      DUDE   Huh?  No, really, I don t even have    the bruise any more, I--  She is scribbling.      MAUDE   Please Jeffrey.  I don t want to be    responsible for any delayed after-   effects.      DUDE   Delayed after-eff--      MAUDE   I want you to see him immediately.  She is picking up a telephone.      MAUDE   I ll see if he s available.  He s a    good man, and thorough.  CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE  His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking  tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of   Comin  Up Around the Bend.   Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso,  a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude s back.  After a  moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His  hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the  Dude s ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.      VOICE   Could you slide your shorts down    please, Mr.  Lebowski?  The Dude s eyes open.      DUDE   Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.      VOICE   I understand sir.  Could you slide    your shorts down please?  DUDE S CAR  The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude  is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror-- and, noticing something, looks again.  HIS POV  A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.  THE DUDE  His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint  between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it  out the driver s window--except that the window is not open.   The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering  sparks.  DUDE S CROTCH  The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs.  The Dude screams.  THE STREET  The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off  to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes  to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone  poll.  INSIDE THE CAR  The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won t open,  and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which  also won t open.      DUDE   Fuck Me.  But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from   the lit butt.  He looks around for it.  Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver s seat cushion  and back cushion.      DUDE   Fuckola, man.  He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.    There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper  sticking out from between the cushions.  The Dude pulls it out.  It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and  dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right- hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that,  Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled  The Louisiana  Purchase.   In red ink is a large circled D and some  handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled  in red throughout.  CRANE JACKSON S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER  We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage  in the background where Allan, the Dude s balding landlord,  is performing a dance moderne.  As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice  hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse  audience.      WALTER   He lives in North Hollywood on    Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--      DUDE   The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.      WALTER   Near the In-and-Out Burger--      DONNY   Those are good burgers, Walter.      WALTER   Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid    is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his    father is--are you ready for this?--   Arthur Digby Sellers.      DUDE   Who the fuck is that?      WALTER   Huh?      DUDE   Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?      WALTER   Who the f--have you ever heard of a    little show called Branded, Dude?      DUDE   Yeah.      WALTER   All but one man died?  There at Bitter    Creek?      DUDE   Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show    Walter, so what?      WALTER   Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote    156 episodes, Dude.      DUDE   Uh-huh.      WALTER   The bulk of the series.      DUDE   Uh-huh.      WALTER   Not exactly a lightweight.      DUDE   No.      WALTER   And yet his son is a fucking dunce.      DUDE   Uh.      WALTER   Yeah, go figure.  Well we ll go out    there after the, uh, the.  He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.      WALTER   What have you.  We ll, uh--      DONNY   We ll be near the In-and-Out Burger.      WALTER   Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We ll, uh,    brace the kid--he ll be a pushover.     We ll get that fucking money, if he    hasn t spent it already.  Million    fucking clams. And yes, we ll be    near the, uh--some burgers, some    beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking    troubles are over, Dude.  RESIDENTIAL AREA  The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated  house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in  front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.      DUDE   Fuck me, man!  That kid s already    spent all the money!      WALTER   Hardly Dude, a new  vette?  The kid s    still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,    depending on the options.  Wait in    the car, Donny.  THE FRONT DOOR  Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish  woman.      WOMAN   Jace?      WALTER   Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter    Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this    is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.      WOMAN   Jace.      WALTER   May we uh, we wanted to talk about    little Larry.  May we come in?      WOMAN   Jace.  They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as  Pilar  CALLS UP THE STAIRS:      PILAR   Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!  There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and  nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man  lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its  midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.   It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct  hisses in and out.      WALTER   That s him, Dude.      VIVA VOCE   And a good day to you, sir.      PILAR   See down, please.      WALTER   Thank you, ma am.  He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered  voice, to Pilar:      WALTER   Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?      PILAR   No, no.  He has healt  problems.      WALTER   Uh-huh.  HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:      WALTER   I just want to say, sir, that we re    both enormous--on a personal level,    Branded, especially the early    episodes, has been a source of, uh,    inspir---  There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year- old, looks at the two men.      PILAR   See down, Sweetie.  These are the    policeman--      WALTER   No ma am, I didn t mean to give the    impression that we re police exactly.     We re hoping that it will not be    necessary to call the police.  He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:      WALTER   But that is up to little Larry here.     Isn t it, Larry?  Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out  the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out  at arm s length, displaying it to Larry.      WALTER   Is this your homework, Larry?  Larry does not respond.      WALTER   Is this your homework, Larry?      DUDE   Look, man, did you--      WALTER   Dude, please!. . .  Is this your    homework, Larry?      DUDE   Just ask him if he--ask him about    the car, man!  Walter is still holding out the homework.      WALTER   Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your    homework, Larry?      DUDE   Is the car out front yours?      WALTER   Is this your homework, Larry?      DUDE   We know it s his fucking homework,    Walter!  Where s the fucking money,    you little brat?  Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework  extended towards him.      WALTER   Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard    of Vietnam?      DUDE   Oh, for Christ s sake, Walter!      WALTER   You re going to enter a world of    pain, son.  We know that this is    your homework.  We know you stole a    car--      DUDE   And the fucking money!      WALTER   And the fucking money.  And we know    that this is your homework, Larry.  No answer.      WALTER   You re gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.  FINALLY, IN DISGUST:      WALTER   Ah, this is pointless.  As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:      WALTER   All right, Plan B.  You might want    to watch out the front window there,    Larry.  He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to  follow him.      WALTER   This is what happens when you FUCK a    STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.  OUTSIDE  Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like  an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at,  the Dude, who follows:      WALTER   Fucking language problem, Dude.  He pops the Dude s trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes  out a tire iron.      WALTER   Maybe he ll understand this.  He is walking over to the Corvette.      WALTER   YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!  CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which  shatters.      WALTER   YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!  CRASH!  He takes out the driver s window.      WALTER   THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A    STRANGER IN THE ASS!  Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs  bark.      WALTER   HERE S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!  CRASH!      WALTER   HERE S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER    IN THE ASS!  CRASH!  A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over  behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of  the crowbar.      MAN   WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!  He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.      MAN   I JUS  BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!  Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.      WALTER   Hunh?  The man looks about, wildly.      MAN   I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR    FUCKEEN CAR!  He runs over to the Dude s car.      DUDE   No!  No!  NO!  THAT S NOT--  CRASH!  CRASH!      MAN   I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!  CRASH!      MAN   I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!  INSIDE THE CAR  Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.      MAN   I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!         ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:  THE DUDE S CAR  We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as  it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved- in windows.  The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the  road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch   on In-and-Out Burgers.  Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.  DUDE S BUNGALOW  As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four  into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.      DUDE   I accept your apology. . . No I, I    just want to handle it myself from    now on. . . No.  That has nothing to    do with it. . . .Yes, it made it    home, I m calling from home.  No,    Walter, it didn t look like Larry    was about to crack.  He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair  that stands nearby.      DUDE   Well that s your perception. . .    Well you re right, Walter, and the    unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND    LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,    I ll be at practice.  He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into  place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced  against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when  the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the  floor.      DUDE   Huh?  Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in,  kicking the chair away.      WOO   Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie   Treehorn wants to see you.      BLOND MAN   And we know which Lebowski you are,    Lebowski.      WOO   Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk    to the deadbeat Lebowski.      BLOND MAN   You re not dealing with morons here.  BLACKNESS  Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is  a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her  mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.   She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a  beat reappears, rising into the night sky.  MALIBU BEACH  A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried  hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual  attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in  nightmarish slow motion.  WIDER  It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing  kerosene heaters.  1960 s mainstream jazz, of the Mancini- Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach .  In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears   into darkness, descends into light, rises again.  A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach  light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants  and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the  neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and  disappears.      MAN   Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I m    Jackie Treehorn.  INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE  The Dude is looking around at the  60 s modern decor.      DUDE   This is quite a pad you got here,    man.  Completely unspoiled.      TREEHORN   What s your drink, Dude?      DUDE   White Russian, thanks.  How s the    smut business, Jackie?      TREEHORN   I wouldn t know, Dude.  I deal in    publishing, entertainment, political    advocacy, and--      DUDE   Which one was Logjammin ?      TREEHORN   Regrettably, it s true, standards    have fallen in adult entertainment.     It s video, Dude.  Now that we re    competing with the amateurs, we can t    afford to invest that little extra    in story, production value, feeling.  He taps his forehead with one finger.      TREEHORN   People forget that the brain is the    biggest erogenous zone--      DUDE   On you, maybe.  He hands him the drink.      TREEHORN   Of course, you do get the good with    the bad.  The new technology permits    us to do exciting things with    interactive erotic software.  Wave    of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.      DUDE   Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off    manually.      TREEHORN   Of course you do.  I can see you re    anxious for me to get to the point.     Well Dude, here it is.  Where s Bunny?      DUDE   I thought you might know, man.      TREEHORN   Me?  How would I know?  The only    reason she ran off was to get away    from her rather sizable debt to me.      DUDE   But she hasn t run off, she s been--  Treehorn waves this off.      TREEHORN   I ve heard the kidnapping story, so    save it.  I know you re mixed up in    all this, Dude, and I don t care    what you re trying to take off her    husband.  That s your business.  All    I m saying is, I want mine.      DUDE   Yeah, well, right man, there are    many facets to this, uh, you know,    many interested parties.  If I can    find your money, man-- what s in it    for the Dude?      TREEHORN   Of course, there s that to discuss.     Refill?      DUDE   Does the Pope shit in the woods?      TREEHORN   Let s say a 10% finder s fee?      DUDE   Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way    you do business.  Your money is being    held by a kid named Larry Sellers.     He lives in North Hollywood, on    Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.     A real fuckin  brat, but I m sure    your goons ll be able to get it off    him, mean he s only fifteen and he s    flunking social studies.  So if you ll    just write me a check for my ten per    cent. . . of half a million. . .    fifty grand.  He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.      DUDE   I ll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you    mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.  The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.      TREEHORN   A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your    idea of a joke?  Jackie Treehorn s image starts to swim.  He is joined on  either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking  grimly down at the Dude.      DUDE   No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid s    got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just    wanted a car.  All the Dude ever    wanted. . . was his rug back. . .    not greedy. . . it really.  He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.   Tied the room together.  He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.  FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE  Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and  squishes.  FAST FADE OUT  BLACK      THE STRANGER S VOICE   Darkness warshed over the Dude--   darker n a black steer s tookus on a    moonless prairie night.  There was    no bottom.  We hear a thundering bass.  SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:  JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS  ANOTHER TITLE CARD:  THE DUDE  AND  MAUDE LEBOWSKI  IN  THIRD TITLE CARD:  GUTTERBALLS  The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked  by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns   into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition s    Just Dropped In.   The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable  repairman.  The Dude s face is washed with a brilliant light  as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.  In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing  operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an  armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails,  and holds a trident.  The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps  her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.  The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-  skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs  turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the  end.  But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their  legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane,  the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face  down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.  His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little  ball-guide arrows zipping by.  The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so  that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.  Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing  chorines.  The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so  that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward  and his forward momentum blows back his hair.  Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs,  are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,   and rush on into black.  A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless  woman, squealing, her legs kicking.  As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three  men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool  of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding  oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.  The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the  advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.  The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of  car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.   The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific  Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.  With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with  flashing gumballs pulls up.  SQUAD CAR  The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the  motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:      DUDE   He was innocent.  Not a charge was    true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.  CHIEF S OFFICE  The Dude is hurled against the chief s desk, which he bounces  off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.  His wallet is tossed onto the desk.  The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through  it with disgusted incredulity.      CHIEF   This is your only I.D.?  He is looking at the Ralph s Shopper s Club card.     DUDE   I know my rights.      CHIEF   You don t know shit, Lebowski.      DUDE   I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I    want Bill Kunstler.      CHIEF   What are you, some kind of sad-assed    refugee from the fucking sixties?      DUDE   Uh-huh.      CHIEF   Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to    eject you from his garden party,    that you were drunk and abusive.      DUDE   That guy treats women like objects,    man.      CHIEF   Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in    this town, Lebowski.  You don t draw    shit.  We got a nice quiet beach    community here, and I aim to keep it    nice and quiet.  So let me make    something plain.  I don t like you    sucking around bothering our citizens,    Lebowski.  I don t like your jerk-   off name, I don t like your jerk-off    face, I don t like your jerk- off    behavior, and I don t like you, jerk-   off --do I make myself clear?  The Dude stares.      DUDE   I m sorry, I wasn t listening.  The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It  hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee  splashing everywhere.  The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.      DUDE   --Ow!  Fucking fascist!  The Chief slaps him twice.      CHIEF   Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!  He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts  kicking at him.      CHIEF   Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep    your ugly fucking goldbricking ass    out of my beach community!  CAB  The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks  with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his  face and scalp.   Peaceful Easy Feeling  is on the radio.  DUDE S POV  The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds  under a knit cap.      DUDE   Jesus, man, can you change the    station?      DRIVER   Fuck you man!  You don t like my    fucking music, get your own fucking    cab!      DUDE   I ve had a--      DRIVER   I pull over and kick your ass out,    man!      DUDE   --had a rough night, and I hate the    fucking Eagles, man--      DRIVER   That s it!  Outta this fucking cab!  THE STREET  The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car,  oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.  INSIDE THE OTHER CAR  It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and  badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a  dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a  kite, is Bunny Lebowski.  THE FOOTWELL  On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright  red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.  When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.  Five more toes.  DUDE S BUNGALOW  The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed  to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.      DUDE   Jesus.  The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned,  upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.  Quiet.  The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.  The Dude cringes.  Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.      MAUDE   Jeffrey.      DUDE   Maude?  She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.      MAUDE   Love me.  The Dude is stupefied.      DUDE   That s my robe.        THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:  BLACK  After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the  blackness:      MAUDE   Tell me a little about yourself,    Jeffrey.      DUDE   Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.  A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting  himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness  except for the glowing tip of the joint.      DUDE   I was, uh, one of the authors of the    Port Huron Statement.--The original    Port Huron Statement.      MAUDE   Uh-huh.      DUDE   Not the compromised second draft.     And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the    Seattle Seven?      MAUDE   Mmnun.  Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie  next to each other in bed.      DUDE   And then. . . let s see, I uh--music    business briefly.      MAUDE   Oh?      DUDE   Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed    of Sound Tour.      MAUDE   Uh-huh.      DUDE   Bunch of assholes.  And then, you    know, little of this, little of that.    My career s, uh, slowed down a bit    lately.      MAUDE   What do you do for fun?      DUDE   Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.     Drive around.  The occasional acid    flashback.  He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a  pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each  kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep  her pelvis raised.      MAUDE   What happened to your house?      DUDE   Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.     Wanted to save the finder s fee.      MAUDE   Finder s fee?      DUDE   He thought I had your father s money,    so he got me out of the way while he    looked for it.      MAUDE   It s not my father s money, it s the    Foundation s.  Why did he think you    had it?  And who does?      DUDE   Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.     Real fucking brat.  He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.      MAUDE   Jeffrey--      DUDE   It s a complicated case, Maude.     Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately    I ve been adhering to a pretty strict,    uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,    you know, limber.  I m real fucking    close to your father s money, real    fucking close.  It s just--      MAUDE   I keep telling you, it s the    Foundation s money.  Father doesn t    have any.      DUDE   Huh?  He s fucking loaded.      MAUDE   No no, the wealth was all Mother s.      DUDE   But your father--he runs stuff, he--      MAUDE   We did let Father run one of the    companies, briefly, but he didn t do    very well at it.      DUDE   But he s--      MAUDE   He helps administer the charities    now, and I give him a reasonable    allowance.  He has no money of his    own.  I know how he likes to present    himself; Father s weakness is vanity.     Hence the slut.      DUDE   Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is    that yoga?  Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees  pulled in.      MAUDE   It increases the chances of    conception.  The Dude spits some White Russian.      DUDE   Increases?      MAUDE   Well yes, what did you think this    was all about?  Fun and games?      DUDE   Well...no, of course not--      MAUDE   I want a child.      DUDE   Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--      MAUDE   Look, Jeffrey, I don t want a partner.     In fact I don t want the father to    be someone I have to see socially,    or who ll have any interest in rearing    the child himself.      DUDE   Huh...  Something occurs to him.      DUDE   So...that doctor.      MAUDE   Exactly.  What happened to your face?     Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?  The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is  absent.      DUDE   No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.     A real reactionary. . . So your    father. . . Oh man, I get it!      MAUDE   What?  The Dude is leaving the bedroom.      DUDE   Yeah, my thinking about the case,    man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.     Your father--  LIVING ROOM  The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.      PHONE VOICE   This is Walter Sobchak.  I m not in;    leave a message after the beep.  FROM THE BEDROOM:      MAUDE S VOICE   What re you talking about?  Beep.      DUDE   Walter, if you re there, pick up the    fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,    this is an emergency.  I m not--      WALTER   Dude?      DUDE   Walter, listen, I m at my place, I    need you to come pick me up--      WALTER   I can t drive, Dude, it s erev    shabbas.      DUDE   Huh?      WALTER   Erev shabbas.  I can t drive.  I m    not even supposed to pick up the    phone, unless it s an emergency.      DUDE   It is a fucking emergency.      WALTER   I understand.  That s why I picked    up the phone.      DUDE   THEN WHY CAN T YOU--fuck, never mind,    just call Donny then, and ask him to--      WALTER   Dude, I m not supposed to make calls--      DUDE   WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA    GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR    I M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!      MAUDE S VOICE   Jeffrey?  THE DUDE  He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His  attention is caught by something down the street.  HIS POV  A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the  shape of a fat man in the driver s seat.  THE DUDE  Striding purposefully down the street.  HIS POV  The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car s  ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More  whines and coughs; no start.  The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a  newspaper, which he holds before his face.  THE DUDE  As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver s  window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.   He is revved with nervous energy.      DUDE   Get out of that fucking car, man!  The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man s  movement as he gets out.  The man cringes, reacting to the Dude s flinch.  He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a  short fringe and a mustache.  The Dude shouts to cover his fear:      DUDE   Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,    man!      MAN   Relax, man!  No physical harm    intended!      DUDE   Who the fuck are you?  Why ve you    been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!      MAN   Hey, relax man, I m a brother shamus.  The Dude is stunned.      DUDE   Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?      MAN   Irish m--What the fuck are you talking    about?  My name s Da Fino!  I m a    private snoop!  Like you, man!      DUDE   Huh?      DA FINO   A dick, man!  And let me tell you    something: I dig your work. Playing    one side against the other--in bed    with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.      DUDE   I m not a--ah, fuck it, just stay    away from my fucking lady friend,    man.      DA FINO   Hey hey, I m not messing with your    special lady--      DUDE   She s not my special lady, she s my    fucking lady friend.  I m just helping    her conceive, man!      DA FINO   Hey, man, I m not--      DUDE   Who re you working for?  Lebowski?     Jackie Treehorn?      DA FINO   The Gundersons.      DUDE   The?  Who the fff--      DA FINO   The Gundersons.  It s a wandering    daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.     Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.     Her parents want her back.  He is fumbling in his wallet.      DA FINO   See?  The Dude looks at the picture.  It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but  fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and  straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.      DUDE   Jesus fucking Christ.      DA FINO   Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.  He is holding out another picture.  The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.   The family farm.  A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat  snow-swept landscape.  Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it ll make her  homesick.      DUDE   Boy.  How ya gonna keep  em down on    the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.  He hands back the picture.  She s been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she s  definitely not around.      DA FINO   Fuck, man!  That s terrible!      DUDE   Yeah, it sucks.      DA FINO   Well maybe you and me could pool our    resources--trade information--   professional courtesy--compeers, you    know--  We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an  approaching car.      DUDE   Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.     And stay away from my special la--   from my fucking lady friend.  The Dude steps out to meet Walter s car as it pulls up, its  passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and  yapping.  DENNY S  Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in  black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde  hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless  tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless,  and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and  arms.  Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage- swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of  the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.    They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad  and pen.      WAITRESS   You folks ready?  The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.      DIETER   I haff lingenberry pancakes.      KIEFFER   Lingenberry pancakes.      FRANZ   Sree picks in blanket.  The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.      DIETER   Lingenberry pancakes.  WALTER S CAR  Walter s eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the  Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from  the back seat.      DUDE   I mean we totally fucked it up, man.     We fucked up his pay-off.  And got    the kidnappers all pissed off, and    the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,    but he didn t do anything.  Huh?      WALTER   Well it s, sometimes the cathartic,    uh.      DUDE   I m saying if he knows I m a fuck-   up, then why does he still leave me    in charge of getting back his wife?     Because he fucking doesn t want her    back, man!  He s had enough!  He no    longer digs her!  It s all a show!     But then, why didn t he give a shit    about his million bucks?  I mean, he    knew we didn t hand off his briefcase,    but he never asked for it back.      WALTER   What s your point, Dude?      DUDE   His million bucks was never in it,    man!  There was no money in that    briefcase!  He was hoping they d    kill her!  You throw out a ringer    for a ringer!      WALTER   Yeah?      DUDE   Shit yeah!      WALTER   Okay, but how does all this add up    to an emergency?      DUDE   Huh?      WALTER   I m saying, I see what you re getting    at, Dude, he kept the money, but my    point is, here we are, it s shabbas,    the sabbath, which I m allowed to    break only if it s a matter of life    and death--      DUDE   Walter, come off it.  You re not    even fucking Jewish, you re--      WALTER   What the fuck are you talking about?      DUDE   You re fucking Polish Catholic--      WALTER   What the fuck are you talking about?     I converted when I married Cynthia!     Come on, Dude!      DUDE   Yeah, and you were--      WALTER   You know this!      DUDE   And you were divorced five fucking    years ago.      WALTER   Yeah?  What do you think happens    when you get divorced?  You turn in    your library card?  Get a new driver s    license?  Stop being Jewish?      DUDE   This driveway.  AS HE TURNS:      WALTER   I m as Jewish as fucking Tevye      DUDE   It s just part of your whole sick    Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her    fucking dog.  Going to her fucking    synagogue.  You re living in the    fucking past.      WALTER   Three thousand years of beautiful    tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--   YOU RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE    PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell    happened?  He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where  Walter is looking.  THE LEBOWSKI MANSION  Walter s car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he  and the Dude get out.  Both are gaping off at the front lawn.      WALTER   Jesus Christ.  THEIR POV  Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a  little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a  palm trunk.  TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY  Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny,  naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing  into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters  in from a boom box by the pool.  Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and  straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the  length of the hall.      BRANDT   He can t see you, Dude.  We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to  the great study.  Walter s dog follows, stiffly waving its  tail.      DUDE   Where d she been?      BRANDT   Visiting friends of hers in Palm    Springs.  Just picked up and left,    never bothered to tell us.      DUDE   But I guess she told Dieter.      WALTER   Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped    her.      BRANDT   Who s this gentleman, Dude?      WALTER   Who m I?  I m a fucking VETERAN!      BRANDT   You shouldn t go in there, Dude!     He s very angry!  BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--  THE GREAT ROOM  The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His  wheelchair hums as he spins it around.      LEBOWSKI    (bitterly)   Well, she s back.  No thanks to you.      DUDE   Where s the money, Lebowski?      WALTER   A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY    LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE    SCUM, MAN!  The dog yaps.      LEBOWSKI   Who the hell is he?      WALTER   I ll tell you who I am!  I m the guy    who s gonna KICK YOUR PHONY    GOLDBRICKING ASS!      DUDE   We know the briefcase was empty,    man.  We know you kept the million     bucks yourself.      LEBOWSKI   Well, you have your story, I have    mine.  I say I entrusted the money    to you, and you stole it.      WALTER   AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING    YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!      DUDE   You thought Bunny d been kidnapped    and you could use it as a pretext to    make some money disappear.  All you    needed was a sap to pin it on, and    you d just met me.  You thought,    hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone    the square community won t give a    shit about.      LEBOWSKI   Well?  Aren t you?      DUDE   Well. . . yeah.      LEBOWSKI   All right, get out.  Both of you.      WALTER   Look at that fucking phony, Dude!     Pretending to be a fucking    millionaire!      LEBOWSKI   I said out.  Now.      WALTER   Let me tell you something else.     I ve seen a lot of spinals, Dude,    and this guy is a fake.  A fucking    goldbricker.  He is crossing to Lebowski.      WALTER   This guy fucking walks.  I ve never    been more certain of anything in my    life!      LEBOWSKI   Stay away from me, mister!  Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski  out of the wheelchair by his armpits.      WALTER   Walk, you fucking phony!  The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing  the floor like a Raggedy Ann s.  The pomeranian gaily leaps  and yaps.      LEBOWSKI   Put me down, you son of a bitch!      DUDE   Walter!      WALTER   It s all over, man!  We call your    fucking bluff!      DUDE   WALTER, FOR CHRIST S SAKE!  HE S    CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!      WALTER   Sure, I ll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!   ACHTUNG, BABY!!  He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the  floor, weeping.      WALTER   Oh, shit.      LEBOWSKI    (sobbing)   You re bullies!  Cowards, both of    you!  Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the  floor.      WALTER   Oh, shit.      DUDE   He can t walk, Walter!      WALTER   Yeah, I can see that, Dude.      LEBOWSKI   You monsters!      DUDE   Help me put him back in his chair.  Walter moves to comply.      WALTER   Shit, sorry man.  THROUGH HIS TEARS:      LEBOWSKI   Stay away from me!  You bullies!     You and these women!  You won t leave    a man his fucking balls!      DUDE   Walter, you fuck!      WALTER   Shit, Dude, I didn t know.  I    wouldn t ve done it if I knew he was    a fucking crybaby.      DUDE   We re sorry, man.  We re really sorry.  The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski s plaid lap warmer  and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and  batting the dog away.      DUDE   There ya go.  Sorry man.  Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.      WALTER   Shit.  He didn t look like a spinal.  TEN PINS  Scattered at the cut.  DUDE AND WALTER  Each with a beer at the scoring table.      WALTER   Sure you ll see some tank battles.     But fighting in desert is very    different from fighting in canopy    jungle.      DUDE   Uh-huh.      WALTER   I mean  Nam was a foot soldier s war    whereas, uh, this thing should be a    fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an    M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking    tank.  Just me and Charlie, man,    eyeball to eyeball.      DUDE   Yeah.      WALTER   That s fuckin  combat.  The man in    the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy    fuckin  adversary.      DONNY   Who s in pyjamas, Walter?      WALTER   Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch    of fig-eaters with towels on their    heads tryin  to find reverse on a    Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--      VOICE   HEY!  The Dude and Walter look.  Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is  restrained by O Brien.      QUINTANA   What s this  day of rest  shit, man?!  Walter looks at him innocently.      QUINTANA   What is this bullshit, man?  I don t    fucking care!  It don t matter to    Jesus!  But you re not fooling me!     You might fool the fucks in the league    office, but you don t fool Jesus!     It s bush league psych-out stuff!     Laughable, man!  I would ve fucked    you in the ass Saturday, I ll fuck    you in the ass next Wednesday instead!      QUINTANA  He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O Brien leads him  away.      QUINTANA   You got a date Wednesday, man!  Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his  shades, watch him go.      WALTER   He s cracking.  BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT  Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding  his leatherette ball satchel.      WALTER   A tree of life, Dude.  To all who    cling to it.  They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming  from a boom box.  REVERSE  Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in  a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them  orange flames lick gently at the Dude s car, which has been  put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men s  creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles,  parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning  car.      DUDE   They finally did it.  They killed my    fucking car.      DIETER   Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.      KIEFFER   Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.      FRANZ   Ja, it seems you forgot our little    deal, Lebowski.      DUDE   You don t have the fucking girl,    dipshits.  We know you never did.     So you ve got nothin  on my Johnson.      DUDE  The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in  German.  Under his breath:      DONNY   Are these the Nazis, Walter?  Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three  men:      WALTER   They re nihilists, Donny, nothing to    be afraid of.  The Germans stop conferring.      DIETER   Vee don t care.  Vee still vant zat    money or vee fuck you up.      KIEFFER   Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee    sreaten you.  He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the  firelight.      WALTER   Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.      DUDE   Hey, cool it Walter.  Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:      WALTER   There s no ransom if you don t have    a fucking hostage.  That s what ransom    is.  Those are the fucking rules.      DIETER   Zere ARE no ROOLZ!      WALTER   NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-   OF- BITCHES--      KIEFFER   His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She    sought we d be getting million    dollars!  Iss not fair!      WALTER   Fair!  WHO S THE FUCKING NIHILIST    HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF    FUCKING CRYBABIES?!      DUDE   Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal,    there never was any money.  The big    Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase,    man, so take it up with him.      WALTER   AND I D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!  The Germans confer again, in German.  Donny is visibly frightened.      DONNY   Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?  WALTER  S TONE IS GENTLE:      WALTER   They won t hurt us, Donny.  These    men are cowards.  THE CONFERENCE ENDS:      DIETER   Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on    you und vee call it eefen.      WALTER   Fuck you.  The Dude is digging into his pocket.      DUDE   Come on, Walter, we re ending this    thing cheap.  Walter s eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter s.      WALTER   What s mine is mine.      DUDE   Come on, Walter!.  Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:      DUDE   Four dollars here!  He inspects the change in his palm.      DUDE   Almost five!      DONNY    (tremulously)   I got eighteen dollars, Dude.      WALTER    (grimly)   What s mine is mine.  With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.      DIETER   VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR    MONEY!      WALTER    (coolly)   Come and get it.      DIETER   VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!      WALTER   Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.      DIETER   I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!      WALTER   Show me what you got.  Nihilist.     Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.  In a rage, Dieter charges.      DIETER   I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!  WALTER  hurls his leather satchel.  KIEFFER  Watching Dieter s charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling  ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.  He falls back, his uzi clattering away.  WALTER  twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter s head in  both hands; draws Dieter s head up to his mouth, which closes  on Dieter s ear.  DUDE  He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate  kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives  a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his  arms up, evading the kicks.  WALTER  His jaw is still clamped on Dieter s ear.  Dieter draws his  saber against Walter s side, drawing blood.  Walter doesn t react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter  screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws  clamped.  THE SABER  Dieter drops it.  DUDE  Awkwardly circling, evading Franz s kicks.  WALTER  still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and  Dieter s separate.  DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:      DIETER   I FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I    BELIEF IN NUSSING!  Walter spits his ear into his face.  DUDE  The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to  establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.      FRANZ   VEAKLING!  WALTER  draws back his fist.      DIETER   NUSSING!      WALTER   ANTI-SEMITE!  Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter  for the count.  DUDE AND FRANZ  With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to  charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.  As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into   frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.  Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music  screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is  quiet.  All quiet.  Walter, panting, looks around.      WALTER   We ve got a man down, Dude.  With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to  Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.  The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.      DUDE   Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!      WALTER   No Dude.      DUDE   They shot Donny!  Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to  Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.      WALTER   There weren t any shots.      DUDE   Then what s...      WALTER   It s a heart attack.      DUDE   Wha.      WALTER   Call the medics, Dude.      DUDE   Wha. . . Donny--      WALTER   Hurry Dude.  I d go but I m pumping    blood.  Might pass out.  The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand  on Donny s shoulder.      WALTER   Rest easy, good buddy, you re doing    fine.  We got help choppering in.  FADE OUT  HOLD IN BLACK  THE DUDE AND WALTER  ---  They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript  waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off  those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.  A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He  eyes the Dude s bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter s  army surplus, but doesn t make an issue of it.      MAN   Hello, gentlemen.  You are the    bereaved?      DUDE   Yeah man.      MAN   Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet    you.      DUDE   Jeffrey Lebowski.      WALTER   Walter Sobchak.      DUDE   The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.      DONNELLY   Excuse me?      DUDE   Nothing.      DONNELLY   Yes.  I understand you re taking    away the remains.      WALTER   Yeah.      DONNELLY   We have the urn.  He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters  to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.      DONNELLY   And I assume this is credit card?  He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk  to whomever wants to take it.      WALTER   Yeah.  He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit  halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head  pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.   The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a  mortician s smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards  Donnelly, pointing.      WALTER   What s this?      DONNELLY   That is for the urn.      WALTER   Don t need it.  We re scattering the    ashes.      DONNELLY   Yes, so we were informed.  However,    we must of course transmit the remains    to you in a receptacle.      WALTER   This is a hundred and eighty dollars.      DONNELLY   Yes sir.  It is our most modestly    priced receptacle.      DUDE   Well can we--      WALTER   A hundred and eighty dollars?!      DONNELLY   They range up to three thousand.      WALTER   Yeah, but we re--      DUDE   Can we just rent it from you?      DONNELLY   Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental    house.      WALTER   We re scattering the fucking ashes!      DUDE   Walter--      WALTER   JUST BECAUSE WE RE BEREAVED DOESN T    MEAN WE RE SAPS!      DONNELLY   Sir, please lower your voice--      DUDE   Hey man, don t you have something    else you could put it in?      DONNELLY   That is our most modestly priced    receptacle.      WALTER   GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH S AROUND    HERE?!  POINT DUME -- DAY  It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk  towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is  one lonely car, Walter s.  Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic  lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly  for a beat.  Finally:      WALTER   I ll say a few words.  The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears  his throat.      WALTER   Donny was a good bowler, and a good    man.  He was. . . He was one of us.     He was a man who loved the outdoors,    and bowling, and as a surfer explored    the beaches of southern California    from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he    was an avid bowler.  And a good    friend.  He died--he died as so many    of his generation, before his time.     In your wisdom you took him, Lord.     As you took so many bright flowering    young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc    and Hill 364.  These young men gave    their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny    who. . . who loved bowling.  Walter clears his throat.      WALTER   And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,    in accordance with what we think      your dying wishes might well have    been, we commit your mortal remains    to the bosom of.  Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.      WALTER   the Pacific Ocean, which you loved    so well.  AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:      WALTER   Goodnight, sweet prince.  The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing  just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands,  frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.      WALTER   Shit, I m sorry Dude.  He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.      WALTER   Goddamn wind.  Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping  Walter s hands away.      DUDE   Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking    asshole!      WALTER   Dude!  Dude, I m sorry!  The Dude is near tears.      DUDE   You make everything a fucking    travesty!      WALTER   Dude, I m--it was an accident!  The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.      DUDE   What about that shit about Vietnam!      WALTER   Dude, I m sorry--      DUDE   What the fuck does Vietnam have to    do with anything!  What the fuck    were you talking about?!  Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost  lost.      WALTER   Shit Dude, I m sorry--      DUDE   You re a fuck, Walter!  He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then  wraps his arms around the Dude.      WALTER   Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let s go bowling.  THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING  We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow  through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.   They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his  bowling shirt.  BAR AREA  The Dude walks up to the bar.      DUDE   Two oat sodas, Gary.      GARY   Right.  Good luck tomorrow.      DUDE   Thanks, man.      GARY   Sorry to hear about Donny.      DUDE   Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you    eat the bear, and, uh.   Tumbling Tumbleweeds  has come up on the jukebox, and The  Stranger ambles up to the bar.      THE STRANGER   Howdy do, Dude.      DUDE   Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered    if I d see you again.      THE STRANGER   Wouldn t miss the semis.  How things    been goin ?      DUDE   Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,    ups and downs.  The Stranger s eyes crinkle merrily.      THE STRANGER   Sure, I gotcha.  The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.      DUDE   Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I    gotta get back.      THE STRANGER   Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know    that you will.  THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:      DUDE   Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude    abides.  Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:      THE STRANGER   The Dude abides.  He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into  the camera.      THE STRANGER   I don t know about you, but I take    comfort in that.  It s good knowin     he s out there, the Dude, takin  her    easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I    sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp,    that about does her, wraps her all    up.  Things seem to ve worked out    pretty good for the Dude n Walter,    and it was a purt good story, dontcha    think?   Made me laugh to beat the    band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I    didn t like seein  Donny go. But    then, happen to know that there s a    little Lebowski on the way.  I guess    that s the way the whole durned human    comedy keeps perpetuatin  it-self,    down through the generations, westward    the wagons, across the sands a time    until-- aw, look at me, I m ramblin     again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed    yourselves.  He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull  back.      THE STRANGER   Catch ya further on down the trail.  As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his  voice fades:      THE STRANGER   ...Say friend, ya got any more a    that good sarsaparilla?...    ',\n",

CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY   CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide  with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of  the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the  sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on  the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.   A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE S  view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering  to his wound.   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of  view, as they steer him away.      FATHER S VOICE (o.s.)   Come on, Son --this is no place for us.   YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of  FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching  up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture  of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.  SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...      P.A. SYSTEM   Flight 784 for San Francisco is now   ready for boarding at inmate number   66578, Greely.   INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT      PRISON P.A. SYSTEM   --number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...   COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one  of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim  corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.   Then, as he  recovers  from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR  FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF  ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS   REALITY  OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE   DREAMLIKE  THAN HIS DREAM.   Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,  GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.   COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...      COLE   Ssssst!  Jose, what s going on?   JOSE s face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is  youthful.  He s just a scared Puerto Rican kid!      JOSE    Volunteers  again.   JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a  menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms  close to COLE s cage and unlocks it.      SCARFACE    Volunteer duty .      The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.      COLE   I didn t volunteer.      SCARFACE   You causing trouble again?      COLE    (controls his temper)   No trouble.   INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT   COLE s alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit  in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.     TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE   COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.      OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)   All openings must be closed.   COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.      OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)   If the integrity of the suit is compromised   in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper   not closed, readmittance will be denied.   INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)   COLE, wearing the  space suit  and a helmet with a plastic visor,  steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door  clangs shut behind him.  He s alone.  COLE S breath comes quicker  now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.   On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.  COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It   INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)   COLE S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks  down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.   The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.   INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)   COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he s wading through   RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.   The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.   Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.   EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)   A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved  aside.  COLE S helmeted head emerges from below.   COLE S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in  moonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people  anywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE S BREATHING.   EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)   COLE S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.    Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for  something.  Finds it.  An insect.   COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it  into a collection tube, something makes him turn.   There s something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.   COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the  light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.   ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.    Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the  flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.   INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT   Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked  floor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!   The only sound is COLE S labored BREATHING.   Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More  dogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It s a DOGFIGHT!   EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)   A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings  and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.   Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted  buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.   INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)   COLE S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large  SPIDER tries to hide from the light.   COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and  puts it into one of his specimen tubes.   Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There s  nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.   EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN   As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the  building.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.   COLE S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled  logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is  written,  WE DID IT!    COLE looks up.   COLE S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION  patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.     TTTLES END   INT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT   ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the  wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.   INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT   Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on  long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING  FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their  windowed masks.  It s a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,  dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,      AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)   Raise your arms above your head.   COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.   INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)   Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN  in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws  blood from COLE S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.   COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque  window  of thick  plastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk  behind the translucent aperture, studying him.   The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.   INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT   Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.   COLE S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...  a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces  heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with  string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a  dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering  books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference  table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,  BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent  a  modern  science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,  outdated, patched-together technologies.      TINY   James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.      MICROBIOLOGIST   Thank you.  You two wait outside.      SCARFACE   He s got a history, Doctor.  Violence.   COLE S eyes return to the walls.   Headlines:   CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!       SCARFACE   Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.      ENGINEER   I don t think he s going to hurt us.  You re   not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?   COLE S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.      COLE   No, sir.   The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.      MICROBIOLOGIST   Why don t you sit down, Mr. Cole.   COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.      ASTROPHYSICIST   We want you to tell us about last   night.      COLE   I went to the surface and I collected   specimens like I was told.   The SCIENTISTS don t say anything.  They just study him carefully.      COLE    (worried)   I mashed the spider, didn t I?      MICROBIOLOGIST   We ll get to the spider later, Mr.   Cole.  Right now, we want to know   everything that you saw.   INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)   COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard  sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.      ASTPOPHYSICIST   Where you collected sample #4, what   street was that?      COLE   Uh...      BOTANIST   It s important to observe everything.      COLE   I think it was...I m sure it was 2nd Street.   As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,  COLE S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the  wall.  One headline screams,  VIRUS MUTATING!   Another features  a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we ll see again later on)  and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS,  IT S TOO LATE FOR CURE .      ASTROPHYSICIST S VOICE (o.s.)   Close your eyes, Cole.   Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.   BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.      ENGINEER S VOICE (o.s.)   Tell us in detail what you ve seen in   this room.      COLE S VOICE (o.s.)   Uh, in this room?  Uh...      MICROBIOLOGIST S VOICE (o.s.)   How many of us are there?      COLE S VOICE (o.s.)   Six...seven, if you count me.      ASTROPHYSICIST S VOICE (o.s.)   Tell us about the pictures on the wall...      COLE S VOICE (o.s.)   Uh, you mean the newspapers?      A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)   Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you   hear my voice?  What do I look like?   What does he look like, the man who   just spoke?  How old were you when you   left the surface?   The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.  SYSTEM at the airport.   INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY   THE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked  by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE  land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse  leading to the departure gates.      P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)   Flight 784 now boarding at gate...   Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the  monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn  to see what s going on, a man we ll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face  averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago  Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.      MR. PONYTAIL   WATCH IT!   YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and  the man s ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.   Just then, a WOMAN S VOICE cries out,  NOOOOOOOOO!    YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as  TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others  running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks  up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....       TERRIFIED TRAVELER   Just exactly why did you volunteer?   INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)   COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he s facing the SCIENTISTS.      ASTROPHYSICIST   Wake up, Cole.      COLE   Uh, I didn t hear the...      MICROBIOLOGIST    (tapping a pencil on the table)   I asked you, why did you volunteer?      COLE   Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me   I volunteered.   The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.   COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as  the ENGINEER speaks to him.      ENGINEER   We appreciate you volunteering.  You re   a very good observer, Cole.      COLE   Uh, thank you.      ENGINEER   You ll get a reduction in sentence.   COLE keeps his face impassive.      ASTROPHYSICIST   To be determined by the proper authorities.      ENGINEER   You don t want to jeopardize that reduction,   do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?      COLE   No, sir!      ASTROPHYSICIST   We have a very advanced program, something   very different, requires very skilled people.      MICROBIOLOGIST   An opportunity to reduce your sentence   considerably...      ZOOLOGIST   And possibly play an important role in   returning the human race to the surface   of the earth.      ENGINEER   We want tough minded people.  Strong   mentally.  We ve had some...misfortunes   with  unstable  types.      ASTROPHYSICIST   For a man in your position...an opportunity.      BOTANIST   Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.      MICROBIOLOGIST    (tapping his pencil again)   Definitely a mistake!   COLE gives away nothing.  He s in a box here.  He has no choices.  He stares at the tapping pencil.   INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHT   A strikingly  real  world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings  adorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his  glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty  seated on folding chairs.      POET   Still among the myriad microwaves, the   infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones   and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally   small, byte-sized now, tinier even than   science lurking in some vague electricity   where, if we listen we can hear the solitary   voice of that poet telling us,    We are no other than a moving row   Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go   Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold   In Midnight by the Master of the show.    As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE  JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-  eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She s KATHRYN RAILLY.  And  it s her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!      POET S VOICE (o.s.)    The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,   Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit   Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,   Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.    BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET  looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the  beeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,  the glaring POET continues...      POET    Yesterday This Day s Madness did prepare;   Tomorrow s Silence, Triumph or Despair:   Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:   Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where.    INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT   DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.      FRANKI   -- so they get there and they ask the guy   real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets   agitated, starts screaming about viruses.   Totally irrational, totally disoriented,   doesn t know where he is, what day it is,   alla that stuff.  All they got was his   name.  They figure he s stoned out of   his mind, it s some kinda psychotic   episode, so they re gonna bring him...      RAILLY   He s been tested for drugs?      FRANKI   Negative for drugs.  But he took on   five cops like he was dusted to the   eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?   FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed  glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.   RAILLY S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in  strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded  cell with the distorted intensity of a  mental case .      RAILLY   You have him in restraints.      FRANKI   Were you listening?  We got two officers in   the hospital.  Yeah, he s in restraints, plus   the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill   a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.   RAILLY S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks  right at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it s clearly COLE.      RAILLY   That would explain the bruises, I   guess.  The struggle.      FRANKI   You want to go in?  Examine him?      RAILLY   Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...      FRANKI    (unlocking the door)   James Cole.  That s everything we got.  None   of the James Coles on the computer match him.   No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.   You want me to go in with you?      RAILLY    (entering)   No, thank you.      FRANKI   I ll be right here...just in case.   INT.  ISOLATION CELL   COLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid  colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...  and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.      RAILLY   Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.   I m a psychiatrist.  I work for the   County -- I don t work for the police.   My only concern is your well being --   do you understand that?      COLE   I need to go now.      RAILLY   I m going to be completely honest.  I m   not going to lie to you.  I can t make   the police let you go...but I do want   to help you.  And I want you to trust   me.  Can you do that, James?  May I   call you  James ?      COLE    James !  Nobody ever calls me that.      RAILLY    (frowns, studies him)   Have you been a patient at County?   Have I seen you someplace?      COLE   No, not possible.  Listen, I have to   get out of here.  I m supposed to be   getting information.      RAILLY   What kind of information?      COLE   It won t help you.  You can t do anything   about it.  You can t change anything.      RAILLY   Change what?      COLE   I need to go.      RAILLY   Do you know why you re here, James.      COLE   Because I m a good observer.  Because I   have a tough mind.      RAILLY   I see.  You don t remember assaulting a   police officer...several officers?      COLE   They wanted identification.  I don t have   any identification.  I wasn t trying to   hurt them.      RAILLY   You don t have a driver s license,   James?  Or a Social Security card?      COLE   No.       RAILLY   Why not?  Most people have some ID.      COLE   You wouldn t understand.      RAILLY   You ve been in an institution, haven t   you, James?  A hospital?      COLE   I have to go.      RAILLY   A jail?  Prison?      COLE   Underground.      RAILLY   Hiding?      COLE   I love this air.  This is wonderful air.      RAILLY   What s wonderful about the air, James?      COLE   It s so clean.  No germs.      RAILLY   You re afraid of germs?      COLE   I have to go.      RAILLY   Why do you think there aren t any germs   in the air, James?      COLE   This is April, right?      RAILLY   July.      COLE    (sudden panic)   July?!      RAILLY   Do you know what year it is?      COLE   What year is it?      RAILLY   What year do you think it is?      COLE   1995?      RAILLY   You think it s July of 1995?  That s   the future, James.  Do you think you re   living in the future?      COLE    (slightly confused)   No, 1995 is the past.      RAILLY   1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.   COLE looks stunned.   INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING   COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his  ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.      COLE   Where are you taking me?      POLICEMAN #1   South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.   You re gonna love it.      COLE   South of France?!  I don t want to go   to the South of France.  I want to make   a telephone call.   POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.      POLICEMAN #2   Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink   with your act, but you don t fool us.   Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight  overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.   EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY   A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen  prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department  logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.   INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)   Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE  stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,  PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.   As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and  starts inspecting his scalp...      BILLINGS   Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you   got any creepy crawlies.      COLE   I need to make a telephone call.      BILLINGS    (pulling Cole s head)   Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.   Can t make no calls  til the doctor says.      COLE   It s very important.      BILLINGS   What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it   easy, relax into things.  We all gonna   get along fine if you just relax.   COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the  lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.   INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)   COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the  large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where  light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON  COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.   PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily  at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.   BILLINGS is at COLE S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,  a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.      BILLINGS   Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.   Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV   rules, show him the games an  stuff, okay?      JEFFREY    (with a sly look)   How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I d   be doing your job.      BILLINGS   Five thousand dollars, my man.  That   enough?  I ll wire it to your account   as usual, okay?      JEFFREY   Okay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That s   enough.  Five thousand dollars.  I ll   give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.   As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.      JEFFREY   Kid around, kid around.  It makes them feel   good, we re all pals.  We re prisoners, they re   the guards, but it s all in good fun, you see?   COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are  playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.      JEFFREY   Here s the games.  Games vegitize you.   If you play the games, you re   voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.   COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,  THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.      JEFFREY   What d they give you?  Thorazine?  How   much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.      COLE   I need to make a telephone call.      JEFFREY   A telephone call?  That s communication   with the outside world!  Doctor s   discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts   could just make phone calls, it could   spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone   cables, oozing into the ears of all those   poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos   everywhere!  A plague of madness.    (suddenly sly and confidential)   In fact, very few of us here are actually   mentally ill.  I m not saying you re   not mentally ill, for all I know you re   crazy as a loon.  But that s not why   you re here.  Why you re here is because   of the system, because of the economy.    (indicating the TV)   There s the TV.  It s all right there.   Commercials.  We are not productive   anymore, they don t need us to make   things anymore, it s all automated.  What   are we for then?  We re consumers.  Okay,   buy a lot of stuff, you re a good citizen.   But if you don t buy a lot of stuff, you   know what?  You re mentally ill! That s   a fact!  If you don t buy things...toilet   paper, new cars, computerized blenders,   electrically operated sexual devices...    (getting hysterical)   SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN   RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH   BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-   ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...   A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she s helping.      TERRY   Take it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.   Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and  continues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn t listening.  He s  mesmerized by the TV.      JEFFREY   So if you want to watch a particular   program, say  All My Children  or   something, you go to the Charge Nurse   and tell her what day and time the show   you want to see is on.  But you have to   tell her before the show is scheduled   to be on.  There was this one guy who   was always requesting shows that had already   played.  He couldn t quite grasp the   idea that the Charge Nurse couldn t   just make it be yesterday for him, turn   back time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!   This last thought actually penetrates COLE S focus on the TV and  he turns to JEFFREY who s picking up speed again.      JEFFREY   Seriously, more and more people are   being defined now as mentally ill.  Why?   Because they re not consuming on their   own.  But as patients, they becone   consumers of mental health care.  And   this gives the so-called sane people work!    (hysteria again)   WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!   HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!   IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THE   SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...      TERRY   Okay, that s it, Jeffrey, you re gonna   get a shot.  I warned you...      JEFFREY    (calming himself, smiling)   Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.   I got  carried away .  Explaining the   workings of...the institution.   Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a  bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.      TJ WASHINGTON   I don t really come from outer space.      JEFFREY   This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he   doesn t really come from outer space.      TJ WASHINGTON   Don t mock me, my friend.    (to Cole)   It s a condition of  mental divergence .   I find myself on another planet, Ogo,   part of an intellectual elite, preparing   to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.   But even though it s a totally convincing   reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,   hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a   construct of my psyche.  I am mentally   divergent in that I am escaping certain   unnamed realities that plague my life   here.  When I stop going there, I will   be well.  Are you also divergent, friend?   The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.      P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)   James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!      JEFFREY   Staff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now the   geniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!   INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)   COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.      COLE   This is a place for crazy people!  I m   not crazy!   RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY S best  friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit  around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing  the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORS  bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)      RESIDENT #1   We don t use that term... crazy , Mr. Cole.      COLE   Well, you ve got some real nuts in here!   Listen to me, all of you -- I have to   tell you something that s going to be   difficult for you to understand, but...      DR. RAILLY   James...please.  These are all doctors   here and we want to help you.      DR. FLETCHER   Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.   Railly you thought it was...    (checking a file)   1995. ... How about right now?  Do you   know what year it is right now?      COLE   1989.  Look, I m not confused.  There s been   a mistake, I ve been sent to the wrong place.   Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE  is just grabbing a pad and pencil.      COLE   Hey, I m not going to hurt anybody.   FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.      COLE    (drawing)   Do any of you know anything about the   Army of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paint   this, stencil it, on buildings, all   over the place.   COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.      DR. CASEY   Mr. Cole...      COLE   Right.  I guess you wouldn t, this is   1989, they re probably not active yet.   That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,   three billion people died in 1995.   Three billion, got that?  Almost   the whole population.  Of the world!   Only about one percent survived.   DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.      RESIDENT #2   Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?      COLE   Save you?  How can I save you?  It   already happened!  I can t save you.  I m   simply trying to get some information for   people in the present so that someday...    (sees their eyes)   You don t believe me.  You think I m   crazy.  But I m not crazy.  I m a convict,   sure, I have a quick temper, but I m as   sane as anyone in this room.  I...   COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLE S seen  that tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.      DR. RAILLY   Can you tell us the name of the prison   you ve come from?   COLE doesn t answer.  He s staring at the tapping pencil.      DR. FLETCHER   Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?      COLE    (recovering, new tack)   No!  Look, I don t belong here!  What I   need to do is make a telephone call to   straighten everything out.      DR. FLETCHER   Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would   straighten everything out?      COLE   Scientists.  I m supposed to report in   to them.  They ll want to know they   sent me to the wrong time.      DR. FLETCHER   So you could talk to these scientists   and they do what?  Send you to the future?      COLE   No, no.  I can t talk to them.  It s called,    voice mail .  I m supposed to leave messages.   They monitor it from the present.      RESIDENT #2    From the present.   We re not in the   present now, Mr. Cole?      COLE   No, no.  This is the past.  This has   already happened.  Listen...      RESIDENT #3   Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that s   the present, is that it?      COLE   No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...      DR. FLETCHER   These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they   doctors like ourselves?   Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.      COLE   No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I ve been given   a lot of drugs but I m still perfectly lucid.   You have to let me use the phone.  One call!   COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.   INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY   Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS  insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER  lunges for the phone, answers sharply...      MOTHER   Yes?    (listens, frowns, then)   Whaaaaat?   Voice mail !  I don t know   what you re talkin  about. ... Is this   a joke?  I don t know any scientists.   James who?  Never heard of you!   The MOTHER slams down the phone.   INT.  RAILLY S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY   A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically,  RAILLY takes it from him.      RAILLY   It wasn t who you expected?   COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?      COLE   It was some lady.  She didn t know anything.      RAILLY   Perhaps it was a wrong number...      COLE   No.  That s the reason they chose me --   I remember things.   RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.  It s clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY S cool,  detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.      RAILLY   James, where did you grow up?  Was it   around here?  Around Baltimore?      COLE    (lost in thought)   What?      RAILLY   I have the...strangest feeling I ve met   you before...a long time ago, perhaps.   Were you ever...?      COLE   Wait!  This is only 1989!  I m supposed   to be leaving messages in 1995.  It s   not the right number yet.  That s the   problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?   RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,  pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.      RAILLY   James, take these.    (watching him step back)   Please -- I helped you like I said I   would.  Now I want you to trust me.   INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)   MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.      MR. PONYTAIL   WATCH IT!   Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was  definitely JEFFREY S VOICE.   TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN S VOICE cries out...      WOMAN S VOICE   NOOOOOOOOOO!   The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but  doesn t speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!   Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It s  the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he s not injured.  He s  sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his  moustache slightly askew!   A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.  Everything goes white!   INT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT   COLE S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.   He s lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.  Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,  occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of  an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.   His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.   He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.   With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of  bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.   COLE S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single  tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.   ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.      VOICE (o.s.)   It won t work. You can t open it.   Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.      JEFFREY   You think you can remove the grill but   you can t.  It s welded.   COLE checks the grill anyway.      JEFFREY   See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are   locked, too.  They re protecting the   people on the outside from us.  But the   people outside are as crazy as us.   COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along  the window sill.  He s staring at it when he s distracted by a  sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed  just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with  the blade of his flashlight.   ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.   The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.   For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,  SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY S hoarse  whisper, picking up right where he left off.      JEFFREY   You know what  crazy  is?   crazy  is    majority rules .  Take germs for example.   Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get  out of his fist, he can t help reacting to the word,  germs !      COLE   Germs?!      JEFFREY   In the 18th century there was no such   thing!  Nobody d ever imagined such a   thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along   comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I   think.  He tries to convince people...   other doctors mostly...that there are   these teeny tiny invisible  bad things    called germs that get into your body and   make you...sick!  He s trying to get   doctors to wash their hands.  What is   this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible   whaddayou call  em?... germs !   As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to  figure out where to put the SPIDER.      JEFFREY (cont.)   So cut to the 20th century!  Last week   in fact, right before I got dragged   into this hellhole.  I order a burger   in this fast food joint.  The waiter   drops it on the floor.  He picks it up,   wipes it off, hands it to me...like it   was all okay.   No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows  it as JEFFREY prattles on...      JEFFREY    What about the germs?   I say.  He   goes,  I don t believe in germs.  Germs   are just a plot they made up so they   can sell you disinfectants and soap!    Now, he s crazy, right?  Hey, you   believe in germs, don t you?      COLE   I m not crazy.      JEFFREY   Of course not, I never thought you were.   You want to escape, right?  That s very   sane.  I can help you.  You want me to,   don t you?  Get you out?      COLE   If you know how to escape, why don t you...?      JEFFREY   Why don t I escape, that s what you   were going to ask me, right?   Cause   I d be crazy to escape!  I m all taken   care of, see?  I ve sent out word.      COLE   What s that mean?      JEFFREY   I ve managed to contact certain underlings,   evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and   assorted minions, who will contact my father.   When he learns I m in this kind of place,   he ll have them transfer me to one of those   classy joints where they treat you...properly.   LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS!   TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS   FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...   PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the  dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who s struggling to calm himself.      JEFFREY   Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little   agitated.  The thought of escaping   crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly   I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS   BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW   FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING   THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...   COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.      JEFFREY   You dumb assholes!  I m a mental patient!   I m supposed to act out.  Wait til you   morons find out who I am.  My father s   gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY   FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES!   MY FATHER IS GOD!  I WORSHIP MY FATHER.   INT.  WARD DAYROOM - MORNING   ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing  pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached  to his tiny, restrained body.   ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with  crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty  robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.      JEFFREY S VOICE (o.s.)   Torture!  Experiments!  We re all   monkeys   COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes  the seat next to him.      COLE   They hurt you!      JEFFREY   Not as bad as what they re doing to   kitty.   ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles,  eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.      TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)   These video tapes were obtained by   animal rights activists who worked   underground as laboratory assistants   for several months.  Authorities say   there is little they can do until...   The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of  their experiments passively.   ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.      COLE   Look at those assholes, they re asking   for it!  Maybe people deserved to be   wiped out!      JEFFREY    (startled, turning)   Wiping cut the human race!  That s a   great idea!  But it s more of a long   term thing -- right now we have to   focus on more immediate goals.    (sudden whisper)   I didn t say a word about  you know   what .      COLE   What are you talking about???      JEFFREY   You know -- your plan.   As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE S magazine.      JEFFREY   What re you writing?  You a reporter?      COLE    (shielding the magazine)   It s private.      JEFFREY   A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?   Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.      BILLINGS   Yo, James -- time to take your meds.   INT.  DAY ROOM/HOSPITAL - THIRTY MINUTES LATER (MORNING)   ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing:  a beautiful couple romps  in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...      NARRATOR (v.o.)   Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine.   Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys!   ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with  other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen.   ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.      TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)   We ll return to the Marx Brothers in    Monkey Business  following these   messages.      JEFFREY S VOICE (o.s.)   Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business.   COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking.       JEFFREY   Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk!    (big grin)   Key!   JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  A KEY!      COLE    (groggy)   What....???      JEFFREY   Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.   Major load!  Listen up -- try and get   it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan!   Remember?  I did my part.      COLE   What...???      JEFFREY   Not,  what , babe!  When!     When???       JEFFREY    (pressing the key into Cole s hand)   Now!      VOICE/TV (o.s.)   Let us guide you to the stocks and   bonds that will enhance your portfolio.      JEFFREY    (leaping to his feet)   YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS!   NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.   ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a  BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating.      VOICE/TV (v.o.)   A portfolio tailored to your specific   needs and the needs of your loved ones...   ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.      JEFFREY   YES, YES.  ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!   ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go  of the OLD MAN he s helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a  beeper, calling for help.   ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.      JEFFREY   BUY!  SELL!  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!   ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE  KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  Just then, JEFFREY S HAND sweeps the  puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.   ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just  completed the puzzle stares, very upset.   Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a  lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.      HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT   I M GETTING DIZZY.  MAKE HIM STOP!      SKINNY MAN PATIENT   HERE THEY COME!  THEY RE COMING!      OLD MAN PATIENT   FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I GOT FIVE   HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I M INSURED!      JEFFREY   OPPORTUNITY!  DEFINITELY!  A WINDOW OF   OPPORTUNITY!  OPENING NOW!  NOW S THE TIME   FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!  YES!   YES!  MASTERCARD!  VISA!  THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!   ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY  is sending a message to him.  COLE looks at the ward door.   COLE S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.  One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached  to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.      JEFFREY   SEIZE THE MOMENT!  GET RICH!  NOW S THE   TIME!  GO FOR IT!      BILLINGS    (missing a tackle)   God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.   ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  He locks at the door...blurring in  and out of focus.  He looks down at the key in his hand.   ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREY  resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.      JEFFREY   LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!   ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries to  insert the key in the lock.   ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.   ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.   COLE S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don t notice COLE.   ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It won t turn.   A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.      PATIENT   Place to go would be...Florida.  The   keys are lovely this tine of year.   COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  It turns.      PATIENT   Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn t really dead.   COLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  Then, he opens the door.   INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL   Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room  facing several elevators.   A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn t even  lock up from the magazine he s reading.   Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his  back is to the SECURITY MAN.  But he doesn t know how to control  this elevator.  What should he do?      SECURITY MAN S VOICE (o.s.)   Two s not working today.  Use one.   COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.   COLE S POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  He s a big  guy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  He looks exactly  like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!   ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!   Just then, an elevator door slides open.  The elevator s empty.   COLE steps into it.   INT.  ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL   The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.   COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator  springs to life.  The numbers on the indicator over the door  start to rise.  7...8...9.   Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.   Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.   COLE hesitates.   They look at him.  They seem to expect him to exit.   Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.   As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.   INT.  RAILLY S OFFICE - MORNING   RAILLY has just arrived for work.  She s slipping on her white  doctor s coat when...   DR. CASEY, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the  door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.      DR. CASEY   This was in my box, but I have a slight   suspicion it wasn t meant for me.   CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.      DR. CASEY    You are the most beautiful woman I have   ever seen.  You live in a beautiful   world.  But you don t know it.  You have   freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe.       RAILLY    (smiling)   Cole.  James Cole -- right?   She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.      DR. CASEY    I would do anything to stay here, but   I must leave.  Please, help me.       RAILLY   Poor man...   CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS,  sticks his head in the door.  He s upset.      DR. GOODINS   Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of   yours, right?   RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.      DR. GOODINS   He got out.  Took off.  Last seen, he   was up on nine.      INT.  X-RAY DEPARTMENT/BASEMENT - DAY      A PATIENT is being swallowed by a large tube, a CAT SCANNER,     while a DOCTOR in a white coat speaks reassuringly.      DOCTOR   Just relax -- don t fight it.  We have   to know exactly what s there so we can...   The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.   It s COLE!  He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.   The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.      DOCTOR   Eh, excuse me.  Can I help you?   COLE turns and rushes back out the door.   INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL   COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.   A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.   COLE turns to his left.   Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.   COLE S trapped.  A beat.  He attacks the nearest man.  BILLINGS.   INT.  TECH ROOM/PSYCH WARD - SHORTLY (DAY)   RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on  a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense  for more trouble.  One of BILLINGS  eyes is starting to swell shut.      RAILLY   It s just a shot to calm you.      COLE   No more drugs.  Please...      RAILLY   I have to do this, James.  You re very   confused.   RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE S skin.   INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY)   DR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  DR.  CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there.      DR. FLETCHER   Don t be defensive, Kathryn, this isn t   an inquisition.      RAILLY   I didn t think I was being defensive.   I was just...      DR. FLETCHER   He should have been in restraints.  It   was bad judgment on your part, plain   and simple.  why not just cop to it?      RAILLY   Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have   the strangest feeling about him -- I ve   seen him somewhere and...      DR. FLETCHER    (impatient, not interested)   Two policemen were already in the   hospital and now we have an orderly   with a broken arm and a Security   Officer with a fractured skull.      RAILLY   I said it was bad judgment!  What else   do you want me to say?      DR. FLETCHER   You see what I mean?  You re being defensive.    (to Dr. Casey)   Isn t she being defensive, Bob?   But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.      BILLINGS   Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...   situation.   INT.  CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)   DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN,  GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.      DR. FLETCHER   He was in full restraints?  And the   door was locked?      BILLINGS   Yes, sir.  Did it myself.      DR. FLETCHER   And he was fully sedated?      RAILLY   He was fully sedated!      DR. FLETCHER   Then are you trying to tell me that a   fully sedated, fully restrained patient   somehow slipped out that vent, replaced   the grill behind him and that he s wriggling   through the ventilation system right now?   DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.   INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)   Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into  the sky as the airport P.A. System drones...      P.A. SYSTEM   Flight 784 to San Francisco now   boarding at Gate 38...   YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.   MR. PONYTAIL bumps him.   The BLONDE MAN sprints past.  The WOMAN S VOICE calls out!      WOMAN S VOICE   NOOOOOOOOOO!   TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE  running after the BLONDE MAN!  But this time, YOUNG COLE catches  just a glimpse of her face.  She looks a little like RAILLY except  for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings.  She  calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...      BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM   The Freedom For Animals Headquarters   now boarding on Second Avenue.  The   Army of the Twelve Monkeys...      ENGINEER S VOICE (o.s.)   Cole, you moron -- wake up!   INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE   As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM  continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...      UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM   -- they re the ones who are going to do it...   COLE S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table  in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  It s  a beat-up old tape recorder.      UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER   I can t do anything more.  The Police   are after me.   The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...      ASTROPHYSICIST   Well?      COLE   Uh, what?      ENGINEER   He s drugged out of his mind!  He s   completely zoned out.      ASTROPHYSICIST   Cole, did you or did you not record   that message?      COLE   Uh, that message...me?      MICROBIOLOGIST   It s a digital reconstruction of a   message, Cole, from a weak signal on our   contact number.  Did you make that call?      COLE    (angrily)   I couldn t call!  You sent me to the   wrong year!  It was 1989.      SCIENTISTS   1989!   The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  Then,      ZOOLOGIST   You re certain of that?      GEOLOGIST    (before Cole can answer)   What did you do with your time, Cole?   Did you waste it on drugs?  Women?      COLE   They forced me to take drugs.      BOTANIST   Forced you!  Why would someone force   you to take drugs?      COLE   I got into trouble.  I got arrested.   But I still got you a specimen -- a   spider -- but I didn t have anyplace to   put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong   year anyway, so I guess it doesn t matter.   The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing  looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.   Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST  staring at COLE intently.  For one moment, the face belongs to  DR. FLETCHER!   COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.   COLE S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.      GEOLOGIST S VOICE (o.s.)   Cole!   INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE   COLE comes awake with a start.  The room is dark now, except...   a slide is being projected on a torn screen.  It s a picture of a  stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.      ENGINEER   What about it, Cole?      ZOOLOGIST   Did you see it?      COLE   Uh, no, sir.  I...   Another slide CLICKS into place.  Youthful PROTESTERS, their  placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities,  confront POLICE in riot gear.      ASTROPHYSICIST   What about these people?  Did you see   any of these people?   Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the  PROTESTERS.  The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will  recognize some of them later on).      COLE (o.s.)   Uh, no, sir, I...wait!   The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the  PROTESTERS.  In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage  is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.      ASTROPHYSICIST   Him?  You saw that man?      COLE   Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.      MICRO3IOLOGIST    (switching on the light)   You were in a mental institution?!   The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.      ASTROPHYSICIST   You were sent to make very important   observations!      BOTANIST   You could have made a real contribution.      GEOLOGIST   Helped to reclaim the planet...      ZOOLOGIST   As well as reducing your sentence.      MICROBIOLOGIST   The question is, Cole --  Do you want   another chance?    COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.   INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)   The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as  frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Hey!  Who s that?   INT.  CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT   COLE opens his eyes.  Where is he?  Silence as he examines the  tiny cell.  Bare cement walls.  High ceiling.  Same color and  size as the isolation room at the county hospital.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Hey, Bob...what s your name?   COLE looks around frantically.  Up, down.  Where is the VOICE  coming from?  Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...      COLE   Where are you?      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   You can talk!  Wah dja do, Bobby boy?   Volunteer?      COLE   My name s not  Bob .      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Not a prob, Bob.  Where d they send you?      COLE   Where are you?      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Another cell. ...  Maybe.      COLE   What do you mean,  maybe ?  What s that   supposed to mean?      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Maybe.  Means  maybe  I m in the next cell,   another  volunteer  like you -- or  maybe    I m in the Central Office spying on you   for all those science bozos.  Or, hey,  maybe    I m not even here.   Maybe  I m just in   your head.  No way to confirm anything.   Ha Ha.  Where d they send you?   COLE doesn t answer.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Not talking, huh, Bob?  That s okay   I can handle that.      COLE   1989.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   89!  How was it?  Good drugs?  Lotsa   pussy?  Hey, Bob, you do the job?  D ju   find out the  big info ?...Army of the   Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was   prior to mutation?      COLE   It was supposed to be 1995.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Science isn t an exact science with   these clowns.  You re lucky you didn t   end up in ancient Egypt!   INT.  LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE   COLE is strapped on a gurney.  SCIENTISTS hover near-by,  whispering.  The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.      GEOLOGIST   No mistakes this time, Cole.      ASTROPHYSICIST   Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open.      ZOOLOGIST   Good thinking about that spider, Cole.   Try and do something like that again.      MICROBIOLOGIST   Just relax now -- don t fight it.  We   have to know exactly what s there so we   can fix it.   The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube...  reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.   COLE S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber  door is CLANGED shut.   EVERYTHING IS BLACK.  A HUM BUILDS.  THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE  HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR  BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN  HUGE EXPLOSION!  THEN...   EXT.  TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY   DRIZZLING RAIN.  And SCREAMS.  COLE S in a deep trench, naked,  eyes wide with terror. What s going on? Where is he?  SOLDIERS  in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured  COMRADES who ve been ripped apart by the shell that just hit  fifteen yards away.  Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...  in FRENCH.  COLE doesn t know it, but this is World War I!  Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.      SERGEANT    (FRENCH, subtitled)   Where s your mask?!  And your clothes...   and your weapon, you idiot?!      COLE   What?  What??   COLE looks around desperately.  A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being  stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  Machine guns chatter  close at hand.  AAK AAK AAK.  A grenade EXPLODES.  Reacting to the  foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE S ribs...      SERGEANT    (FRENCH, subtitled)   Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut!      COLE   I don t understand.  Where am I?   The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.      CAPTAIN    (GERMAN, subtitled)   How d you get here, soldier?  What s   your rank?  Where are your clothes?      COLE   I...don t understand.      CAPTAIN    (frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)   German!  Speak German!  What are you   doing here?      VOICE (o.s.)    (pleading in English)   I gotta find  em.  I gotta find  em.   Please, you gotta help me!   COLE turns, sees...   It s his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in  the  underground  time.  He s being carried past COLE now on a  stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.      COLE   JOSE!      JOSE   Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?   JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH  PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  SUDDENLY,  SHOTS RING OUT.  COLE goes down.  Hit in the leg!   SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.   Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead  from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.   COLE is reaching for the mask when...   A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.   EXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT   Stunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at the  dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.  MOVING IN we FOCUS ON  a large poster advertising  The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995 .  WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew  Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON...      DR. KATHRYN RAILLY    MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS      MAY 17   INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT   A large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen is  a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in  apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained  by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE  of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY S VOICE lecturing.      RAILLY S VOICE (o.s.)   According to the accounts of local   officials at that time, this gentleman,   judged to be about forty years of age,   appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle   near Stonehenge in the West of England in   April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and   speaking in a strange accent, the man made   dire prognostications about a pestilence   which he predicted would wipe out humanity   in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and   hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the   village, was taken into custody, but then   mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.   WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern  in a pool of light.  She s dwarfed by the giant screen where the  engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing  scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an  audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.       RAILLY (cont.)   In 1841, Mackay wrote,  During seasons   of great pestilence, men have often   believed the prophecies of crazed   fanatics, that the end of the world was   come.   Obviously, this plague/doomsday   scenario is considerably more compelling   when reality supports it in some form,   whether it s the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,   or AIDS.  In addition to these  natural    contagions, there are now technological   horrors as well:  besides radiation,   consider our lurking fear of germ   warfare and its close approximation,   chemical warfare, which first reared   its ugly head in the deadly mustard   gas attacks during the First World War.   ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I  SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..      RAILLY S VOICE (cont. o.s.)   During such an attack in the French   trenches in October, 1917, we have an   account of this soldier...   ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows  JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried  by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears  to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until  the image approximates Munch s famous painting.      RAILLY S VOICE (cant. o.s.)   -- who, during an assault, was wounded   by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the   lines where Doctors discovered he had   lost all comprehension of French but   spoke English fluently, albeit in a   regional dialect they didn t recognize.   The man, although physically unaffected   by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed   he had come from the future, that he was   looking for a pure germ that would   ultimately wipe mankind off the face of   the earth in the year... 1995!   The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.   ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time  he s in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.      RAILLY S VOICE (cont. o.s.)   Although seriously injured, the young   soldier disappeared from the hospital   before more data could be gathered.  No   doubt, he was trying to carry on his   mission to warn others, substituting   for the agony of war...a self-inflicted   agony we call the  Cassandra Complex .   As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,  RAILLY S friend, and MARILOU S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening  attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with  shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.      RAILLY (cont.)   Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,   was condemned to know the future but to be   disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,   the agony of foreknowledge combined with   impotence to do anything about it.   INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)   A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic  Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly   Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is  seated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.      DR. PETERS   I think, Dr. Railly, you have given   your alarmists a bad name.  Surely   there is very real and very convincing   data that the planet cannot survive the   excesses of the human race:  proliferation   of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding   habits, the rape of the environment, the   pollution of land, sea, and air.  In this   context, isn t it obvious that  Chicken   Little  represents the sane vision and   that Homo Sapiens  motto,  Let s go   shopping!  is the cry of the true lunatic?   DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly  disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.       DISHEVELED PROFESSOR   Doctor Railly -- please!  I wonder if   you re aware of my own studies which   indicate that certain cycles of the   moon actually impact on the incidence   of apocalyptic predictions as observed   in urban emergency rooms and...   As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE  CHANG, appear and whisper...      MARILOU   You were great.      RAILLY   You re leaving?      MARILOU   The reservation s at nine thirty --   it s getting late.      DISHEVELED PROFESSOR   Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very   important!      WAYNE CHANG    (checking the professor)   You sure you re gonna be all right?      RAILLY    (smiles, checks her watch)   I ll be there in twenty minutes.      DISHEVELED PROFESSOR   Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand   your exclusion of the moon in relation   to apocalyptic dementia...   EXT.  PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT   A full moon.   COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,   Congratulations  to RAILLY.   She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last  cars left in the lot.   The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.   RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her  purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...   Suddenly, she s grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large  shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.      MAN S VOICE   Get in!   Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the  front seat.      MAN S VOICE   I ve got a gun.   RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and  scrambles in behind her.   INT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT   Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...      RAILLY   You can have my purse.  I have a lot of   cash and credit...      MAN S VOICE (o.s.)   Start the car.   Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes  peering out of the shadows, no other features.   Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.      RAILLY   Here!  You can have the keys.  You can...   He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely  into her ear, his face last in shadow.      MAN   START THE CAR!  NOW!   EXT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT   The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.   INT.  ACURA   Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.      MAN S VOICE (o.s.)   I don t want to hurt you.  But I will.   I ve hurt people before when...when I   had no choice.  Turn left.   As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,  sees him unfolding a tattered map.  His face is lost in darkness  but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the  map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.      RAILLY   Where... where are we going       MAN   I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.      RAILLY    (startled, horrified)   But that s... that s more than 200 miles!      MAN   That s why I can t walk there.  Turn   here... I think...   RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then  boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully  for his reaction.   He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirror  again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features  are concealed by the map.      RAILLY   If you make me go with you, it s   kidnapping.  That s a serious crime.   If you let me go, you could just take   the car and...      MAN   I don t know how to drive!  We went   underground when I was nine, I told you   that.  When you come to the corner,   turn right.   Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.   He s lowered the map.  It s COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty.      RAILLY   Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a   locked room six years ago.      COLE   1989.  Six years for you.  There s the   sign!  Right here!   COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.   RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.   EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT   The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.   INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT   RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily  against the seat.  She says carefully...      RAILLY   I can t believe this is a coincidence,   Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?      COLE   You told me you d help me.  I know this   isn t what you meant, but...I was desperate...   no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.   I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.   But then I saw your book in a store window   with a notice about your lecture.    (sudden pride)   I can read, remember?      RAILLY   Yes, I remember.    (a beat, then)   Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?      COLE   It s the next step.  I checked out the   Baltimore information, it was nothing.   It s Philadelphia, that s where they   are, the ones who killed everyone.    (pointing suddenly, eagerly)   Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?   RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF  and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.      COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)   This is a personal message to you.   COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.      COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)   Are you at the end of your rope?  Are   you dying to get away?   COLE S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.      COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}   The Florida Keys are waiting for you.   COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills  the car.  It s confusing!  He blurts out...      COLE   I ve never seen the ocean!   Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her  professional tone.      RAILLY   It s an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You   do understand that, don t you?  It s   not really a special message to you.   COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but she s probably right.      COLE   You used to call me  James .      RAILLY   You d prefer that? ... James...you   don t really have a gun, do you.      COLE    (cynical laugh)   Everybody s got a gun.  In this city...   He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  FATS DOMINO singing   BLUEBERRY HILL !  COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid s.      COLE   Can you...can you make it louder?  I   love hearing twentieth century music!   Hearing music and breathing air!   As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror  incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the  wind, mouth open,  eating  the air hungrily.   EXT.  FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT    BLUEBERRY HILL  BLARES as the Acura, COLE S head out the rear  window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.   The sign says,  PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES.    INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT   RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his  head out the window.  what can she do?  Just then, while she s  trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER S VOICE breaks in...      ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)   This just in from Fresno, California:   emergency crews are converging on a   cornfield where playmates of nine year   old Ricky Neuman say they saw him   disappear right before their eyes.   COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.      ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)   Young Neuman apparently stepped into an   abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere   in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,   possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim   they heard him cry out faintly but since then   there has been no contact with...      COLE    Never cry wolf!       RAILLY   What?      COLE   My father told me that.   Never cry   wolf.   Then people won t believe you   if...something really happens.      RAILLY    If something really happens ...like   what, James?      COLE   Something bad.  Is that all the music?   I don t want to hear this stuff...   RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.      RAILLY   Did something terrible happen to you when   you were a child?  Something so bad...?      COLE   Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?   It s IVORY JOE HUNTER singing,  SINCE I MET YOU, BABY .      IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)    Since I met you, baby,   My whole life has changed...   Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.   EXT.  ACURA/FREEWAY   COLE S POV:  the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a  lover s moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...      IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)    -- cause since I met you, baby.   All I need is you...    ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.   INT.  RAILLY S APARTMENT - MORNING   Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an  answering machine s message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.      ANSWERING MACHINE   Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych   Admitting.  There was a guy here this   afternoon looking for you.  He seemed   very agitated.  We tried to keep him, but   he refused  n I kept thinking, I know   this guy.  Then, just a few minutes ago,   it came to me.  It s Cole!  James Cole.   Remember him?  The paranoid who pulled   the Houdini back in  89.  Well, he s   back and he s...cuckoo...and he s looking   for you.  I thought you oughta know.   The machine switches off.  The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.      MARILOU MARTIN   It s just as I told you -- my husband   and I had gone ahead -- she never   showed.  That s totally unlike her!      OFFICER TWO    (pulls out his notebook)   Do you happen to know the make of her car?      MARILOU MARTIN   Um...Acura... 92 Acura. ... Also, that   cat s starving!  She would never neglect   her cat!   EXT.  MOTEL - MORNING   The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS  MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.   INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46   The TV is on.  A commercial is just starting.  A catfood jingle.   The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.   ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side  of the double bed, sound asleep.   INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)   GUNSHOT!  YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.   The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and  YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of  the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.   Close at hand, YOUNG COLE S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,      FATHER S VOICE (o.s.)   Son, it s important for your cat to   have the nourishment necessary for   healthy bones and a rich coat.   INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46   COLE comes awake with a start.  He stares, disoriented, at the  CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.      RAILLY S VOICE (o.s.)   Please untie me.  I m very uncomfortable.   COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and  helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.   COLE S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his  impulse.  He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the  dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons.  He pulls a  razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the  bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.      COLE   You were in my dream just now.  Your hair   was different, but I m sure it was you.      RAILLY   We dream about what s important in our lives.   And I seem to have become pretty important   in yours.  What was the dream about?      COLE   About an airport...before everything   happened.  It s the same dream I always   have -- the only one.  I m a little kid   in it.      RAILLY   And I was in it?  What did I do?      COLE   You were very upset.  You re always   very upset in the dream, but I never   knew it was you before.      RAILLY   It wasn t me before, James.  It s   become me now because of...what s   happening.  Please untie me.   Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.      COLE   No, I think it was always you.  It s   very strange.      RAILLY   You re flushed.  And you were moaning.   I think you re running a fever.  What   are you doing?   COLE is rummaging through RAILLY S wallet, pulling out money.      COLE   I ll be back in a minute.   He heads for the door.      RAILLY   No!  Don t leave me here like this!   Too late!  He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.   ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.      TV ANCHORMAN   And in Fresno, California...crews   continue to attempt to rescue nine year   old Ricky Neuman.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to  get loose, tears welling in her eyes.      TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)   The boy was playing ball with four   other children when he literally   disappeared off the face of the earth.   EXT.  MOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING   COLE puzzles over a junk food vending machine, inserts coins tentatively.   INT.  MOTEL ROOM   ANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen.    ----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING -----------------------       COLE   My notes.  Observations.  Clues.      RAILLY   Clues?  What kind of clues?      COLE   A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve   Monkeys.  I ve told you about them.   They spread the virus.  That s why we   have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to   find them -- it s my assignment.      RAILLY   What will you do...when you find   this...secret army?      COLE   I just have to locate the virus in its   original form before it mutates.  So   scientists can come back and study it   and find a cure.  So that those of us   who survived can go back to the surface   of the earth.   RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass  a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.   COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.      COLE   You won t think I m crazy next month.   People are going to start dying.  At   first the papers will say it s some   weird fever, some virus.  Then they ll   begin to catch on.  They ll get it.      RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)   We interrupt this program with a   special bulletin...   RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.      RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)   This report just in from Fresno,   California.  Naval sonar specialists   who were flown to the site...      COLE   I thought it was about us.  I thought   maybe they d found us and arrested me   or something.   RAILLY stares at COLE.      COLE   Just a joke.      RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)   -- an hour ago have been unable to   determine the location of the boy in the   150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who   lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into   the narrow tube claims he heard breathing   sounds coming from approximately seventy   feet down...   COLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again.      RAILLY   Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking   about that little boy in the well?      COLE   When I was a kid I identified with that   kid, down there alone in that pipe...a   hundred feet down -- doesn t know if   they re going to save him.      RAILLY   What do you mean -- when you were a kid?      COLE   Nevermind.  It s not real -- it s a   hoax.  A prank.  He s hiding in a barn.   Hey, turn left here.  Left!   COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.   EXT.  SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY   An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered  bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he  rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.      EVANGELIST    And the wild beasts of the islands   shall cry in their desolate houses and   dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and   her time is near to come, and her days   shall not be prolonged.    ANGLE ON RAILLY S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,  COLE, beside her, staring out the window.   INT.  ACURA/SKID ROW STREET   COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store  fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable  RESIDENTS .      COLE   Where I come from we think of this as Eden.   If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown   food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut   know what they have.  They don t see the   sky.  They don t feel the air!   COLE S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!      COLE (o.s.)   And the ones who aren t hungry are so smug   they haven t a clue.  WAIT!  STOP!   EXT.  ACURA/SKID ROW   On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with  graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.   Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.   COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang  insignias.  We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.      COLE   The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They re here.    (looks around)   Somewhere.  Come on!   He pulls her along the sidewalk.  No question, he s insane.   At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  Then, still  keeping a firm grip on RAILLY S arm, he starts ripping down newly  tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.   RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,  suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...      COLE   Look, I m warning you.  You do anything,   I m going to go crazy -- hurt people!      RAILLY   I m not going to  do  anything, I   promise.  But you need help, James.   None of this is what you think it is.   ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  He s found  another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!   But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.      RASPY VOICE (o.s)   You can t hide from them, Bob.   COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a  voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.      LOUIE   No, sir, Old Bob -- don t even try.    (conspiratorially)   They hear everything.  They got that   tracking device on you.  They can find   you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha!   RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE S stunned reaction.      LOUIE    (touches his back jaw)   In the tooth, Bob!  Right?    (sudden triumphant grin)   But I fooled  em, old buddy!   He opens his mouth wide.  NO TEETH    COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.      COLE   They re keeping an eye on me.      RAILLY   Who s keeping an eye on you?      COLE   The man...with the voice.  I recognized   him.  He s from the present.  He...   COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...   there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS   And further on, another red stencil!   EXT.  VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)   CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,  oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.   COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.   RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,  COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.      RAILLY   James, no -- we shouldn t be here!   COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.   INT.  DARK ALLEY - DAY   Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.   COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!   RAILLY S POV:  TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.   RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages,  doesn t notice the THUGS.   The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.   These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.   RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.      RAILLY   James!  We have to go back.  Those men...   Too late.  While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending,  the TWO THUGS are approaching.      FIRST THUG   Hey, buddy.   Startled, COLE turns to face them.   The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY S purse, yanks it from her.   COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK!  The FIRST THUG smacks  COLE hard across the face with something metallic.   Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn t even have a chance to clear his  head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE S  cheek.  It s a cheap thirty-eight pistol.   RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks  her roughly to the ground.      SECOND THUG   Stick around, bitch.   Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.  RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...   COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG S feet.      COLE   Please!  Please don t hurt me!   The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his  foot for a second kick when...   COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger  man s calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.   The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG  in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.  The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.   Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE  but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage  blows that come one after another with lightning speed.  The SECOND  THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.   Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for  the dropped pistol.   COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw.  The FIRST THUG S head whips  back.  SNAP!  He collapses against the brick wall.   COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley  as fast as he can stagger.   RAILLY stares up at COLE.  He looks very dangerous.  He glances  in her direction as he pockets the pistol.      COLE   Are you hurt?      RAILLY   Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...   As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the  motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.      RAILLY   Is he...alive?   COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man s wallet and a  handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.      COLE   Come an.  We re running out of time.   You can t help him.   As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST  THUG S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.      RAILLY   Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!      COLE   I did him a favor.  Now come on.   COLE, pulling her again, sees more  12 MONKEYS  on the wall.      RAILLY   You didn t have a gun before, did you?      COLE   I ve got one now.   EXT.  SECOND AVE - DAY   The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,  points urgently at COLE.      EVANGELIST   You!  You!  You re one of us, aren t you?   But COLE has stopped and is staring at...   A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.  The sign  over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.   INT.  FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)   Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired,  and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating  leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  Behind them, a large  poster proclaims,  ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO .  Just then, there s  a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see  COLE and RAILLY enter.   COLE looks startled.  It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in  here.  Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY S wrist, he looks  around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.   Bookshelves line two walls.  The front window is blanked cut with  posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings,  photos of animal atrocities.  The fourth wall features the  counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD  SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.      FALE   Uh, can we help you?   COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets  an urgent warning.      FALE   Excuse me.  You looking for something   in particular?      RAILLY   It s all right, James -- it s just a tape.   COLE S eyes follow her look.  It s a tape recorder underneath a  sign advertising,  THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD .      COLE   I, uh, I m looking for the, ah, the   Army of the Twelve Monkeys.   FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.   We have a problem!  the look says.  MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the  counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.      TEDDY   We don t know anything about any  Army   of the Twelve Monkeys , so why don t   you and your friend disappear, okay?   COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.      COLE   I just need some information...      TEDDY   Didn t you hear me?  We re not...   TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.   COLE is pointing a pistol at them.  A TIGER SNARLS.      RAILLY   James, no -- don t hurt them.    (to the activists)   Please, I m a psychiatrist -- just do   whatever he tells you to do.  He s...   upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he s   dangerous -- just cooperate.   MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.      FALE   What do you want -- money?  We only   have a few bucks.   COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  A  BABOON HOWLS with laughter.      COLE   I told you what I want.    (snaps at Railly)   Lock the door!      RAILLY   James, why don t we...?      COLE   Lock it now!   RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,      BEN   I told you that fuckhead Mason would   get us into something like this.      FALE   Shut up!      COLE   Mason???      RAILLY   Jeffrey Mason?      BEN   Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.   INT.  FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)   The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of  the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  They re very  frightened, eager to cooperate.      FALE   Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big   star -- the media latch on to him   because he s picketing his own father,   a  famous Nobel Prize winning virologist .   You musta seen all that on TV.      COLE   No, I don t watch TV.   COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while  RAILLY watches helplessly.  Suddenly, COLE finds something he  thinks he s seen before.  He holds it up.      COLE   Is this him -- Dr. Mason?   It s a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a  phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.      FALE   That s him.      BEN    (very frightened)   What are you going to do with us?      COLE    (stares at the photo, then)   Tell me more about Jeffrey.      FALE    (a helpless shrug to his cohorts)   Jeffrey started getting bored with the   shit we do...picketing, leafleting,   letter-writing stuff.  He said we were,    ineffectual liberal jerkoffs .  He   wanted to do guerrilla  actions  to    educate  the public.   COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on  their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.      FALE   Yeah, that s when he let a hundred   snakes loose in the Senate.      TEDDY   But we weren t into that kind of stuff.   It s counter productive, we told him.      FALE   So he and eleven others split off and   became this underground... army       COLE   The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.      BEN   They started planning a  Human Hunt .      TEDDY   They bought stun guns and nets and bear   traps.  They were gonna go to Wall   Street and trap lawyers and bankers...      BEN   But they didn t do it.  They didn t do   any of it.      TEDDY   Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot   sold his friends out!      COLE   What s that mean?      FALE   He goes on TV, gives a news conference,   tells the whole world he just realized   his daddy s experiments are vital for   humanity and that the use of animals is   absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey   Mason, from now on, is going to personally   supervise the labs to make sure all the   little animals aren t going to suffer.      COLE    (holding up a rolodex)   What s this?   EXT.  FREEWAY - AFTERNOON   In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with  bumper stickers and painted slogans.   I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS ...   FREE THE ANIMALS ... WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?       RAILLY (v.o.)   You can t just barge in on a famous   scientist.  They ll have security guards,   gates, alarm systems.  It s insane, James.   INT.  MOVING FORD/FREEWAY   A ROLODEX CARD with an address on  Outerbridge Road  for  Jeffrey  Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason  rests on a map spread across COLE S  lap.  COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY S at the wheel,  maneuvering in heavy traffic.      RAILLY   If those young men don t get loose,   they could die in that basement.   COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing  cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.      COLE   All I see are dead people.  Everywhere.   What s three more?      RAILLY    (a beat, carefully, a new tack)   You know Dr. Mason s son, Jeffrey   Mason, don t you, James?  You met him   in the County Hospital six years ago.   COLE is studying the map again.      COLE   The guy was a total fruitcake.      RAILLY   And he told you then his father was a   famous virologist.   COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing  Outerbridge Road .      COLE   No -- he said his father was  God !   EXT./INT.  FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)   The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open  highway.  COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving  the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he s not well.  As  the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.  An ANNOUNCER S VOICE  intones over the RADIO...      RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)   This just in:  police are widening   their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,   prominent psychiatrist and author.   Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has   been abducted by escaped mental patient,   James Cole. The two are believed to be   traveling in Railly s 1992 black Acura,   license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.   RAILLY glances at him, sees he s in pain.  She feels so badly for  him.  She wants to help him.  She says, tenderly...      RAILLY   This can t go on, James.  You re not   well.  You re burning with fever.   COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.      COLE   We need gas.      RAILLY   I thought you didn t know how to drive.      COLE   I said I was too young to drive.  I   didn t say I was stupid.      RAILLY   What s the matter with your leg?      COLE   I got shot.  Look -- there s a gas   station up ahead.      RAILLY   Shot!  Who shot you?      COLE   It was some kind of...war.  Never mind,   you wouldn t believe me.  Turn off here.   INT.  PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)   The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY  remain in the car.  She s pulling a gas card from her wallet.      COLE   You were going to run out off gas on   purpose, weren t you?      RAILLY   No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James --   It ll go much better for you if you do   -- but I m not going to trick you.      COLE    (sees the credit card)   That has your name on it.  Give him cash.   RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as  the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.   RAILLY starts opening the door.  Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.      COLE   Where are you going?   She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience  Store appended to the Gas Station.      RAILLY   You can come with me.  I have to get   some things.  Scissors, bandages, some   alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look   at your leg, James.  I m a doctor.   COLE looks helpless, hesitant.  She s in charge...for the moment.   EXT.  CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)   The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  We HEAR the CAR  RADIO but not the engine.      RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)   Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining   engineers continue their desperate   attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the   ant in which nine year old...   COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the  Ford, his pants hanging on the car s open door.  He s staring up  at the sun and the sky.  RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.      RAILLY   You shouldn t put your weight on it.   You need stitches and antibiotics.   Lucky for you it was near the surface.   RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket  while COLE continues staring up at the sky.      COLE   I love seeing the sun.   A beat.  COLE tries to stand up.      RAILLY   Wait -- let me help you.   RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  A beat.  They re very close.  They don t move.  RAILLY looks like she can  barely breathe.      COLE    (leans closer, shuts his eyes)   You smell so good.      RAILLY    (trying to concentrate)   You have to give yourself up, you know.   A beat.  The spell is broken.  He reaches for his pants, then  turns back to her, suddenly grim.      COLE   I have to do something now.  Something   I don t want to do.  I m so sorry.   RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  He looms over her.  He s  cold now, steeled.      COLE   I have a mission.  It s important.   RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she s going to die.   EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT   A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury  cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  Encountering  another AGENT, he pauses.      FIRST AGENT   They find him?      SECOND AGENT   Who??      FIRST AGENT   That kid.  The one in the pipe.      SECOND AGENT   You believe this?  They re dropping a monkey   down there with a miniature infra-red camera   strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich   wrapped in tinfoil.      FIRST AGENT   You re making that up!   ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to  the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.      SECOND AGENT (o.s.)   I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!   A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who   thought that one up.      FIRST AGENT (o.s.)   Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel   Prize!   Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  He doesn t  see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.   INT.  MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT   A formal dinner for forty.  Desert has been served.  DR. MALCOLM  MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.      DR. MASON   Would that I could enjoy this opulent   dinner and this excellent and   stimulating company for itself, with no   sense of purpose.  But alas, I am    burdened  with the sense that with all   this excess of public attention and   this cacophony of praise, there comes   great responsibility.  Indeed, I   practically feel a soapbox growing   under my feet whenever I stand for more   than a few seconds.   While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON S last remark, SECRET SERVICE  AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.      DR. MASON (o.s.)   The dangers of science are a time worn   threat, from Prometheus stealing fire   from the Gods to the Cold War era of   the Dr. Strangelove Terror.   AGENT #3 spots who he s looking for.  JEFFREY MASON!      DR. MASON (cont.)   But never before, not even at Los Alamos   when the scientists made bets on whether   their first atomic bomb test would wipe out   New Mexico, has science given us so much   reason to fear the power we have at hand.   ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.      JEFFREY   What are you talking about?  What   friend?  I m not expecting anyone.   ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.      DR. MASON   Current genetic engineering as well as   my own work with viruses has presented   us with powers as terrifying as any...   ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room,  grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father s audience.      JEFFREY   This is ridiculous.  My father is   making a major address.   INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION   The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.      AGENT #3   Normally if we caught a guy sneaking   around like this with no I.D., we d   bust his ass, excuse the French, but   this one said he knows you...    (smirk, smirk)   -- and, since you seem to have had   some...uh...unusual...uh... associates ,   we certainly didn t want to arrest one   of your, uh, closest...pals.   INT.  LIBRARY/MASON MANSION   COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in  a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the  room.  A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.      JEFFREY    (dismissing Cole casually)   Never saw him before in my life.  Go   ahead and shoot him or torture him or   whatever it is you do.      COLE    (rising)   You do know me.  You helped me once.      JEFFREY    (turning to leave)   That would be totally out of character.   Helping people is against my principles.    (to the Agents)   See, he definitely doesn t know me.  Now,   I m going to go back and listen to my   father s very eloquent discourse on the   perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS   INTRUDER TO DEATH.      COLE   I m here about some monkeys.   Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes.  A beat.      JEFFREY   Excuse me -- what did you say?      COLE   Monkeys.  Twelve of them.   JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE.  Then, suddenly, JEFFREY  rushes to COLE and embraces him.      JEFFREY   Arnold...Arnold.   COLE is astonished.  The AGENTS are, too.      JEFFREY    (stepping back)   My God, Arnie, what s happened to you?   You look like shit      AGENT #3    (dubious)   You know this man?      JEFFREY   Of course I know him.  What do you   think -- I act like this to strangers?   Listen -- you fellas are terrific.  I   thought you were pulling a number on   me.  What a terrible thing if you d   thrown old Arnie out.  I owe you guys   the big apologia!  Mea culpa, fellas.    (turning to Cole)   Christ, Arnie, it s black tie!  I mean,   I said,  drop by,  but, like, this is   Dad s big  do ...vips, senators, secret   service, and...and everything.   JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE S shoulder and starts leading  him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.      AGENT #4    Arnie?       JEFFREY   Arnold Pettibone.  Old Arnie Pettibone.   Used to be my best friend.  Still is.   What ve you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?   No wonder I didn t know you. You hungry?   Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.   Real killer feast we re putting on tonight.   The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.      AGENT #4   These people -- all of  em -- are true   weirdoes!      AGENT #3    (moving to the phone)   I m gonna call in a description of this    Pettibone  character.  You go keep an   eye on him.  Make sure he doesn t do   one of the guests with a fork.   INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION   GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY  and a very disconcerted COLE.      JEFFREY   Hey, nice ta see ya.  Lookin  good!  Hi,   there.  Yes, it has been a long time.   In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and  COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.      JEFFREY    (whispers to Cole)   County Hospital, right?  1989.  The    Immaculate Escape  -- am I right?    (smiling to guests)   Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.      COLE   Listen to me -- I can t do anything   about what you re going to do. I can t   change anything.  I can t stop you.  I   just want some information...      JEFFREY   We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.    (to a guest)   I am a new person!  I m completely   adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It s Armani.    (whispers to Cole)   Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?      COLE   I just need to have access to the pure   virus, that s all!  For the future!   JEFFREY studies COLE.  COLE doesn t just talk crazy.  He looks crazy!      JEFFREY   Come on, follow me.  You don t lock so good.   JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing  back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.      COLE   I don t have time to go upstairs.  The   police are looking for me.  I need to   know where it is and exactly what it is.      JEFFREY    (brightening suddenly)   I get it!  This is your old plan, right?      COLE   Plan?  What are you talking about?      JEFFREY   Remember?  We were in the dayroom,   watching TV, and you were all upset   about the...desecration of the planet.   And you said to me,  Wouldn t it be   great if there was a germ or a virus   that could wipe out mankind and leave   the plants and animals just as they   are?   You do remember that, don t you?      COLE   Bulishit!  You re fucking with my head!      JEFFREY   And that s when I told you my father was   this famous virologist and you said,  Hey,   he could make a germ and we could steal it!       COLE    (grabbing Jeffrey)   Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates   We live underground!  The world belongs   to the fucking dogs and cats.  We re   like moles or worms.  All we want to do   is study the original...      AGENT #4 S VOICE   Okay -- take it easy.  We know who you   are, Mr. Cole.   COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4      AGENT #4   Let s go somewhere and talk this thing   over. Okay? Just come with me...      JEFFREY   You re right!  Absolutely right.  Me s   a nut case, totally deranged.  Delusional!   Paranoid.  HIS PROCESSOR S ALL FUCKED   UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.   AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD  AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.   COLE is like a trapped animal. He s being led down the staircase  now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.      JEFFREY   YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE  ARMY OF THE   TWELVE MONKEYS ?  IT S A COLLECTION OF   NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.   SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN   FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH   THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE   RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF   INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR   GRAND PLOT!   COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the  stairs.  It sounds true!  JEFFREY S so confident.      AGENT #3   Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we ve got him.   Everything s...      JEFFREY   MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT   THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH   VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU VE    PROCESSED  THAT INFORMATION THROUGH   YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND   LO AND BEHOLD, I M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE    ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS  BECOMES   SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY   CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU   KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???   Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free,  shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.   INT.  FOYER/MASON MANSION   COLE heads for the front door, but there s an AGENT there!  COLE  turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way  through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.   INT.  DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION   SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS  burst into the room.      AGENT #4   Did a man just come through here...limping?   INT.  KITCHEN/MASON MANSION   COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen  and look about urgently.   INT.  DEN/MASON MANSION   A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in  front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.      TV REPORTER (v.o.)   These pictures we are seeing are coming   to us live from deep inside the pipe.   You can just make out the metal wall   behind those roots and I guess those   must be spider webs.   MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...      MRS. McCANN   Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey   is going to eat the sandwich himself.   Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.   The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but  the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.   AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW:  the rows of expensive parked CARS.   ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY S photograph appears.      TV ANCHOR (v.o.)   This just in:  Police say that the body of   a woman found strangled in the Knutson state   Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.   As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY S abandoned  Acura comes up on the TV screen.      TV ANCHOR (v.o.)   Earlier in the day, police located   Railly s abandoned car not far from a   building where three animal rights   activists were found bound and gagged...   EXT.  MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)   Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked  luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.      AN AGENT S VOICE (o.s.)   COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE RE NOT GOING   TO HURT YOU.   INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR   COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver s seat,  spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head  slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.   EXT.  PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION   AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.   INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR   COLE eases himself into the driver s seat, tentatively slides the  shift into  Drive , then turns the key.  Nothing happens.   Panic.  COLE studies the shift again.   EXT.  PARKED CARS/MANSION   AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.   INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR   COLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral).  He twists  the key again.  The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!   EXT.  LAWN/MANSION   AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.   SMASH.  The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and  accelerates right at him!   AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past  him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between  two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.   INT.  MOVING JAGUAR   Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.   The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...   COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight.  Steering madly,  he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.   EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT   Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.   AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,  its rotors whipping around.   INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT   COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the  other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.      COLE   LIGHTS!  LIGHTS!   He starts hitting switches.  The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.      RADIO REPORTER S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)   ---when they pulled the monkey out, it   was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped   sandwich.   Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.   COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.   Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.   INT.  FLYING HELICOPTER - NIGHT   The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a  spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.   Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.      PILOT   There!  He s showing lights.   INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR - NIGHT   COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield  wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...      RADIO REPORTER S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)   We don t know what to think.  They   didn t locate him and they don t know   how much longer he can last, that s   assuming the boy is still alive.   A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the  HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!   EXT.  OUTERBRIDGE ROAD   The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.   INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR   COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above  his front windshield.   Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.   COLE S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:  dense woods ahead.   EXT.  HELICOPTER/WOODS   The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.   INT.  HELICOPTER   The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the  forest below with his spotlight.      PILOT   Goddamnit!  Where is he?   The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.      CO-PILOT   There!  Over there.      PILOT   Where?     CO-PILOT   Eight o clock!  He was right there.   The headlights are gone.  Nothing but darkness below.      PILOT   He musta turned his lights of if.      CO-PILOT   Couldn t drive down there without   lights.  We just can t see  em.      PILOT   Maybe he s not driving!   EXT.  WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)   A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,  crumpled into a tree, the driver s door open.   A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as  OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.   The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the  Jaguar.  He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...       POLICE OFFICER   He s not in here.   EXT.  WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT   Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through  underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.   Suddenly, he sees what he s looking for.   The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees  beside the stream.  The car looks empty.   INT.  TRUNK/FORD   Total blackness!  The sound of keys in the lock.   Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight,  looking down   RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.      RAILLY   You bastard!  You total bastard!   EXT.  FORD   COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.   He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.      RAILLY   I could have died in there.  If something   had happened to you I would have died.   COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.      COLE   I...I...I m really sorry.   Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.      RAILLY   What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?      COLE    (getting to his feet)   No!  I...don t think so.  I stole a car   and they chased me.  I hit a tree.      RAILLY   See -- you can drive after all!      COLE   Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I m sorry   I locked you up.  I thought...I thought...   I think maybe I am crazy!   She looks at him.  Breakthrough?  Very calm now, the doctor.      RAILLY   What made you think that?      COLE   Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about   the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn t   sure.  We talked when I was in the   institution, and it was all...fuzzy.   The drugs and stuff.    (horrified)   You think maybe I m the one who wiped   out the human race?  It was my idea?      RAILLY   Nobody is going to wipe out the human   race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody   else.  You ve created something in your   mind, James -- a substitute reality.   In order to avoid something you don t   want to face.      COLE   I m... mentally divergent .  I would   love to believe that.      RAILLY   It can be dealt with, but only if you   want to.  I can help you.   COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.      COLE   I need help all right.  They re coming   after me.      RAILLY   First, it s important that you   surrender to them instead of them   catching you running.  Okay?      COLE    (brightening)   It would be great if I m crazy.  If I m   wrong about everything...the world will be   okay.  I ll never have to live underground.      RAILLY   Give me the gun.      COLE   The gun! ... I lost it      RAILLY   You re sure?      COLE    (showing her)   No gun!    (looking up)   Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!   RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.      RAILLY   I m going to attract their attention,   let them know where we are, okay?   RAILLY gets in the driver s seat...and starts to HONK the horn.      RAILLY    (calling out)   They ll tell you to put your hands on top   of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You re   going to get better, James -- I know it!   ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  An insect!  He  reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,  stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  The  HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.   ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.   ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.      COLE   I love this world!   ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver s seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS  from the woods.  The police are almost here.  She gets out of the  car, starts around toward COLE.      RAILLY   Remember, I m going to help you.  I ll   stay with you.  I won t let them...   She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!   COLE is gone.  Disappeared.   INT.  POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING   RAILLY is being  debriefed  by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.      RAILLY   Then I said something to him about   cooperating and he said he would do   that, so I got in the car and started   honking the horn.  When I got out, he   was gone.      LIEUTENANT HALPERIN   You lucked out.  For a while we thought   you were a body they found down state...   mutilated.   A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.      RAILLY   He wouldn t do something like that -- he...      LIEUTENANT RALPERIN    (interrupts, hands her the photo)   This the man he attacked?   RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped  against the alley wall, obviously dead.      RAILLY   I d like to be clear about this.  That   man and the other one were... severely    beating us.  James Cole didn t start   it.  In fact -- he saved me!      LIEUTENANT RALPERIN   Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can   explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist   -- why do kidnap victims almost always   try to tell us about the guys who grabbed    em and try to make us understand how   kind these bastards really were?      RAILLY    (as if reciting)   It s a normal reaction to a life-   threatening situation.    (suddenly animated)   He s sick.  He thinks he comes from the   future.  He s been living in a carefully   constructed fantasy world and that world   is starting to disintegrate.  He needs   help!   INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM   YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide.   He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he  sprawls on the concourse...      ASTROPHYSICIST S VOICE (O.S.)   Wake up! Wake up!      GEOLOGIST S VOICE (O.S.)   I think we gave him too much.      MICROBIOLOGIST S VOICE (O.S.)   WAKE UP, PRISONER!   INT.  SCIENTISTS  CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT   COLE blinks awake. All he can see are blurry faces hovering over  him, hammering him with questions.      ASTROPHYSICIST   Come on, Cole, cooperate!      GEOLOGIST   Spit it out... you went to the home of   a famous virologist...      COLE    (weakly)   You...don t...exist!  You re in   my mind...      SCIENTISTS (IN RAPID SUCCESSION)   What?  What s that?  What did he say?  His   brain s fried.  Give him another shot!   SPEAK UP, COLE.  WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?   INT.  RAILLY S APARTMENT - EVENING   The TV shows film of RAILLY leaving the police station.      TV REPORTER (v.o.)   The kidnap victim seemed exhausted but   apparently unharmed by her 30 hour ordeal   as she left the police station in   Philadelphia this morning.  So far she   has refused to make a public statement.   RAILLY S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.   A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her  bedroom.  She still looks exhausted   Followed by her cat, she  enters the kitchen area and turns on the kettle as WAYNE hastily  turns down the TV.      WAYNE   Sorry.      RAILLY   No -- I m in a state of hyper-   alertness.  I can t sleep.      MARILOU   Did you take the sedative?      RAILLY   I hate those things.  They mess my head   up.   The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes  the volume up.      TV REPORTER (v.o.)   Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore   woman, James Cole is now also wanted in   connection with the brutal slaying of   Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from...   RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees...   HER POV:  ACROSS THE STREET...A COP keeps watch.      RAILLY (o.s.)   Do they really expect him to come here?   RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the  tea things out.      TV REPORTER on air   And in Fresno, California...      RAILLY    (glances sadly toward the TV)   He s dead, isn t he -- that little boy?      WAYNE   He s fine.  It was just a  prank  he   and his friends pulled.   CLOSE ON RAILLY S FACE... SHOCKED.   ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, showing footage of a sheepish nine year  old boy being led out of a barn by the police.  The cops look grim.      TV REPORTER (v.o.)   Authorities have so far been noncommittal   about whether they will try to file   charges against the families of the   children involved in the hoax.   RAILLY stares at the TV, stunned.   INT.   HOSPITAL  ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT   VOICES!  SINGING!  COLE blinks awake, looks around, confused, then  stares in disbelief....   Crowded around COLE S bed, the SCIENTISTS are concluding a  ragged, out of tune, rendition of  BLUEBERRY HILL.       SCIENTISTS   ---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...   Seeing he s awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.      SCIENTISTS   Well done, James!  Well done!  Nice   going!  Congratulations!  Good for you!      BOTANIST   During your  interview,  while you   were... under the influence,  you told   us you liked music!   COLE, confused, looks around, sees he s in a one-bed windowless  room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century  landscapes.   The BOTANIST responds to COLE S obvious disbelief with a  friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.      ZOOLOGIST   This isn t the prison, James.      BOTANIST   This is a hospital.      ASTROPHYSICIST   But just until you recover your,   uh,... equilibrium.      ENGINEER   You re still a little... disoriented.      GEOLOGIST   Stress!  Time travel!      ASTROPHYSICIST   You stood up very well, considering...      GEOLOGIST   Superior work!  Superior!      BOTANIST   You connected the Army of the 12   Monkeys to a world famous virologist   and his son...      MICROBIOLOGIST   Others will take over now...      ZOOLOGIST   We ll be back on the surface in a   matter of months....      GEOLOGIST   We ll retake the planet.      ASTROPHYSICIST   We re very close!  Because of you!      ENGINEER    (unrolling a document)   This is it, James...what you ve been   working for.      BOTANIST   A full pardon!      MICROBIOLOGIST   You ll be out of here in no time.      ASTROPHYSICIST   Women will want to get to know you...      COLE   I DON T WANT YOUR  WOMEN,  YOU   BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!   Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break  through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the  loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.      ASTROPHYSICIST    (sympathetically)   Of course you want to be well, James.   And you will be...soon.   COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.      COLE   YOU DON T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS!   YOU RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON T   TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN T HERE.   MADE YOU UP!  YOU CAN T TRICK ME!   YOU RE IN MY MIND! I M INSANE AND   YOU RE MY INSANITY!   INT.  PSYCHIATRIST S OFFICE - DAY   CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone,      RAILLY   He not only used the word  prank  -- he   said the boy was hiding in a barn.   RAILLY s talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist  sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.      DR. FLETCHER   He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him   murder someone.  You knew there was a real   possibility he would kill you, too.  You   were under tremendous emotional stress.      RAILLY   For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he   knew about the boy in Fresno and he says   three billion people are going to die!      DR. FLETCHER   Kathryn, you know he can t possibly   know that.  You re a rational person.   You re a trained psychiatrist.  You   know the difference between what s real   and what s not.      RAILLY   And what we believe is what s accepted as    truth  now, isn t it, Owen?  Psychiatry --   it s the latest religion.  And we re the   priests -- we decide what s right and what s   wrong --we decide who s crazy and who isn t. ...   I m in trouble, Owen.  I m losing my faith.   INT.  HOSPITAL  CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT   Alone in his  hospital  room, COLE struggles without success to  free himself from his restraints.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   You sure fucked up, Bob!   Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and  continues his feverish struggle.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   But I can understand you don t want   your mistakes pointed out to you. I can   relate to that, old Bob.   COLE looks around in spite of himself.  Nothing to see but the  walls and the landscape paintings.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Hey, I know what you re thinking.  You re   thinking I don t exist except in your   head.  I can see that point of view.  But   you could still talk to me, couldn t you?   Carry on a decent conversation?      COLE    (blurting)   I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world!   You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?   They don t like that.  That s a no-no.   And when did you say you saw me?   In...1872?      COLE   FUCK YOU!      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Yelling won t get you what you want.  You   have to be smart to get what you want.      COLE   Oh, yeah?  What do I want?      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   You don t know what you want?  Sure you   do, Bob.  You know what you want.   COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  Then...      COLE   Tell me.  Tell me what I want.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to   be topside -- breathe the air -- to be   with her. ... Isn t that right?  Isn t   that what you want?   Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  When he  speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper.      COLE   More...than...anything.   INT.  RAILLY S BEDROOM - MORNING   RAILLY S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  Suddenly, the  bedside phone RINGS.  Her eyes snap open.  A beat to orient  herself.  RING.  She reaches for the phone.   INTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN S OFFICE/RAILLY S BEDROOM   CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone.      LIEUTENANT HALPERIN   Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D..   Sorry to call so early but...   CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone,      RAILLY   You found him?  Is he all right?   CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows  giving an  I told you so  look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop  across his desk, then continuing into the phone,      LIEUTENANT HALPERIN   Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your   good friend, the kidnapper.  However,   the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic   report on my desk that says the bullet   you claim you removed from Mr. Cole s   thigh is an antique...and all indications   are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.   ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,      LIEUTENANT RALPERIN   So what I was thinking was, maybe if I   sent a detective down there to talk   with you, you could maybe revise or   amplify on the circumstances....   Hello?  Hello?  Dr. Railly?   HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.   INT.  RAILLY S BEDROOM/STUDY   Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked.  Then, she  hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly  arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she  finds a copy of her book.  She leafs through it hurriedly,  locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID (JOSE) in WWI.   Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.  Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old  photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!      RAILLY   No!   It s an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in  the trenches.  And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas  mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing...it s COLE!!!   INT.  SCIENTISTS  CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT   Clean shaven, clear eyed, COLE sits before the frowning SCIENTISTS.      ASTROPHYSICIST   The food, the sky, the certain, uh,   sexual temptations -- you haven t   become  addicted  have you, Cole?  To   that  dying  world       COLE   No, sir!  I just want to do my part.   To get us back on top...in charge of   the planet.  And I have the experience,   I know who the people are...      BIOLOGIST   He really is the most qualified...      GEOLOGIST   But all that... behavior ...      ASTROPHYSICIST    (to Cole, a little hurt)   You said we weren t  real,  Cole...      COLE   Well, sir, I don t think the human mind   was built to exist in two different...   whatever you call it... dimensions.    It s stressful, you said it yourselves,   it gets you confused.  You don t know   what s real and what s not.      MICROBIOLOGIST   But you know what s real now?      COLE   Yes, sir.   The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves      GEOLOGIST   He d have to bone up, catch up to our   research, the latest clues...      ZOOLOGIST   He s proved to be a quick study...   The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.      ASTROPHYSICIST   You can t trick us, you know.  It   wouldn t work.      BIOLOGIST   And why would you want to?  It ll be   dangerously close to the end.      COLE   I understand.  There d be no point.      ASTROPHYSICIST   We re going to think about it, Cole.   Among ourselves.  We ll get back to you.   INT.  DR. MASON S OFFICE - DAY   Standing in front of a wall of glass in his office, overlooking a  hi-tech lab below where WORKERS in white  space suits  work  methodically, DR. MASON speaks angrily into a phone.  His male  ASSISTANT, whose features we don t see, stops writing a formula  on a blackboard and listens.      DR. MASON   You have reason to believe that my son   may be planning to do what?!!!   INT.  RAILLY S APARTMENT/STUDY   RAILLY, trying to stay calm, is talking to Dr. Mason on the phone.      RAILLY   Please, I know it sounds insane but...   INT.  DR. MASON S OFFICE   Dr. Mason on the phone.      DR. MASON    (into the phone)   I m afraid this doesn t seem very   professional to me, in fact it s   distressingly unprofessional for some-   one who treated my son briefly (if   indeed you actually are who you say you   are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest   in his mental health six years later,   and to telephone a parent to express   opinions that would be inappropriate...    (breaks off, listens, then)   I don t know anything about  Monkey   armies , Doctor.  Nothing whatsoever.   If my son ever was involved in...    (listens, then,)   It would be doubly inappropriate to   discuss matters of security with you,   Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at   ease, neither my son nor any other   unauthorized person has access to any   potentially dangerous organisms in this   laboratory.  Thank you for your concern.   DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares.      DR. MASON S ASSISTANT (o.s.)   Dr.  Kathryn  Railly????      DR. MASON   The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by   that man who broke into my house.  She   seems to have been suddenly struck by   the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.      DR. MASON S ASSISTANT (o.s.)   I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic   visions.   We see Dr. Mason s ASSISTANT now.  It s DR. PETERS, the red-  haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn t have to be  insane to think the world was coming to an end.      DR. PETERS (cont.)   Has she succumbed to her own   theoretical... disease ?   But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.      DR. MASON   Given the nature of our work, we can t ever   be careful enough.  I think we should review   our security procedures, perhaps upgrade them.   INT.  SCIENTISTS  CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT   COLE is facing the BOTANIST who s using a pointer to indicate  various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall.      BOTANIST   Let s consider again our current   information -- if the symptoms were   first detected in Philadelphia on June   28, 1995, that makes us know that...?      COLE   It was released in Philadelphia,   probably on June 14, 1995.      BOTANIST   And it appeared sequentially after that   in...?   With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him  from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,      COLE   San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de   Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,   Bangkok, then Peking.      BOTANIST   Meaning...???      COLE   That the virus was taken from Philadelphia   to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,   Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,   Bangkok, then Peking.      BOTANIST   And your only goal is...???      COLE   To find out where the virus is so a   qualified scientist can travel back into   the past and study the original virus.      BOTANIST   So that...???      COLE   Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed   that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim   the surface of the earth.   COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the  BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects...   a magazine photo of wall graffiti:   ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE  WATCHING!  IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE SOURCE?  3 BILLION DIE?       BOTANIST (o.s.)   This is from a magazine printed in late   September, 1995.  The writer speculated   that this graffiti might be related to   the epidemic that by that time had   already killed thirty million people   world-wide and was getting worse.  He   says, certain people, unnamed, were   questioned, but what came of that is not   known.  But it is a clue you should pursue.   COLE stares at the picture.   EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT - DAY   LOUD BANGING!  The storefront window, completely covered with  posters, quivers violently.  Images of MONKEYS covered with  electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into  tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  It s RAILLY.      RAILLY   IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS   SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU RE IN THERE,   I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.   INT.  FAA STORE   JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY S youthful cohorts, SANDY  and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons  as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.      FALE   It s the kidnap woman -- the one who   was with the guy who tied us up.      BEN   What s she doing?      FALE   She s drawing attention to us, that s   what she s doing. ... I don t know what   you re up to this time, Mason, but   you re gonna get us in deep shit!      JEFFREY   Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie   talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies.   EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT   From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she,  seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.      RAILLY   I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I   KNOW YOU RE IN THERE!      RASPY VOICE (o.s)   Secret experiments!   RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.      LOUIE   That s what they do -- secret weird stuff!      RAILLY   You!  I know you!   But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.      LOUIE   Not just on them.  Do  em on people,   too -- down at the shelters.  Feed  em   chemicals  n take pictures of  em.      RAILLY   Have you seen James Cole?  The man...?      LOUIE   They re watchin  you.  Takin  pictures.   RAILLY follows his look.   ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES  COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.      RAILLY   The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to   talk to James, but he has to be careful   how he contacts me.  He mustn t get   caught.  Do you understand me?      LOUIS   Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who s James?      RAILLY   He was with me, he spoke to you.   Several weeks ago.  He said you were   from the future...watching him.   LOUIS gives her a look that says,  I m outta here!    But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously   tagging  their way along the street with cans of spray paint.   RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.   INT.  FAA STORE   FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY,  and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening  between posters at the front window.      JEFFREY   You get the bolt cutters?      KWESKIN   One dozen.  They re in the van.      FALE   One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you   gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?      JEFFREY    (grins)   You really want to know?      FALE   No!  Absolutely not. Don t tell me anything.      BEN   Hey!  Do you know what she s doing?   Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who s peeking outside.   Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look.   POV THROUGH SLIT:  a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front  of the store!      TEDDY   What s it say?      BEN   I can t see it.      JEFFREY    (erupting)   WHY DON T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN   PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT   HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.      FALE    (spinning around)   Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say,    your psychiatrist ?      JEFFREY   Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about   flashlights?  How many flashlights...?      FALE   That woman is...was...your...   psychiatrist?  And now she s spray-   painting our building?   EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE   ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY,  amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting.  He shakes his head wearily.   ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with  amazement, too.  They include...   an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...   a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...   an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...   the TEENAGED PUNKS...   a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS,  reacting at the sight of RAILLY.  It s COLE!  He pushes toward her.      COLE   Kathryn!   RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.      RAILLY   James!   With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes  urgent charge of the situation.      RAILLY   James!  That s a policeman.  Pretend   you don t know me.  If he sees you...      COLE    (turning, looking)   No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?    (placing his hands on his head)   Don t worry -- it s all okay now.  I m   not crazy any more!  I mean, I am   crazy, mentally divergent, actually,   but I know it now and I want you to   help me.  I want to get well...   ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE S hands off his head as  she tries to block the COP S view of COLE.      RAILLY   James -- put your hands down and listen   to me.  Things have changed!   ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on  his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike:  she  tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull  him along...but COLE isn t moving.  He s staring at the front of  the FAA Store with disbelief!      RAILLY   James, come on!  We have to get out of here!   COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,  then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:     ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!    IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE    SOURCE?  THREE BILLION DIE?   It s the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!      COLE   I ve seen that...before.   But RAILLY S total attention is on their dilemma.      RAILLY   James, trust me.  We re in terrible   trouble.  We have to run.   Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past  ONLOOKERS.  She looks crazier than he does.   ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost  colliding with a passing car.  BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.   INT.  FAA STORE - DAY   ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.      BEN   Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her   and some other guy I can t see.      FALE   Hey, no problem, it s probably just   another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey s   shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.    (indicating Jeffrey to the others)   This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic   who told his former psychiatrist all his   plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible   schemes, and now who knows what she s   painted out there on our wall?      JEFFREY   WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON   WALLS?    (moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)   You think I told her about the Army of   the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why,   you pathetically ineffectual and   pusillanimous  pretend-friend-to-   animals ?!  I ll tell you why:  because   when I had anything to do with her six   years ago, there was no such thing -- I   hadn t even thought of it yet!      FALE    (triumphant)   Then how come she knows what s going on?   JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a  supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.      JEFFREY   Here s my theory on that.  While I was   institutionalized, my brain was studied   exhaustively in the guise of mental health.   I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied   thoroughly.  Then, everything about me   was entered into a computer where they   created a model of my mind.   They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY.  Is he  serious?  Is he crazy?  Doesn t matter -- he s charismatic.      JEFFREY (cont.)   Then, using the computer model, they   generated every thought I could possibly   have in the next, say ten years, which   they then filtered through a probability   matrix to determine everything I was   going to do in that period.  So you   see, she knew I was going to lead the   Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the   pages of history before it ever even   occurred to me.  She knows everything   I m ever going to do before I know it   myself.  How about that?   JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE S flabbergasted face.      JEFFREY   Now I have to get going -- do my part.   You guys check all this stuff out and   load up the van.  Make sure you have   everything.  I m outta here.   JEFFREY exits.  The others stare at the door.      FALE   He s seriously crazy -- you know that.   EXT.  SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY   An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.   The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES  COP S eyes searching everywhere.   Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY S eyes peer up out of the  torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.   HER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,      RAILLY   James!  Come on.   A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,  bits of lettuce in his hair.      COLE   I don t understand what we re doing.       RAILLY    (climbing out of the dumpster)   We re avoiding the police until I   can....talk to you.      COLE    (climbing out after her)   You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn,   those words on the wall -- I ve seen   them before...  I...I...dreamed them.   But she s not listening.  She s peeking out the alley entrance.   RAILLY S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,  THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.   INT.  GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER   The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often,  stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.      DESK CLERK   Twenty five bucks an hour.      RAILLY   An hour?!      DESK CLERK   You want quarter hours, go someplace else.      RAILLY    (catches on, pulls out her last bills)   Here s ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal?   The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  Then, he  turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.      DESK CLERK   Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right.   Elevator s busted.   RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs  passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas  chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.   ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb  stairs.  As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone,  punches a number, speaks into the phone.      DESK CLERK   Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe.   You know if Wallace has a new girl?   Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde?   INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY)   COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY  pace back and forth like a mad woman.      RAILLY   Okay...you were standing there looking   at the moon...you were eating grass...   then what?      COLE   I thought I was in...prison again.      RAILLY   Just like that?  You were in prison?      COLE   No, not really.  It s...it s in my   mind.  Like you said.      RAILLY   You disappeared!  One minute you were   there, the next minute you were gone.   Did you run through the woods?      COLE   I don t know -- I don t remember.      RAILLY   The boy in the well.  How did you know   that was just a hoax?      COLE   It was?  I didn t...know.      RAILLY   James, you said he was hiding in the barn...      COLE   I think I saw a TV show like that when   I was a kid.  Where a boy...      RAILLY   IT WASN T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!   COLE looks at her.  She s really upset.      COLE   Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV   show and copied it.  Listen, you were   right, it s all in my head.  I m mentally   ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know   they re not real, I can trick them, make   them do what I want.  I just worked on   them in my head and I got back here.  I   can get better.  I can stay here.   RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.   It s the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in  WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,      RAILLY   What does this mean to you?      COLE   ...I had a dream about...something   like that.      RAILLY   You had a bullet from World War One in   your leg, James!  How did it get there?      COLE   You said I had delusions -- that I   created a world -- you said you could   explain everything...      RAILLY   Well, I can t. ... I mean...I m trying   to.  I can t believe that everything we   do or say has already happened, that we   can t change what s going to happen,   that I m one of the three billion   people who are going to die...soon.   COLE stands, moves close to her.      COLE   I want to be here.  In this time.  With   you.  I want to become...become a whole   person.  I want this to be the present.   I want the future to be unknown.      RAILLY    (sudden hopeful idea!)   James...do you remember...six years   ago...you had a phone number!  You   tried to call and...   WHAM!  The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not  holding.  A menacing figure stands in the doorway.  WALLACE.  A  wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.   COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks  them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.      WALLACE   This is my territory, bitch!      COLE    (confused, turns to Railly)   Is this real -- or is this one of my   delusions?      RAILLY   This is definitely real:    (to Wallace)   Excuse me, I think we have a little   misunderstanding here...   WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face.  She flies back against the  wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is  stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife      WALLACE   What re you -- some kind of tough guy?   You wanna be a hero?  You gonna try and   mess with me?  Come on...   A beat.  COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around  WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.      WALLACE   Now that s a smart boy.  But you,   honey, you think you can go  round   me and peddle your fancy ass in this   part of town, you bet your life we got   what I would call a major goddamn   misunderstandin .   RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs  her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face  with it, then grabs the pimp s arm and SNAPS it like it was a  twig!  The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain  and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves  the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE S neck.      RAILLY   JAMES -- DON T!   COLE hesitates.      WALLACE    (eyes bulging)   You...heard...her.  Don t do it, man.      RAILLY    (gets up, looks around)   Put him in the closet, ... But get his   money first.      COLE    (amazed)   You want me to rob him?      RAILLY   I...I...We need cash, James.   A shadow.  RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE  disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...      SHOUTS (o.s.)   They re killing him!  Call the cops.   Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his  pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.      WALLACE   You two are crazy.  I got friends.  You   put me in a closet, they re gonna be   really pissed.   COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.   HER POV:  A fire escape leads down into an alley.   RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the  bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.      RAILLY   James, no!   INT.  BATHROOM      RAILLY S VOICE (from the other room)    (rattling the door knob)   James, what are you doing?   WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.      WALLACE   I have friends, man -- if you cut me...   WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don t see!      WALLACE   What...the...fuck..are you doing???   INT.  GLOBE MOTEL ROOM 44   RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it  opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping  with blood.      RAILLY   Oh, my God, James.  Did you kill him?   COLE shakes his head  no  as blood oozes from his mouth.      COLE   Just...just in case.  In case I m not   crazy...    (holds up two bloody molars)   That s how they find us.  By our teeth.    (a beat, eye contact)   I don t want them to find me.  Ever.  I   don t want to go back.   RAILLY s astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the  choice he s made.  Given up the future (if it exists, and it s  looking like it does)!  Risking his life to be with her!  For  this brief time!  She s overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears  welling in her eyes.  But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and  feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.   INT.  STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL   COPS  boots THUNDER up the stairwell.   INT.  ROOM 44/GLOBE HOTEL   In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as  COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.      RAILLY   Push it tight!      WALLACE S VOICE (from the bathroom)   NO PROBLEM!  I LL JUST STAY IN HERE!   DON T WORRY ABOUT ME.   INT.  4TH FLOOR HALLWAY/GLOBE HOTEL   POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious  entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.   Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into  their doorways.   EXT.  GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY   COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.  They come to the end of the metal stairway.  It s a long distance  to the ground.  COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.   She lets herself down to him.  Their eyes meet.  He holds her in  his arms for a moment.  Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.  They start running down the alley.   INT.  GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY   The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall  alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  The UNIFORMED OFFICERS  are backing him up, weapons drawn.      PLAINCLOTHES COP   POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND   COME OUTTA THERE!   No response.   INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44   The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol  extended in both hands.  He pans the gun around the empty room.   HIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor.      WALLACE S VOICE (from the bathroom)   HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I M AN INNOCENT   VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A   COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!   EXT.  BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON   A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the  toney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks  furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She s hidden her  bruised eye behind sun glasses; he s holding a bloody  handkerchief to his mouth.   As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling  city, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up.   COLE S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building  with a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!   ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed  entrance to a store.      RAILLY   Wait here.  I m going to try that phone   number.  Let s hope it s nothing!   Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches  her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made  intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES  looming frighteningly close.   A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display  window.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away   Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size  toy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.   COLE S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into  the phone.   ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a  panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares  at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating  BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,  eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.      RAILLY   James!  James!  It s okay.  We re   insane!  We re crazy!   COLE doesn t know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.      RAILLY   It s a Carpet Cleaning Company...      COLE   A Carpet Cleaning Company?      RAILLY    (laughing)   No superiors!  No scientists.  No   people from the future.  It s just a   Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have   voice mail -- you leave a message   telling them when you want your carpet   cleaned.      COLE   You... you left them a message?       RAILLY    (impishly)   I couldn t resist.  I was so relieved.   Wait ll they hear this nutty woman   telling them...they better watch out   for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...   Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he  realizes the truth!  He starts to recite...      COLE    The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --   they re the ones who are going to do   it.  I can t do anything more.  The   police are watching me.    Now she s stunned.  She glances back and sees the phone booth  twenty yards away.      RAILLY   You... you couldn t have heard me.      COLE   They got your message, Kathryn.  They   played it for me.  It was a bad   recording...distorted.  I didn t   recognize your voice.   RAILLY S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.   ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE  CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.  Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him  into the CROWD.      RAILLY   Come on.   INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM   RAILLY, whose sun glasses don t really hide her bruised eye, adds  a man s Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men s things heaped  on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.      RAILLY   And this.    (turning)   Anything else?   But COLE S not here.  He s a short distance away...staring.   COLE S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of  brand new consumer goods.   ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and  full of moldering merchandise.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.      RAILLY   I guess that s it.      CLERK   Shall I put this on your account, Ma am?      RAILLY    (producing Wallace s roll of bills)   No -- I ll pay cash.   The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!      RAILLY   What floor are the wigs on, please?   EXT.  PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT   Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a  PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered  street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.   INT.  PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN   The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among  them, all wearing black.  Some of them have climbing gear, tool  belts, all sorts of paraphernalia.  KWESKIN is telling his story.      KWESKIN   So then he goes into this incredible riff   about how his shrink, like, replicated   his brain while he was in the nut house.   Turned it into a computer.      WELLER   And Fale believed it?      KWESKIN   Oh, you know Fale!  He s like,  If you   guys get nailed -- and I m sure you will --   I never saw you before in nay life!    LAUGHTER from all of them.  Then, there s a sharp, rhythmic  series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.   POPE quickly slides the door open.  It s JEFFREY...grinning.   Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of  the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.   The van occupants react with murmurs of  Awwwwwright  and  Far  out , then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.   Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.      JEFFREY   Let s do it!   EXT.  VAN/FREEWAY   The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.   INT.  PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING   The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a  flashlight and goes over  the plan  with the other ACTIVISTS.      JEFFREY   Okay, that s Stage One.  In Stage Two,   Monkey Four is over here...   A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.      GOINES   What s the harm in opening the bag?   His eyes are taped.      SANDY   Yeah, it s cruel leaving him like that.      JEFFREY   Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.      ICHIOKA   So why should we be like him?   Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing  DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.      JEFFREY   Want the full effect?   Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father s mouth.      DR. MASON   Jeffrey?  I know it s you, Jeffrey.  I   recognize your voice.   JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.      DR. MASON   JEFFREY???  ... Very well.  You re out   of your mind, Jeffrey.  I know all   about your insane plan.  That woman --   your psychiatrist -- she told me.   JEFFREY raises his eyebrows.  This he hadn t expected.      DR. MASON   I didn t believe her -- it seemed too crazy   even for you.  But, just in case, I took steps   to make sure you couldn t do it.  I took myself   out of the loop!  I don t have the code any   more.  I don t have access to the virus.  So,   go ahead -- torture me, but you can t extract   anything of use to yourself.   The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.      JEFFREY   What...virus?      DR. MASON    (spins his head toward Jeffrey)   She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew   you were going to try this.      JEFFREY   What virus are we talking about, Dad?      DR. MASON   You re insane, Jeffrey.      JEFFREY   You  develop  viruses and you re calling   me insane?  Typical.  What does this   virus attack?  Don t tell me, you sick   fuck, it doesn t matter.    (to the others)   Have I ever  developed  a virus?  Do I   put helpless animals in cages and measure   their reactions to electrical stimuli?   Do I inject radioactive substances into   living creatures and examine their   bowel movements?  Wow!  And I m crazy!      DR. MASON   Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly   are you going to do?  I don t have to   tell you I m afraid.      JEFFREY   THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU RE   OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.   GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS   HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED   FUCKING MANIAC?   INT.  MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT   Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward.  It s DAYTIME in Muir Woods.  SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE  (KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a  redwood tree.  We re watching Hitchcock s VERTIGO.      SCOTTY (up on the screen)   Here s a cross section of one of the   old trees that s been cut down.   They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,   BIRTH OF CHRIST ,  DISCOVERY OF AMERICA ,  MAGNA CARTA SIGNED ,   1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS , and  1930 TREE CUT DOWN .   ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the  flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.   ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.      MADELINE (up on the screen)   Somewhere in here I was born.  And here   -- I die.  There s only a moment for   you.  You don t notice.   ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the  theater.  WE CAN T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES      RAILLY   Here, let me help you.   The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the  screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she s  doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.      COLE   I think I ve seen this movie before.   When I was a kid.  It was on TV.      RAILLY    (fussing with his upper lip)   Shh -- don t talk.  Hold still.      COLE    (moving his head to see the film)   I have seen it, but I don t remember   this part.  Funny, it s like what s   happening to us, like the past.  The   movie never changes -- it can t change   -- but everytime you see it, it seems   to be different because you re different   -- you notice different things.      RAILLY   If we can t change anything...because   it s already happened, then we ought to   at least smell the flowers.      COLE   Flowers!  What flowers?   From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.      RAILLY    (whispering)   It s an expression.  Here...   She s pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing  it on COLE S head, adjusting it...      COLE   Why are we doing this?      RAILLY   So we can stick our heads out the   window and feel the wind and listen to   the music.  So we can appreciate what   we have while we have it.  Forgive me,   psychiatrists don t cry.   There are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE.      COLE   But maybe I m wrong.  Maybe you re   wrong.  Maybe we re both crazy.      RAILLY   In a few weeks, it will have started or   it won t.  If there are still baseball   games and traffic jams, armed robberies   and boring TV shows -- we ll be so   happy, we ll be glad to turn ourselves   in to the police.      SHADOWY MOVIEGOER   SHHHHHHH          COLE    (whispers)   Where can we hide for a few weeks?   ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground,  the OCEAN behind them.      RAILLY   You said you d never seen the ocean...   EXT.  GORILLA S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT   CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.   URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  Then, METAL ON METAL.  Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen  with phony rocks.  Stalking back and forth.  Huge.  Upset.   CLANK.  CLANK.  METAL ON METAL.  GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.  MASON S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.      DR. MASON S VOICE (o.s.)   What are you doing to me?  Where are   we?  Jeffrey, please...      SANDY S VOICE (o.s.)   For God s sake, put the tape back on   his mouth!   The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.      JEFFREY S VOICE (o.s.)   Forget the tape.  The monkey s louder than   he is.  You gonna tape the monkey s mouth?   EXT.  PANTHERS  PEN/ZOO - NIGHT   Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and  forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.   EXT.  LION S PEN/ZOO   The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  From the darkness,  unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.   EXT.  AVIARIES/ZOO   A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of  metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous  CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other  EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.   INT.  MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM   CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS  continue.  Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie  filling his field of vision.   HIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by  screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock s THE BIRDS.   ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  Empty seats on  both sides of him.  He s alone.  He panics.      COLE   Kathryn?!   INT.  THEATER LOBBY   A lobby poster boasts  Classics 24 Hours A Day  and  Hitchcock  Festival .  PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead  to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a  tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  Turning, she  reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.  She s the BRUNETTE in COLE S DREAM!  Crossing the lobby toward  the auditorium, it s a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate  in the tight dress.   Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a  Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE S DREAM, except this  man s moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  The BLONDE MAN  stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.      BRUNETTE   We re booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.   The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional,  revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  The Blonde Man is  COLE!  He s confused.      COLE   You were in my dream just now.  I   didn t recognize you.      RAILLY   Well, you look pretty different, too.      COLE   I mean in my dream -- I didn t realize   it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I   thought you were gone.      RAILLY    (studies him seriously)   I remember you...like this.  I feel   I ve known you before.  I feel I ve   always known you.   Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him  with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked,  unmarked door, then closing it behind them.   INT.  STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER   RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  She  kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other  janitorial items.  COLE responds to her passion as they move  deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.  Tearing at each other s clothes, they collapse on a rolled  theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.   EXT.  SUBURBS - DAWN   The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the  silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.  The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads  across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he s more a shadowy vision than  reality.  Did we really see him at all?   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN   The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished  building, deserted in the early morning light.  High up, a MONKEY  his head around a girder.   Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.   EXT.  SHOPPING MALL - DAWN   Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other  across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.   Nothing happens.  For a long moment.  Then, an AFRICAN BULL  ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along  the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the  other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.   INT.  TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING   A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is  at the wheel of the cab.      WOMAN CABBlE   What time s your flight, friends?   In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to  his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.      RAILLY   Nine thirty      WOMAN CABBIE   Might be tight.      RAILLY    (startled, checks her watch)   Tight?  My watch says 7:30.      WOMAN CABBIE   On your normal mornin , okay, plenty a   time, but today, gotta take inta account   your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.      RAILLY   What?  What did you say?      WOMAN CABBIE   Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks   didn t turn on your radio this morning.   COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.      WOMAN CABBIE   Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta   the zoo last night.  Then they locked up   this big shot scientist in one of the cages.   Scientist s own kid was one a the ones did it!   RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.      WOMAN CABBlE   Now they got animals all over the   place.  Buncha zebras shut down the   thruway  bout an hour ago and some   kinda thing called an  e-mu  it s got   traffic blocked for miles over on 22.   Flabbergasted, RAILLY S eyes suddenly fill with hope.      RAILLY   That s what they were up to!  Freeing   animals!      COLE   On the walls -- they meant the animals   when they said,  We did it.       WOMAN CABBIE   You can hear it on the radio all the   stations...   As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE  follows her look.   COLE S POV:  two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the  cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!      ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)   In the meantime, numerous animal rights   activists have joined the chorus   condemning what they re calling the    loose canon  activities of Jeffrey   Mason and his Army of the Twelve   Monkeys.     RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)   Can these fools seriously believe that   releasing a captive animal into an   urban environment is being compassionate   to the animal?  It s mindlessly cruel,   almost as indefensible as holding the   animal in captivity in the first place.   RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a  backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.      RAILLY   Maybe it s going to be okay.   INT.  TICKET COUNTER/AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING   CLOSY ON copies of the mug shot of COLE and a photo of RAILLY  while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g..   REVEAL a DETECTIVE, giving the flyers to the uniformed SUPERVISOR  at one end of the ticket counter.      DETECTIVE   Tell your people if they spot either   one of them, not to try and apprehend   then.  They should notify us and...   ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.      P.A. SYSTEM   -- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready   for boarding at Gate Seventeen.   ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the  bustling airport lobby.      COLE   I know this place! ... This is my dream.      RAILLY   Airports all look the same.  Maybe   it s...    (turning, reacting)   James!  Your moustache!  It s slipping.   But COLE isn t listening.  He s looking around, mesmerized.      COLE   It s not just my dream.  I was actually   here!  I remember now.  My parents   brought me to meet my uncle.  About a   week or two before...before...before   everybody started dying.   RAILLY glances around nervously.   RAILLY S POV:  two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the  lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.      RAILLY   They may be looking for us, James.    (placing the tube in his hand)   Use this.  You can fix it in the Men s Room.        COLE    (confounded)   I was here...as a kid.  I think you   were here, too.  But you...looked just   like you look now.      RAILLY    (getting desperate)   James, if we re identified, they re   going to send us someplace...but not to   Key West!      COLE    (snaps out of it, hand to moustache)   Right!  You re right.  I have to fix this.      RAILLY    (indicating a sign)   I ll get the tickets and meet you... in   the Gift Shop.   COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men s Room as  RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip  clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring  glances.   INT.  TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY   BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as  COLE walks past on his way to the Men s Room.   Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it.  Coming  to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.   INT.  TZCKET COUNTER/TERMINAL   CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter,  hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT  who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN.  The GENTLEMAN  walks away.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking  nothing like the Railly on the flyer.      RAILLY   Judy Simmons.  I have reservations for   Key West.   INT.  PAY PHONES/TERMINAL   COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.      COLE   Listen, I don t know whether you re   there or not.  Maybe you just clean   carpets.  If you do, you re lucky --   you re gonna live a long, happy life.   But if you other guys exist and you re   picking this up -- forget about the   Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they   didn t do it.  It was a mistake    Someone else did it.  The Army of The   Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids   playing revolutionaries.  It was   someone else!   COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next  phone looking away quickly.  COLE touches his loose moustache as  he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.      COLE   I ve done my job.  I did what you wanted.   Good luck.  I m not coming back!   COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.  Averting his face, he heads for the Men s Room.   INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY   The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.      TICKET AGENT   Don t see a lot of this... cash.      RAILLY   It s...a long story.      TICKET AGENT    (smiles, hands over the tickets)   They ll begin boarding in about twenty   minutes.  Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.   Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put  them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.  As she kneels  to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from  the waist down.  WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag  resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.  we ve seen this outfit before...in COLE S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL!   INT.  MEN S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY   The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing  and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying  his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.   Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men s  Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some  goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly  against his face as he leans close to the mirror.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Got yourself a prob, Bob?   COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE.  Nothing!  Until  he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an  occupied stall.  It must be him!      COLE   Leave me alone!  I made a report.  I   didn t have to do that.      RASPY VOICE (o.s.)   Point of fact -- you don t belong here.   It s not permitted to let you stay.   A toilet FLUSHES in the  occupied  stall.  COLE S answer is loud  and defiant.      COLE   This is the present.  This is not the past.   This is not the future.  This is right now!   A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the  occupied  stall, gives COLE  a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.      COLE   I m staying here! You got that?  You   can t stop me!      PLUMP MAN    (high pitched voice)   Anything you say, chief.  It s none of   my business.   COLE looks dismayed.  This guy couldn t be  THE VOICE !  And there  are no feet showing under the other stalls.  Did he imagine it?   INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY   The Chicago Bulls bag!  It s on the counter in front of the  TICKET AGENT who s reviewing a stack of tickets in awe...      TICKET AGENT   Woooo-eeee.  San Francisco, New   Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome,   Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking!   That s some trip you re taking, sir,   All in one week!      MR. PONYTAIL (o.s.)   Business.      TICKET AGENT    (handing over the tickets)   Have a good one, sir.   INT.  TERMINAL LOBBY   COLE emerges from the Men s Room, shaken, paranoid.  He glances  around nervously.  Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking  toward the Gift Shop.  Before he gets more than a few steps,  someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.      FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)   You gotta be crazy, man!   COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A.  Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses      COLE   Jo...Jose????      JOSE   Pulling out the tooth, man, that was   nuts!  Here, take this.   JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol.  Astonished, COLE resists!      COLE   What?  What for?  Are you crazy?   Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE S arm.      JOSE   Me?  Are you kiddin?  You re the one!   You were a hero, man.  They gave you a   pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come   back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!      COLE   How did you find me?      JOSE   The phone call, man.  The phone call.      COLE   The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?      JOSE   Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago!   Yes, that phone call.  I been in training   for this a couple a months now -- ever   since I got back from that...  weird    war we were in.  You remember that?    (pressing the pistol on Cole)   Here, take it, man!  You could still be   a hero if you d cooperate!   INT.  GIFT SHOP/TERMINAL - DAY   RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it,  includes it with several magazines she s holding.  She doesn t  notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!   The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and  frowns.  It s getting late and where s Cole?  She turns, heads  for the cash register to make her purchases.   MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.  He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.   The paper features a banner headline... ANIMALS SET FREE  and a  sub head... PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE   over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and  another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.   Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch  again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY  looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.   Startled, RAILLY frowns.  Does she know this man?   MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the  shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.   RAILLY doesn t recognize the man, but we do!  He s DR. MASON S  ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY s lecture!   Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.   Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the  CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops  a bundle of newspapers at her feet.   RAILLY S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened  GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming,  TERRORISTS  CREATE CHAOS .  Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the  gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.   CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab.  There s someone else  in the picture.  It s a man wearing a lab coat and a PONYTAIL!   ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, suddenly remembering!   MEMORY FLASHBACK!  INT.  RECEPTION ROOM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT   RAILLY looks up from the book she s signing and sees DR. PETERS.      DR. PETERS   Isn t it obvious that  Chicken Little    represents the sane vision and that   Homo Sapiens  motto,  Let s go shopping!    is the cry of the true lunatic?   INT.  GIFT SHOP - DAY   RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.      RAILLY   Oh, my God!      P.A  SYSTEM   -- flight 764 for San Francisco is now   ready for boarding at Gate 36.   INT.  LOBBY - DAY   In the confusion of TRAVELERS streaming in different directions,  COLE hurries toward the Gift Shop while JOSE struggles to keep up.      JOSE   Coma on, Cole, don t be an asshole.    (then, blurting it out)   Look, I got orders, man!  You know what   I m sposed to do if you don t go along?   I m sposed to shoot the lady!  You got   that?  They said,  If Cole don t obey   this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his   girlfriend!    COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.      JOSE   I got no choice, man.  These are my   orders.  Just take it, okay?   COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now.  They ve got him.      COLE   This part isn t about the virus, is it?      JOSE   Hey, man...      COLE   It s about obeying, about doing what   you re told.      JOSE   They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya   want?      COLE   Who am I supposed to shoot?   Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.      RAILLY   James!  Thank God!  I thought you d   disappeared.  Listen, I think I know   who it is!  I saw him!  It s Dr. Mason s   assistant.  An apocalypse nut!  The next   flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.   If he s there, it has to be him.   JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY  grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.      COLE   I love you, Kathryn.  Remember that.   She doesn t hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.      RAILLY   Maybe we can stop him.  Maybe we can   actually do something.   INT.  SECURITY CHECK POINT/TERMINAL - DAY   A young boy of nine passes through the magnetic arch grinning.  YOUNG COLE!  Exactly as he appears in the dream!   He joins his PARENTS, who are only visible from their chests  down, and they continue along the concourse.  WE LINGER and  DISCOVER two DETECTIVES watching TRAVELERS as they pass through  the magnetic arch and retrieve their bags from the X-ray machine,  comparing their faces to photos of COLE and RAILLY.   ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.   ANGLE ON THE MONITOR, showing the X-RAY IMAGE of a sports bag moving  along the conveyer belt.  The bag contains some strange objects.   ANGLE ON THE SECURITY OFFICER, reacting.      SECURITY OFFICER   Excuse me, sir.  Would you mind letting me   have a look at the contents of your bag?   ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.      DR. PETERS   Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples.   I have the appropriate papers.   INT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT   RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of  TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security.      RAILLY   Oh, God, we don t have time for this.   ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his  Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of  clothes and a Walkman.      DR. PETERS   Biological samples.  I have the   paperwork right here.   DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY  OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.      SECURITY OFFICER   I m going to have to ask you to open   this, sir.      DR. PETERS   Open it?    (blinks stupidly, then)   Of course.   DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it.   There s a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no  attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE.   SECURITY OFFICER S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a  SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.   ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the  commotion.   ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed  glass tube out of the metal cylinder.      DR. PETERS   Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the   papers -- it s all proper.  I have a   permit.      SECURITY OFFICER   It s empty!   Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.      DR. PETERS   Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!   But I assure you, it s not.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND  SECURITY OFFICER.      RAILLY   Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!      SECOND SECURITY OFFICER   You ll have to get in line, ma am.      TRAVELER   We re all in a hurry, lady.  What s so   special about you?   ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other  metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.      DR. PETERS   You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye.   A beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes,  and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER S nose!      DR. PETERS   It doesn t even have an odor.   The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing,  and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.      SECURITY OFFICER   That s not necessary, sir.  Here you   go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have   a good flight.   Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and  shoves them back into his gym bag.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her  with his finger.      SECOND SECURITY OFFICER   Who are you calling a  moron ?      COLE   Get your hands off her!   The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.   ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get  involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns.   FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE S moustache is slipping.  COLE  senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE S look.  For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away.   ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.      SECURITY OFFICER S VOICE (o.s.}   HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT.   DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.   The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from  the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS.   DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants.   ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he  confronts the SECURITY OFFICER.      COLE   I said, get your hands off her.  She s   not a criminal.  She s a doctor...a   psychiatrist.   RAILLY looks alarmed at that.   ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE  has the photos in his hand.   ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting  hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates.   ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!      RAILLY   THERE HE IS!  HE S CARRYING A DEADLY   VIRUS!  STOP HIM!   ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE  MAN FROM HIS DREAM!   ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.      RAILLY (o.s.)   PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM!   ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE.      FIRST DETECTIVE    (raising his badge)   Police Officers.  Would you step over   here, please.   ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES!   COLE S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a  businessman !  He gives  COLE a cold look.   A beat.  COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off  balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it.   The ALARM goes off!!!!   The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks  him aside like a rag doll.   ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back.   ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.   ANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.      FIRST SECURITY OFFICER   HE S GOT A GUN!   ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE.      FIRST DETECTIVE    STOP OR I LL SHOOT!    ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward  DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a  plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don t see.   IT S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!!  THE  SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH  NEW  MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF  YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS  hurries by.  DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by  pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling...      DR. PETERS   WATCH IT!   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching...   YOUNG COLE S POV:  a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his  moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear  shot in the crowded passageway.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings,  high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS...      BRUNETTE (RAILLY)   N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!   YOUNG COLE S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  CRACK!   YOUNG COLE S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling.   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him.      MOTHER S VOICE (o.s.)   My God!  They shot that man!   Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE  MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up  and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE S cheek, touching her tears.  (WE VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT,  UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.)   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see  emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the  BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN.      FATHER S VOICE (o.s.)   Come along, son, this is no place for us.   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER S ARM drapes over his shoulder,  steering him.  YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he s led away.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging  helplessly.  It s too late.  The BLONDE MAN is dead.   YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears,  suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for  something.  POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her.  Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse.   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS  (whose faces remain out of view).  He can t help sneaking another  look back.   YOUNG COLE S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting  RAILLY.  Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically.   Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she s  found what she s looking for!   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look.   ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded  concourse.   ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look.      FATHER S VOICE (o.s.)   Hurry up, son.   With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG  COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  WE MOVE IN...CLOSE...  CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS,  BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL.  WE DON T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING,  BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER!      MOTHER S VOICE (o.s.)   Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy.   INT.  747 CABIN - DAY   DR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack  containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  Next to  him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says...      FELLOW TRAVELER S VOICE (o.s.)   It s obscene, all the violence, all the   lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now.   You might say...we re the next endangered   species...human beings!   CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor.      DR. PETERS   I think you re right. sir.  I think   you ve hit the nail on the head.   DR. PETERS  POV:  the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman  in a business suit, offering his hand congenially.  DR. PETERS  doesn t know who this man is, but we do.  It s the ASTROPHYSICIST!      ASTROPHYSICIST   Jones is my name.  I m in insurance.   EXT.   PARKING LOT/AIRPORT   As YOUNG COLE S PARENTS (seen only as sleeves and torsos) usher  YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks  back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.

JULY 4, 2020.                  As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT S VOICE.                                       PHIL                          T minus ten, nine, eight, start                           ignition sequence, five, four, three,                           two, one, ignition... Liftoff!                 A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint,                 ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN S LAUGHTER,                 excited SHOUTS.                 EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON                 DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20 s, kneeling, with a                 gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has                 got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using                 an empty longneck as his launching tube.                                       CHILDREN                               (all at once)                          My turn! My turn! No, I was next!                           No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can                           I do one? I want to do one!                                       PHIL                          Guys, guys, please! This is risky                           stuff here. And I m a highly trained                           professional.                 Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins.                 There s little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting                 poster: he s messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for                 silence.                                       PHIL                          Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch                           another booster...                 Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman,                 is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and                 Phil catches it.                                       PHIL                          ...just as soon as he completes his                           fuel intake.                 ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE                 Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin                 to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in                 the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb.                 DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their                 families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out                 blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of                 balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored,                 from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed                 about. A banner, strung between trees, reads  BON VOYAGE,                 MARS ONE!!!                                        WILLIS                          It ll take us six months just to get                           to Mars. Another year on the surface,                           then six months back. That s two                           years...                 Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut,                 NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He s got his other arm                 around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME,                 ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut,                 early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all                 too well.                                       WILLIS                          I guess what I m trying to say is,                           since this is my last night on Earth,                           it s gonna be a very precious memory                           to me. Y know?                                       PRETTY GIRL                          Nice try, Nick.                 As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and                 walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his                 beer, swigs it.                 ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-                pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has                 paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI                 KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as                 they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily                 at the chef.                                       KIROV                          Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won t                           be heading back to Earth till ten                           days after you guys land at our base                           camp with Mars Two. That s a pretty                           good long rendezvous.                 WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat                 over a Hawaiian shirt and a  KISS THE CHEF  apron. An entire                 pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting                 this as he smiles at Malik.                                       WOODY                          What are you suggesting, Sergei?                                       KIROV                          Maybe you should bring a baseball                           bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two                           crews could have ourselves a little                           Solar System Series.                                       WOODY                          Please. Half you guys are foreigners.                           We d crush you.                                       KIROV                          No, no, we have equal crews. Three                           men, one woman. Same handicap.                 He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.                                       WOODY                          Easy now, you re talking about my                           wife.                               (seeing her approach)                          And Terri just happens to be one                           helluva shortstop.                 DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of                 corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive                 by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss                 Woody s cheek; there s a wonderful, sexy spark between them.                 Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.                                       TERRI                          Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls                           his own strikes. Thousand bucks make                           it interesting?                 He s a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who                 smiles, nods her cool agreement.                                       COTE                          Eh bien. Winner take all.                                       TERRI                          Good.                               (smiles sweetly at                                Kirov)                          Bring some balls.                 The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as                 Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt                 grin.                                       WOODY                          You wanna know the sad part?                           Technically I outrank her. But if we                           want any peace at all on Mars Two,                           I m gonna be saying a lot of  Yes,                           dears.                  The others laugh.                 ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run                 by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a                 picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS  WIVES are opening containers                 of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.                                       1ST WIFE                          ...just not sure how I feel about                           NASA allowing couples to go on this                           type of mission together.                 One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st                 Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.                                       1ST WIFE                               (embarrassed)                          Nothing personal, Terri. It s just                           that, well, it s kind of a funny                           feeling for those of us staying                           behind.                                       TERRI                               (carefully neutral)                          All the research shows that marriage                           will provide stability on these long                           duration trips.                                       2ND WIFE                          Then they haven t studied some of                           the couples I ve known.                 Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn t really                 have much in common with these women -- before moving on.                 ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight                 tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.                                       3RD WIFE                          Anybody seen Jim McConnell?                                       4TH WIFE                          I don t think he s coming.                                       1ST WIFE                          God, that poor man. How s he doing?                                       2ND WIFE                          Totally losing it, from what I hear.                           Can t sleep, can t eat. Visits her                           grave almost every day.                               (lowers her voice)                          They say he could lose mission status.                                       3RD WIFE                          Oh, that s so sad. That is just so                           tragic. You go to a routine physical                           one day, and wham.                                       4TH WIFE                          After all those years of training,                           too. It was their whole dream.                                       1ST WIFE                          Must be a pretty funny feeling for                           Luke Graham. Y know? Now he s gonna                           be in the history books. First man                           on Mars...                 She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in                 agreement, following her glance...                 In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage,                 his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs                 which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another                 figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.                 CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early                 30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE                 GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the                 restless intellect of a scientist. He s unaware of her                 approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her                 with an apologetic smile.                                       DEBRA                          He s not coming, Luke.                                       LUKE                          Jim deserves this, too. All his                           friends are here. And it s my last                           night.                                       DEBRA                               (gently)                          Your last night with us, too.                 He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his                 arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.                                       LUKE                          I love you, Deb.                                       DEBRA                          I love you too, baby. But maybe you                           should spend some time with Bobby.                                       LUKE                          Yeah. I will. Where is he?                                       DEBRA                          Up in his fort.                 He kisses her again, then goes. Debra s eyes follow him,                 with a mixture of pride and sadness.                 ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into                 EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON                 Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still                 shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.                 In the back corner of the yard, where it s quieter, he passes                 Willis, who s sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to                 PRETTY GIRL #2.                                       WILLIS                          Deep space is so lonesome. So cold.                           But I guess I ll have my memories to                           keep me warm...                 Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he                 reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.                 A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around                 his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby                 on a tripod. He looks lonely.                 Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him.                 BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at                 the sky.                                       BOBBY                          Who s gonna read to me now, at                           bedtime?                 Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.                                       LUKE                          Mommy will.                                       BOBBY                          I like when you do it. Now we re                           never gonna finish our book.                 His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He s fighting back tears.                 Luke is moved. Another brief silence.                                       LUKE                          Well, I ll tell you what. I ve been                           thinking about that. And what I                           thought was -- how  bout if I bring                           along my own copy?                               (Bobby looks at him)                          Then every night, wherever I am,                           I ll read a little bit more of it.                           And I ll know that you and Mommy,                           wherever you are, you re reading it                           too. That way, it ll feel like we re                           still reading it together.  Cause I                           don t know about you, but I m pretty                           anxious to find out how  ol Ben Gunn                           got marooned on that island. What                           d you say?                 Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better.                 Luke is proud of his son s courage.                                       LUKE                          Good deal. Can I have a hug?                 Bobby s arms go around his father s neck. He hugs Luke                 fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin                 young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence.                 Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR.                 They both turn.                 An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.                 Luke s expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.                 EXT. LUKE S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON                 The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver                 climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes                 out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon.                 The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a                 moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards                 the party, then pauses again.                 Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She                 smiles tentatively.                 JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has                 dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.                 Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet                 competence in this man, an unforced authority; he s a natural                 leader.                 Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They                 separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.                                       DEBRA                          We were afraid you wouldn t come.                                       MCCONNELL                          I caught a whiff of your barbecue.                           After that I was helpless.                                       DEBRA                          All the way out in Galveston?                                       MCCONNELL                          Something like that.                               (she smiles)                          It s his night, Deb. I didn t want                           to spoil it.                                       DEBRA                          Spoil it? He s been going crazy                           looking for you.                 Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around                 Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them                 so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.                                       LUKE                          C mon. A whole lot of folks here are                           gonna be mighty glad to see you.                 McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and                 together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards                 the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)                 All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two:                 McConnell s Jeep and Woody s classic  Vette. Willis, one of                 the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched                 behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They                 zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.                 EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT                 The yard is nearly deserted. The  Bon Voyage  banner has                 torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a                 napkin blows across the ground.                 In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the                 waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.                 CLOSER ON THIS TRIO                 As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a                 moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the                 sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots                 mingling with the silver ones.

The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even                 Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.                                       LUKE                          Then you ve got a short memory.

If they sent us off to                           Mars together, there wouldn t be                           enough fuel to lift all those egos.

But                           putting the first footprints on Mars?                           Nah. That s for guys who...

He grabs playfully at Woody s neck. Woody smacks his hand                 away, laughing.                                       WOODY                          You read the same damn science fiction                           books that I did! You re just not                           man enough to wear jewelry!                 He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship                 emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at                 McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.                                       WOODY                          You want Flash. You know you want                           him. Well you ll have to come through                           me!                 Luke grabs Woody s arm to give McConnell a better shot at                 the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing.                 McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.                                       MCCONNELL                          God, she would ve loved to see you                           two clowns. Just one more time.                 He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once                 his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions.                 Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell                 shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them,                 walking away a few steps.                 Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.                 EXT. LUKE S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT                 McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette.                 McConnell has regained his composure.                                       LUKE                          Hey, Woodrow, isn t it about time                           you donated this thing to a museum?                 Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily.

With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into                 gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence.                 Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We                 sense he s been waiting all night for a chance to say this.                                       LUKE                          Should ve been your mission, Jim.                           Yours and Maggie s.                 McConnell, looking after Woody s car, becomes very still.                                       LUKE                          None of us ever wanted Mars the way                           you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve                           years of hoping for this assignment,                           training for it --                                       MCCONNELL                          That s all over now.                                       LUKE                          If Maggie hadn t gotten sick -- if                           you hadn t pulled yourself out of                           the rotation to take care of her --                 McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will                 not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on.                                       LUKE                          No, I m gonna say this. I have to                           say it...                               (pause)                          I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled                           you for it every step of the way.                           Never wanted to beat anybody so bad                           in my life. But not like this...                           Jim, I d give this all up in a second,                           if it would bring Maggie back to us.                 McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn t trust                 his own voice.                                       MCCONNELL                          I know that, Luke. You don t have to                           say it... Mars is yours now. Go get                           it.

Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luke                 walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a                 moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his                 door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --                 EXT. NIGHT SKY                 A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars                 itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant                 than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.                 CLOSE ON MCCONNELL S FACE                 As we see these thoughts going through him. After a moment                 he looks down at                 HIS SHOES                 And the sandy verge of the front yard.                 MCCONNELL S EYES                 Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite                 yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE                 And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint                 in the sandy soil...

DAY                 Instantly we re hurled into an immense, stunning LANDSCAPE,                 mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A                 vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders                 the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin                 moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky. On the horizon, towering,                 craggy peaks. And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a                 small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.

Lettering on its side reads  ARES-8.                  SUPER TITLE:  MARS. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. EIGHT MONTHS LATER.                  Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning                 focus, as it becomes intrigued by something OFFSCREEN -- a                 higher, more distant target. The little fellow almost quivers                 with excitement.                 EXT. MARS. TIU VALLIS. DAY                 A one-man ATV ROVER waits in the background, in a dry                 streambed, as Luke, in an EVA spacesuit, swings a clawed                 rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face.                 Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk,                 he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth s).                 A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely,                 holding it up to his clear faceplate. He s very happy,                 absorbed in this work, when his RADIO CRACKLES.                                       COTE                          Luke, you read me?                                       LUKE                          Yeah, Renee.                                       COTE                          Luke, I just got ARES-8 on line and...                           Well, we think you re gonna wanna                           see this for yourself.                 Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.                                       LUKE                          Copy that.                 As Luke turns away, headed for the rover                 WE PULL WIDE                 To REVEAL a STAGGERING PROSPECT, seen for the first time:                 Valles Marineris, that planet-creasing slash. So wide, so                 deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from New                 York to L.A.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY                 The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined                 Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They re in NASA                 jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced                 gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A                 VIDEO SCREEN                 We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-                covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge.                 What s most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely                 protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along                 the mountain s ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast                 to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what s                 more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth,                 multi-planed symmetry.                                       LUKE                          What the hell is that?                                       COTE                          No idea, boss.                                       LUKE                          Where is it?                 Cote glances at the others. They re all smirking, as if they                 share some secret joke Luke s not yet in on.                                       WILLIS                          You don t wanna know.                                       LUKE                          C mon, what s so funny? Gimme the                           coordinates.                 He leans over to read a digital gauge, but Cote covers it                 with her hand, enjoying the tease.

So?                               (pause)                          Oh no. You re not telling me --                 They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke s expression is                 incredulous, exasperated.                                       COTE                          Oui. Exactement! It s Kirov s fault,                           he picked today s sector.                                       KIROV                          Hey, c mon! We ve got a scientific                           duty to check that thing out.                 Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote.                 They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without                 success to coax more resolution.                                       LUKE                          Great. That s great. The first anomaly                           we hit, and it s gotta be in the one                           place guaranteed to make NASA look                           ridiculous... You know how many books                           have been written about that damned                           mountain?                                       COTE                          The Egyptians put it there.                                       KIROV                          No, the Amazons.

LUKE                          And all because a couple of lousy                           impact craters happen to look like                           eye sockets. If this gets out, we ll                           have every UFO kook on Earth spouting                           off on the six o clock news...

LUKE                          It s an upwelling, for sure. But                           maybe not volcanic...                 The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with                 growing excitement. He points to the screen.                                       LUKE                          Look at the color.

Not unless...                 They look at each other, Luke s excitement now leaping from                 one to another of them. They re almost trembling.                                       WILLIS                          Oh my God.                                       LUKE                          How far away is it?

LUKE                               (considers a moment)                          Let s send a packet to Micker. Then                           we ll go check it out.                 EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY                 AIRLOCK DOORS                 Slide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear.                 They walk over to...                 THE FOUR-MAN ROVER                 The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in                 pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote                 and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke                 puts the rover in drive.                 WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY                 As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking                 up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the                 Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna                 can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate,                 inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There s also an OXYGEN STILL,                 PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred                 meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which                 arrived as a separate, unmanned flight.                 Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN                 FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene.

DAY                 A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting                 majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA                 and U.N. flag decals.                 SUPER TITLE:  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION                 CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG.                  We MOVE IN towards another of the station s segments, which                 is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and                 insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and                 Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where                 Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We                 hear LUKE S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers.                                       LUKE                          This is a truly anomalous formation.                           Looks like nothing we ve seen so                           far. The structure appears to be                           crystalline, at least from the angle                           displayed by ARES-8 ...                 INT. MMCR. DAY                 On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars                 One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab,                 finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE.                                       LUKE                               (grins)                          We re all trying not to go too nuts                           up here, but -- we think there s a                           good chance this could be an extrusion                           from some subsurface, geothermal                           column of water. And if we re right...                 He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries.                                       LUKE                          ...then we ve found the key to                           permanent human colonization.                 IN THE MMCR                 There s an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS,                 FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic,                 epochal discovery.                 MCCONNELL                 Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He s now the                 Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is                 brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for                 instructions.                                       MCCONNELL                          Tell geology and hydrology we need                           to scramble on this. Full-court press.                 The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the                 intense excitement of those around him, stares up at                 THE SCREEN                 Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the                 excitement their bombshell will create.                                       LUKE                          Anyway, we are going out to take a                           closer look at it, try to get an                           idea of its composition.

DAY                 The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast TOWARDS                 CAMERA. We BOOM DOWN to REVEAL Ares-8, still faithfully                 holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout                 WHIRRING OUT.                 The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch                 door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all                 the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in                 awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS.                                       KIROV                          Jesus Christ...                 THE MYSTERIOUS PEAK                 Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and                 smooth as if an architect had drawn them. It pierces through                 the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an                 isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left                 to right in front of them.                 THE ASTRONAUTS                 Walk towards the mountain. There s a very deep, very low,                 staccato tone intruding over their headsets.

As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling                 tone continues.                 INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR.

I                           understand a comm packet is incoming                           from Mars One Base Camp, so you may                           find this interesting.                 He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside.                 INT. MMCR. DAY                 The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive                 array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big                 screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The                 NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.                                       AMBASSADOR                          That man over there. He s in charge?                 BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO                 MCCONNELL                 Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is                 giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart,                 like so many eager bees.                 BECK                 Smiles indulgently at the ambassador s misunderstanding.                                       BECK                          No, actually, that s Jim McConnell,                           the CAPCOM. Our voice link to the                           astronauts? Jim s been with the manned                           Mars program since its inception.                           One of our real pioneers.                                       AMBASSADOR                          Will he be going to Mars, too?                                       BECK                          Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.                 ON THE SCREEN                 Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing                 away their dishes and leftovers.                                       LUKE                          ...anyway, that s about it. We ll                           send another packet when we get back.                 Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can                 barely conceal their grins.                                       LUKE                          Oh, right. One more thing. Today is                           a very special day for a good friend                           of ours, and I know he s there right                           now.                 McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What s Luke up to?                                       LUKE                          Now, he hates it when any fuss is                           made, so I won t mention his name...                 A look of relief comes over McConnell.                                       LUKE                          ...because the last thing in the                           world I d ever want to do is embarrass                           someone like Jim McConnell.                 McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov                 appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning                 candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING                  Happy Birthday  to him. Loudly. And very off-key.                                       LUKE                          C mon, you Micker weasels, sing!                 Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of                 the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of                 Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified.                                       LUKE                               (sings a line, then,                                to CAMERA:)                          Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he                           all red with one of those fake  I m-                          a-good-sport  grins?                 Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face                 with a fake  I m-a-good-sport  grin.                                       LUKE                          And hey, you guys, check out Ray!                           Does he have on one of his  This-                          wasn t-in-my-mission-plan  faces?                 Indeed, Beck s smile is thin, sour, disapproving.                                       LUKE                          Nothing you can do about it, Ray!                           We re a hundred million miles away!                 Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the                 cupcake in a toast.                                       LUKE                          Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!                 He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and                 applaud, then wave goodbye.                                       LUKE                          Catch you again soon. Take care,                           buddy. End of transmission.                 Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen                 GOES BLACK.                 Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell s. He s annoyed,                 as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell s                 fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY                 Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov                 has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain.                 Luke turns to Cote.                                       LUKE                          Well? What s under there?                                       COTE                               (puzzled)                          Je ne sais pas. I... I think there s                           something wrong with the equipment.                                       LUKE                          What?                                       COTE                          I mean, it can t be right. It says...                           it says there s metal under there.                 Luke doesn t understand. He walks up to look at the display                 screen.                                       COTE                               (points)                          There s ten, twelve meters of rubble                           and sand, and then... solid metal.                                       LUKE                          That doesn t make any sense. You re                           reading a vein of ore.                                       COTE                               (shakes her head)                          No. It s under the whole mountain.                 The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.                                       LUKE                          Nick, could the problem with the                           antenna be interfering?                                       WILLIS                          Could be.                                       LUKE                               (to Cote and Kirov)                          Try it closer and up the power. I ll                           watch the screen.                 INT. MMCR. DAY                 McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as                 the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N.                 ambassadors.                                       MCCONNELL                          Ah, we re all pretty stoked about                           that formation you spotted, Mars                           One. The folks in the geology and                           hydrology back rooms are going over                           your images and comparing them to                           every photomap they ve got.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY                 Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain,                 resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating                 tone continues.                 Luke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis,                 who s still working on the rover s antenna.                                       LUKE                          Nick, how we coming on that antenna?                                       WILLIS                          Goin  as fast as I can, boss.                 Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on                 the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis.                                       KIROV                          Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I                           am. I can t get this to work.                 Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts                 towards the radar gun.                 INT. MMCR. DAY                 McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it.                                       MCCONNELL                          Medical wants me to remind you that                           you re three days late on your blood                           tests. I know they re a bore, but                           you ve got to get them done, or                           else... or else I don t know what.                           Just do them, okay?                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY                 Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running.                                       KIROV                          All set here, chief.                 Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover.                                       LUKE                          Okay. Crank up the juice and let s                           see what s in this sucker.                 INT. MMCR. DAY                 McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates.                                       MCCONNELL                          I think that s about it for business.                           But on a personal note, be advised                           that, ah, none of you can sing worth                           a damn.                 LAUGHTER in the MMCR.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY                 Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound...                 KIROV                 Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle                 slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and                 feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the                 pulsing tone we ve been hearing suddenly stops.                 LUKE                 Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.                                       LUKE                          Why did that stop?                 A split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH,                 a mighty rushing of wind, as                 A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER                 Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the                 mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up                 debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface                 of the slopes.                 THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS                 Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of                 energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they re too                 fascinated to even be scared.                 TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV                 We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher,                 perfectly straight, until in just moments it s as tall as a                 skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing                 at its top into a conical vortex. It s sucking up so much                 dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the                 accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent                 outer  skin .                 THE ASTRONAUTS                 Exchange amazed glances. Can t believe their eyes...                 INT. MMCR. DAY                 McConnell still hovers by the microphone.                                       MCCONNELL                          Honestly, Luke, if you guys don t                           have anything better to do with your                           time, I can make some suggestions to                           mission medical. There are worse                           things than blood tests.                 LAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY                 Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand                 and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns.                 SAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE                 As the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is                 becoming more general across the area. More violent.                 LUKE IS ALARMED                 And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips                 moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He                 waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards                 the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him,                 retreating.                 Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off                 the cylinder.                 Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn t moved. In fact                 he s busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries                 over to him, tugs his sleeve.                 WILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA                 But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face                 with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut s frightened                 gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees                 THE TOP OF THE VORTEX                 Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they re                 looking into the huge open  mouth  of it, as sand and rocks                 fly into the swirling darkness...                 The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the                 mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And                 then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little                 group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY                 Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards                 the rover. But the suction is so great, it s as if they re                 held back by wires.                 The ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin                 to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex,                 the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight                 train...                 AHEAD OF THEM                 In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out                 Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their                 strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast.                 Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes                 into Cote s helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her                 instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately                 crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...                 LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP                 As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An                 instant later he sees                 KIROV                 Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying                 blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream                 as he vanishes...                 THE GROUND AT LUKE S FEET                 Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling                 frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily                 arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with                 his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is                 almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound                 over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him                 alive...                 CLOSE ON LUKE                 Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final                 instant, as...                 HIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS                 Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning                 and tumbling like a rag doll...                 CLOSE ON WILLIS S FACE                 His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at                 him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood,                 and...                 DISTANT ANGLE - LUKE S POV                 Willis s spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating                 into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the                 hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as                 abruptly...                 STOPS. Vanishes.                 There is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own                 way as the roaring storm itself had been...                 WIDE ANGLE                 On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction,                 pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away,                 settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again                 calm, peaceful.                 And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear                 another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.                 INT. MMCR.

WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater,                 with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously                 still with all four wheels...                 WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially                 crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE,                 its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we                 come to the area where the fissure had been, and see                 THE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN                 Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke.                 The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see                 EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY                 An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking                 back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow                 crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and                 rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face.                 The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The                 features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes,                 slopes, ramps. The  eyes  -- hatches of some kind? -- are                 closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but                 terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask.                 We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick,                 scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble                 continues, low and insistent...

Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the                 cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual.

Piece of cake.                 He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle                 of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up                 beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot s                 seat.

OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY                 A crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded                 than we ve ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying                 by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering                 feverishly into microphones.                 On the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow                 of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site                 of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red.                 WOODY AND HIS CREW                 Are staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck                 stand nearby, briefing them.

WOODY                          What about the REMO? It went into                           Mars orbit last week. Maybe that                           could give us some clue.                                       MCCONNELL                          Good thinking, Woody. That s just                           what we tried next.                 He leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard.                 ON THE CENTER SCREEN                 An orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around Mars,                 leaving a glowing electronic trail. This dot gets isolated                 in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer-                animated image of a small, ugly, industrial-looking unmanned                 cargo craft, labelled  REMO.

But                           there was something else. The REMO S                           computer contained an uplink message --                           a very faint, highly distorted                           transmission from Mars One Base Camp.

MCCONNELL                          Even if Luke was in great shape, he                           couldn t get home.

WOODY                          Other than the computers, how do we                           think the ERV fared?                                       BECK                          Well, so far our modelling says it                           should be in pretty good shape.                                       WOODY                          Which means it s gonna be up to us                           to get new motherboards, drives, and                           software to Mars. As fast as we can.                 McConnell looks at him, nods. They re on the same wavelength.                 But Beck is more cautious.                                       BECK                          Whoa, slow down. It s gonna take us                           weeks just to analyze this data.                                       MCCONNELL                          Right, but meanwhile, we ve gotta be                           working up a mission plan.

And even                           if he s not, it s doubtful he s going                           to be able to transmit again. So we                           wouldn t know whether it s safe to                           land until you were almost there.                                       PHIL                          What about SIMA?                 Terri looks at Phil -- SIMA?                                       PHIL                          The Saturn Imaging Probe.

It could                           be retasked to take pictures, read                           radiation levels at Mars One Base                           Camp.                                       WOODY                          Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us                           Luke hasn t survived and it s not                           safe to land, we swing around Mars                           and come right back home.                                       MCCONNELL                          Yes. We can design the mission to                           have a free return capability. It s                           a long trip, but if you don t land                           it s the best option.                                       BECK                          We re getting ahead of ourselves.                           You re forgetting the bigger problem.

Our first                           decent launch window is almost eight                           months from now.                                       MCCONNELL                          But we can go earlier and get there                           faster if we reconfigure the payload                           for extra fuel. We ve modelled that,                           Ray. I ve modelled it.                                       BECK                          On paper, yeah. But those stresses                           have never been tested in space.                                       MCCONNELL                          The ship can take it.                                       BECK                          I wasn t thinking of just the ship.                 A tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these                 two tough-minded men, once good friends.                                       MCCONNELL                          I know the protocols for a Mars                           Recovery Mission better than anybody,                           because I helped design them. And                           I m saying these guys can do it.                                       WOODY                          He s right, Ray. We ve got a real                           shot.                 A pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody.                                       BECK                          Give me an updated mission plan by                           0800 tomorrow. Then I ll put it in                           the works.                                       MCCONNELL                          You ll have it by 0600.                 He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager.                                       MCCONNELL                          Let s get to work.                 McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts                 out, too, Woody stops him.                                       WOODY                          Chief, could I have a word?                 Beck looks at him a moment, nods.

This                           is a different mission, with a                           different objective.

He only had                           to pass a few more psych evaluations,                           but he refused to take them.                                       WOODY                          Ray, he s the best pilot I ever saw,                           and you ve got him benched at a desk.                                       BECK                          Everybody has to pass the psych                           prelims. No exceptions. Jim knew                           that.                                       WOODY                          Maggie was his wife.

It was tough as hell, but                           I d do it again.                                       WOODY                          His wife wasted away in front of his                           eyes. What was he supposed to do?                           Suck it up? Get with the program?                           What was his crime? That he was upset?                           That he cried...?

You want me to bet four more                           lives on that?                 This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on                 harder, with even greater intensity.                                       WOODY                          When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked                           the shit out of him. It knocked the                           hell out of all of us. But you know                           and I know that he s still the best                           we ve got. He and Maggie wrote the                           book on Mars. He s got more hours in                           the sims than the rest of us put                           together. Ray, we can do this. Give                           me McConnell as co-pilot, and we                           will bring Luke home. And that s a                           promise.                 Beck looks back at him, his features taunt.                 INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY                 Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control                 room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as                 IN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV                 Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM s                 console.

Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening                 intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly.                 After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search                 the room till they find                 WOODY S FACE                 Woody looks back at him, nods: C mon, man. Take it.                 MCCONNELL S OWN FACE                 Is a study in conflicting emotions. But after a moment he                 masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck. A few more                 quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand.                 McConnell hesitates, then shakes it. Both men rise, and                 McConnell turns again to look towards                 WOODY, TERRI, AND PHIL                 Who react with relief, glad that he s now a part of their                 crew. Woody grins, giving him a thumb s up.                 CLOSE ON MCCONNELL S FACE                 As he smiles. Then he starts towards them, with a new energy                 in his step, a new sense of confidence and purpose. And as                 he WALKS TOWARDS US, PASSING OUT OF FRAME...

DAY                 An infinite canopy of stars. After a moment, some of them                 begin to be BLOTTED OUT as                 A SPACESHIP                 Glides INTO VIEW.  MARS RECOVERY  (formerly Mars Two) looks                 much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted                 above a  tuna can  crew Hab module.                 SUPER TITLE:  MARS RECOVERY. MISSION DAY 172.                  The entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull                 that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we                 see window ports spinning past, then an American flag emblem.                 Behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts,                 like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round                 PROPELLANT TANKS. Then vast, delicate-looking rectangular                 SOLAR PANELS, which sweep out to either side of the ship;                 these also bear the dish of the earth-pointing HI-GAIN                 ANTENNA. And finally comes the great mass of the ENGINE BELLS,                 housed within a curving AEROSHELL; three hatches in the                 aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through                 for a mid-course burn.                 CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER                 To the forward section of the ship, APPROACHING a viewport                 in the EVA airlock chamber. Inside, we can see Phil leaning                 forward, concentrating on some task...                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY. A BUNCH OF M&MS                 Are floating in mid-air, forming an intricate 3D pattern. In                 the EVA airlock, it s zero G.                 Phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just                 completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue                 M&M. He looks bored, sluggish. In the b.g., Terri is hunched                 over a microscope.                 McConnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming                 up from the lower Hab, then pushes off from the ladder,                 floating towards Phil. He grins, admiring Phil s obsessive                 handiwork.                                       MCCONNELL                          What s that?                                       PHIL                          That... is the exact chemical                           composition of my ideal woman.                                       MCCONNELL                          Used to be.                 He plucks out a couple of the M&Ms as he drifts by.                                       PHIL                          Hey!                 McConnell grins, snacking on the M&Ms.                                       MCCONNELL                          Now what is it?                 Phil looks sadly at his floating model.                                       PHIL                          A frog.                 McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the                 rest of the M&Ms. Swooping at them with both hands.                                       TERRI                          I guess now we have our answer to                           the effects of long-term                           interplanetary travel on the human                           mind. The answer is Phil.                                       MCCONNELL                               (smiles)                          I m gonna get an update on SIMA. It                           should be just about close enough to                           start capturing some surface images.                 He s drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts                 up to the cockpit, atop the Hab.                 INT. COCKPIT. DAY                 As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the                 forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor. The                 cockpit is also zero G.                                       MCCONNELL                          Hey, Skip.                                       WOODY                          Take a look.                 McConnell pulls himself forward.                 ANGLE ON MONITOR                 MARS completely fills the screen. Surface details are clearly                 visible. Something is moving down there, an amorphous brown                 swirl.                 INT. COCKPIT. DAY                                       WOODY                          What do you make of that?                                       MCCONNELL                          Dust storm. Southern hemisphere,                           coming from the east... Big fella,                           too.                                       WOODY                          Headed for Chryse Planitia.                                       MCCONNELL                          Yup. Could get a little hairy just                           about landing time...                 McConnell pulls back from the screen, looks at Woody.                                       WOODY                          We ll have to be ready to move fast.                           Maybe even advance our ETA. Those                           things can cover the whole planet,                           and last up to a year.                 A beat. They both hope he s wrong.                                       MCCONNELL                          When does SIMA do her fly-by?                                       WOODY                          Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That s                           when we find out whether we came all                           this way for nothing.                 They exchange a glance. Woody s right, but the thought is                 too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.                                       MCCONNELL                               (softly)                          My money s on Luke.                 INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING                 CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK                 Just turning over to read  0545.                  TERRI                 Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her                 redrimmed eyes, it s been a long, anxious night. Restlessly,                 looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of                 blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby                 is her electron microscope.                 MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB)                 Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed.                 The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can                 move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau.                 PHOTO OF A WOMAN                 Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling,                 dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with                 intelligence and energy.                 MCCONNELL                 Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads  0546.                  PHIL (LOWER HAB)                 Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a                 towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances                 at another digital clock, which reads  0547.  Shakes his                 head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is                 surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the                 loudspeakers: Elvis Presley s  Blue Moon.                  OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY                 Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops                 himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of                 WOODY AND TERRI DANCING                 Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly                 good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious.                 He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing                 off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some                 passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head.                                       PHIL                          What brought this on?                                       WOODY                          Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful.                           Once we re in Mars gravity, it s                           back to shuffling my feet and grabbing                           her butt.                                       TERRI                          I ll take what I can get.                 She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees                 MCCONNELL                 Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A                 twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes                 meet Phil s, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile:                 Aren t they something?                 Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP S COMPUTER,                 then an announcement.                                       COMPUTER                          Attention. Incoming packet.                 They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to                 a console, shuts off the music.                                       MCCONNELL                          It s SIMA.                 INT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER                 The crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are                 dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we                 can tell the news is not good.                 CLOSE ON THE SCREEN                 It s a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars                 One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life.                                       WOODY                          Looks deserted.                                       PHIL                          It s still standing, though. So is                           the ERV. And look, there s the                           greenhouse.                                       MCCONNELL                          We know Luke survived for at least a                           few hours. Question is, are there                           any signs of recent activity?                 They all scan the screen. Phil spots something.                                       PHIL                          There.                 He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look.                 CLOSE ON THE SCREEN                 Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point,                 the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some                 fifty meters from the hab.                                       PHIL                          What the hell are those?                 McConnell gets it first.                                       MCCONNELL                          Graves.                 They all realize he s right. They sit back, stunned. But                 then Phil has another thought.                                       PHIL                          Hold on. There s only three. That                           means --                                       TERRI                          Phil --                                       PHIL                          It means Luke must still be --                                       TERRI                          No. It just means there was nobody                           left to bury him.                 This quiets everyone for a long moment.                                       WOODY                          Check the radiation levels.                 Phil keys in some commands and data pops up onscreen.                                       PHIL                          Normal.                                       WOODY                          Go to the disaster site.                 Phil uses the stylus to bring MORE IMAGES into view. The                 frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the Face,                 first in SWIFT BLURS, then slowing. Scattered rock debris                 come into view. The IMAGE ARRIVES where the mountain was,                 and they see...                 Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, dropped                 uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. As                 if - but this makes no sense -- it had been swirled towards                 a LARGE CRATER. The crater itself is a perfect circle. They                 FOCUS on the CENTER OF THE CRATER, but the image gets                 distorted by STATIC.                                       MCCONNELL                          What s wrong?                                       PHIL                          I don t know. Magnetic interference?                 Phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won t clear up.                                       WOODY                          Go to infrared.                 Phil works the keyboard.                 THE SCREEN                 Goes to INFRARED, reading heat, The middle of the IMAGE,                 where the Face is, is still distorted, refusing focus.                 THE ASTRONAUTS                 Sit back, exasperated.                                       PHIL                          Must be a problem with SIMA. I don t                           see how an earthquake, six months                           ago, could give us this kind of                           distortion.                                       MCCONNELL                          That was no quake.                 He leans closer, staring intently.                                       WOODY                          Then what the hell was it?                 McConnell shakes his head. But his every sense is engaged;                 he s like a predator just sighting his prey for the first                 time. We see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock                 this secret.                 EXT. SPACE. DAY                 Mars Recovery is speeding ever closer to Mars, which now                 looms large, a dusty red mysterious sphere.                 INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. DAY                 McConnell and crew are eating dinner while they watch a taped                 message from MMCR.                 CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN                 As Ray Beck addresses them. Other NASA STAFFERS, twenty or                 more, have crowded in behind him, and we sense their great                 hopefulness and high spirits; the whole team s triumph is                 tantalizingly close now.                                       BECK                          We re going to continue analyzing                           this data and try to determine what                           the problem is with those images.                           Frankly, we re just as stumped as                           you guys, but we ll keep on it.                               (glancing around)                          We agree that the evidence of the                           graves is inconclusive and that a                           ground search is advisable. Be aware                           there are little sand storms kicking                           up near Mars One Base, but the big                           one you spotted is turning south. It                           shouldn t be a factor.                 Beck takes a breath, smiles.                                       BECK                          We re all pretty excited here and                           we re sure you must be feeling the                           same. Enjoy your meal and get a good                           night s sleep. We anticipate that                           tomorrow morning you will be Go for                           Mars Orbital Insertion.                 INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. DAY                 WHOOPS OF JOY from McConnell s crew. Woody and Terri high                 five each other.

NIGHT                 The lighting is subdued for a sleep period, but everyone s                 too restless. There s a low HUM of equipment.                 INT. EVA AIRLOCK. NIGHT                 Terri and Phil are playing computer Monopoly under a single                 light. Terri is using touch-screen technology to move her                 piece. She glances at Phil. He has spread some M&Ms out,                 letting them drift in mid-air as he performs his ritual                 weeding out of the red ones. She shakes her head.                                       TERRI                          What if you opened up your meal packs                           and found that, instead of putting                           in everything but red ones, they d                           made a mistake and put in only red                           ones?                                       PHIL                          Hey, that s a funny notion. And what                           if in your meal packs, instead of                           brown rice, there were spring-loaded                           spikes that shot into your eyes?                                       TERRI                               (pause)                          How did you ever pass the psych                           evaluation?                                       PHIL                          When you re schizophrenic, they take                           the higher score.                 He touches the screen to roll the dice.                 INT. MARS RECOVERY. LOWER HAB. NIGHT                 McConnell, in his cubicle, looks away from the photo of                 Maggie. Haunted by memories. He rises, flips through the CDs                 in a storage case, pulls one out. He holds this carefully,                 hesitating, then feeds it into his computer. Immediately his                 screen saver vanishes and we see                 HOME VIDEO OF A PARTY                 An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a                 semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit                 jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand,                 everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil,                 Cote, Kirov, others. They re watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE,                 shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody.                 THE FIRST PHOTO                 Is of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling                 in front of a Christmas tree. He s grinning ecstatically as                 he holds up a brand new model rocket.                                       LUKE                          Jim s first ship was seriously                           underpowered...                 LAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad                 haircut and the pajamas.                 THE SECOND PHOTO                 Is of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing                 on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a                 telescope on its tripod.                                       WOODY                          Maggie was always starstruck...                 More LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and                 braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the                 adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth,                 leaning into each other, looking very happy.                                       MAGGIE                          I ll get you guys for this.                 More LAUGHTER. Everyone s having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA                 swings back towards the TV screen as                 THIRD PHOTO APPEARS                 Jim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a                 fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand.                 Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.                                       LUKE                          When they met at the Air Force                           Academy, it was  love at first                           flight.                  GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers.                                       WOODY                          After that, NASA training was tough.                           All Jim could think about was                           exploring a heavenly body. More ribald                           LAUGHTER, as                 FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS                 Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in                 space suits.                                       LUKE                          But Maggie, as you can see, kept him                           on a short leash. Until...                 A FIFTH PHOTO                 Shows McConnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss                 Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.                                       WOODY                          Mission accomplished!                 ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT                 As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS,                 the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he s not                 alone. He looks up.                 WOODY                 Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They                 both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.                 IN THE VIDEO                 Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at                 the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves                 his hands, hushing everybody.                                       LUKE                          Today we celebrate a new chapter in                           their story. And guys, it s a pretty                           historic one.                 Both men raise champagne flutes.                                       WOODY                          Let s hear it for the newly-announced                           Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One.                           To Jim and Maggie!                 CHEERS at this, repeats of  Jim and Maggie!  Luke grins,                 giving a little signal, and we see                 A FINAL PHOTO                 Of Maggie in Jim s arms, both of them in goofy tropical                 vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf                 somewhere, but here it s been crudely superimposed onto a                 Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image.                                       LUKE                          When you guys land, it ll prove once                           and for all there s no intelligent                           life on Mars.                 More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to                 protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri                 sits nearby.                                       MAGGIE                          Hey, c mon, what if I m right?                                       ASSORTED VOICES                          Oh no, here we go! Don t get her                           started! Somebody put on some music!                                       MAGGIE                          It s our sister planet!                                       PHIL                          Oh brother!                 LAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She s a good sport.                                       TERRI                          Maggie, why does this have to be                           about us? Mars is a great opportunity                           for pure science.                                       MAGGIE                          We ll do the science. And we ll do                           it very well. That s what we ve                           trained for. But what if there s                           more...? In all our myths, in every                           human culture, Mars has always held                           a special attraction. What if that                           means something? Only we don t                           understand it yet...                 The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up                 in Maggie s spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO                 CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.                                       MAGGIE                          The universe is not chaos. It s                           connection. Life reaches out for                           life...                 She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.                                       MAGGIE                          This is what we were born for, isn t                           it? To stand on a new world, and                           look beyond it to the next one. It s                           who we are.                 A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her                 passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn t                 meant to get so carried away.                 IN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL                 Reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen.                 He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.                                       WOODY                          You okay?                                       MCCONNELL                          Yeah. I m good to go.                 Woody glances at him. It s true. Rather than being saddened,                 McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed                 sense of wonder.                                       MCCONNELL                          After all these years... Can you                           believe it? Tomorrow we ll be standing                           on Mars.                 Woody nods, smiles.                                       WOODY                          You know what? She may have been                           right.                 McConnell looks at him.                                       WOODY                          If that wasn t a quake down there,                           then something else caused it. Or                           planned it... You re thinking the                           same thing.                                       MCCONNELL                          It s never been out of my mind.                                       WOODY                          Jesus. You realize what this means?                 McConnell nods. Looks again at Maggie s face on the screen.                                       MCCONNELL                          She knew, Woody. She was the only                           one of us that ever thought there                           might be something down there.                                       WOODY                          Yeah, and we re not leaving until we                           find out... Deal?                 McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody                 turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning                 back. One last thought, and he doesn t know he s going to                 say it until it comes out.                                       WOODY                          Maggie was the best of us.                 McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes.                 McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on                 the screen.                 INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT                 MARS LOOMS AHEAD OF US.

There s a sudden LOUD, BRITTLE POP from somewhere overhead,                 and Phil s gloved hand, hovering over a computer screen, is                 punctured through and through. The screen itself is holed                 and spiderwebbed with a loud CRACK!                                       PHIL                          Uhhh!                 PHIL HOLDS UP HIS HAND                 As he and Terri stare at it, dumbfounded. Thick droplets of                 blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards                 the venting puncture in the hull over head. The astronauts                  helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.                                       TERRI                          What in God s --                 Suddenly we hear HIGH PITCHED ALARMS SOUNDING, then the                 PINGING OF MORE TINY MISSILES, slashing across the ship s                 outer skin.                 WOODY AND MCCONNELL                 Are staring back from the cockpit, reacting in astonishment                 to Phil s drifting blood and to the alarms. Then Woody                 suddenly understands.                                       WOODY                          Micrometeoroids                                       MCCONNELL                               (scanning sensors)                          Breach hits in the hull!                 ANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL                 As she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding.                 He s staring at a gauge.                                       PHIL                          Outgassing! Losing pressure!                                       TERRI                          Woody, seal the breech!                 ANGLE ON WOODY                 As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the                 EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks                 this open pulling out a                 PATCH GUN                 Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track                 THE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD                 Which give a telltale hint of the puncture s location,                 somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the  ceiling.                  WOODY PUSHES OFF                 Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a                 shattered faceplate -- its label reads  MCCONNELL  -- to                 REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling                 insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here,                 going into the vacuum of space.                 Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the                 puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS,                 ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then                 abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail.                                       WOODY                          Kill those alarms!                 McConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all                 strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But                 the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared.                 The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon.                 PHIL S BLOOD DROPLETS                 Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in                 the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster                 and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core                 tunnel that leads to the lower Hab.                 MCCONNELL                 Stares at a gauge that confirms what s happening.                                       MCCONNELL                          Still outgassing in the lower Hab!                           There must be another hole down there,                           even bigger.                                       PHIL                          Losing pressure fast!

Phil punches                 keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him.                                       PHIL                          It s already starting.

Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more                 calm than he really feels.

Jim, you ve got the ship.                           I m going EVA.                 They stare at him, stunned by their immense task.

MOMENTS LATER                 Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody s helmet on him, but                 something s in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into                 his suit, pulls out...                 THE CHAIN                 From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship                 dangling.                 WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI                 As they share a brief, loving glance, but there s no time                 for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his                 gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards                 the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock                 switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look.                 At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential                 power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on                 line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful.                                       PHIL                          Jesus, it s still bleeding.

NIGHT                 The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody                 drifts through it into space. He s now wearing the MMU, an                 oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle                 astronauts.                 INT. EVA ROOM.

MCCONNELL                 Floats up to them, checking on Phil s work at the computer.                                       TERRI                          Jim, you ve gotta get your spare                           helmet from storage.                                       MCCONNELL                          No time.

MCCONNELL                          I ll do it from below.                                       TERRI                          We re losing pressure.

McConnell looks at her, knows she s right. But he starts off                 anyway. Phil reaches out his good hand.                                       PHIL                          Jim, I ve got an idea. If you guys                           can save enough atmosphere, I ll                           disconnect the power in the main                           computer bay, then jump start the                           systems. I ll do a hard boot.                 This is a radical, incredibly risky notion. McConnell stares                 hard at Phil. So does Terri.                                       MCCONNELL                          Has that ever been tested?                                       PHIL                          Are you kidding? These machines are                           much too valuable.                 McConnell looks from Terri to Phil. It s life and death.                                       MCCONNELL                          Do it.                 Then he turns, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS MCCONNELL as he pushes                 away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel,                 heading towards the                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.

MCCONNELL                 Is also jarred by the firing of the thrusters. The rotation                 slows until the Hab is still. Zero-G. McConnell floats.

She catches the drifting can, confused. When McConnell speaks                 again, he s gasping for air.

Terri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell                 watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught                 by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the  ceiling  of the                 outer hull, like a miniature tornado.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 EXT. SPACE.

THE SODA STREAM                 Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that s now                 being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She                 can now see the ugly puncture for the first time.

He s deathly pale.                 EXT. SPACE. NIGHT                 Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting                 out of the hull of the lower Hab.

NIGHT                 Terri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down                 to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister,                 pushing the plastic mask over McConnell s face.

As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer                 bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges                 are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart,                 streaking into electronic snow. He shoots a tense glance at                 THE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR                 Which is flickering crazily. It shows the ship moving much                 closer to its critical MOI point, indicated by a flashing                 red triangle aimed down at the Martian surface.

All of a sudden Woody s thrusters cut out. The ship is moving                 by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls.                 Nothing.                 Then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him,                 the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to                 move to the hole.

NIGHT                 McConnell, holding his breath, grabs a patch gun from a                 storage locker. Terri s still got the 0-2 cannister. He nods                 to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping                 weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the  ceiling.                  They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been                 only partially dammed by the soda ice.                 INT. COCKPIT.

SHRILL WHINES,                 ELECTRONIC CRACKLES from all around him, as the systems are                 abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be                 mishandled.

NIGHT                 In the Hab, Terri uses the base of the 0-2 cannister to smash                 away the interior ice chunk, then McConnell, who s getting                 wobbly again, blasts the hole with the epoxy gun. As he works,                 Terri gives him another hit of air.                                       COMPUTER                          Twenty percent atmosphere...

CLOSE ON THE PATCH                 As it changes color and shrinks, drawing itself down into                 the metal of the hull.                 INT. COCKPIT.

But as he reaches                 this, about to re-enter the ship, he s captured momentarily                 by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.                 SUNRISE OVER MARS                 As the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly                 glory. It s so close now that individual features can be                 seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris,                 and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the                 Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle.                 WOODY                 Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side                 of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very                 long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.                                       WOODY                          Hey, Beautiful...                 Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through                 the EVA hatch.                 CAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark                 sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a                 row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There s a                 good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower.                 Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME...                 WE MOVE IN CLOSER                 On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we                 see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of                 the eraser at the end of a pencil.

DAY                 As Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat,                 McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just                 look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce                 hug.

Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up                 Phil s hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat                 and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.

He scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately.                 Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own                 eyes. His voice catches for a moment.                                       PHIL                          I don t know what you re getting so                           cocky about.

Try to close your fingers, Phil,                           nice and slowly.                 Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains                 extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this                 for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar                 panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are                 smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing                 pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like                 a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship,                 including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded,                 charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes                 what s left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit --                 to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars.

PHIL                               (softly, sadly)                          Earth.                                       TERRI                               (beat)                          Hey. When we get back? We really                           will have to try this in the sim.                 He tries to smile. So does she.                                       MCCONNELL                          How we doin  on fuel, Woody?                 Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.                                       WOODY                          I m at fifty percent.                               (looking down)                          But I don t see the REMO.                 THEIR POV                 Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black                 space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them.                 TERRI                 Happens to glance directly below.                                       TERRI                          There she is!                 THEIR POV                 The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against                 the red of Mars.                                       WOODY                          Jesus. She s not where I thought                           she d be.                                       PHIL                          We re going to miss her.                 WOODY                 Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.                                       MCCONNELL                          What do you think?                                       WOODY                          We can t catch it. Not like this.                                       MCCONNELL                               (thinking quickly)                          Use the tether.                 From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out...                 THE TETHER GUN                 About the size of a large flare gun. There s a carabiner-                like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun.                                       MCCONNELL                          We ll only have one, maybe two shots                           before she s out of reach.                                       WOODY                          It ll be better if I leave you the                           gun while I run out to the REMO.                           I ve got enough fuel left for that.                                       MCCONNELL                          You ll be going too fast.                                       WOODY                          I ll aim to overshoot, then brake                           like hell; arc it in.                 McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is,                 and they also know it s their only chance. Woody flips a                 switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes,                 trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands                 McConnell the gun.                                       WOODY                          Seeya in a few.                 McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender,                 loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at                 full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the                 tether gun.                 WOODY AND THE REMO                 Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It s as if he were in                 an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway.                 Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He                 checks his armpad display screen.                                       WOODY                          Okay. I m on path to overshoot. I m                           gonna take the edge off.                 Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he                 can.                 CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS                 Glowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off.                 WOODY S EYES                 Show alarm. He checks his display.                                       WOODY                          I m out. Coming in hot. Still long.                               (beat)                          Abandoning the unit. I ll brake with                           suit jets.                 Woody hits some buttons and the MMU s latches snap open. He                 grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes                 himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets.                 WOODY S POV                 He s still going very quickly.                 WITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL                 Floating close together. The tether line is still unspooling                 from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as                 he races towards the REMO. Terri s heart is in her throat.                                       TERRI                          Oh Jesus. Jesus...                 McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm.                 BACK ON WOODY                 Still speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out.                                       WOODY                          Suit jets gone. But I m gonna make                           contact...                 MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL                 Stare at Woody s distant figure.                 INTERCUT --                                       MCCONNELL                          At what velocity?                                       WOODY                          Impact s gonna be a little rough.                                       MCCONNELL                          At what velocity?                                       WOODY                               (beat)                          Thirty-two.                 A look between McConnell and Terri; her face is stricken.                                       MCCONNELL                          I m gonna use the gun to slow you.                                       WOODY                          No! You slow me and I ll fall short.                                       MCCONNELL                          It s too fast, Woody.                                       WOODY                          No choice. I ll be okay. Here we                           go...                 WOODY AND THE REMO                 Woody s coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers                 an hour. He holds the hook out in front of him with one hand                 while grabbing the tether line with the other, and WHAM! --                 he crashes into the REMO.                 WOODY S HAND                 Slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the REMO.                 IT CONNECTS --                 WOODY                 Tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is too                 much.                 HIS GLOVED HANDS                 Are ripped from the line.                 WOODY                 Slides over the hull of the REMO.                 HIS HANDS                 Grasp in vain for something to grab onto. They drag and bump                 and then finally his fingers close on... empty space.                 WOODY                 Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.                 BACK ON MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL                 As Terri screams.                                       TERRI                          Woody!!                 McConnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel                 them quickly in towards the REMO.                 WOODY                 Tries his suit jets again -- they re empty.                 HIS POV                 Falling away from the REMO.                 MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS                 Are being reeled towards the REMO by the tether line. Another                 couple hundred meters to go.                                       MCCONNELL                          Woody, what s your status?                 INTERCUTTING --                                       WOODY                               (after a beat)                          Uh, well, no suit jets and I m still                           carrying a good deal of velocity.                                       MCCONNELL                          As soon as we get hooked up, I ll                           come get you.                                       WOODY                               (after a beat)                          Uh, I d have to say negative on that,                           Jim.                                       MCCONNELL                          Negative on the transmission?                                       WOODY                          No, I heard you. Negative on the                           maneuver. I am not retrievable.                 McConnell and Terri share a quick, anguished look.                                       TERRI                          Woody, that s not possible. You re                           not going that fast.                                       WOODY                          It comes down to the amount of fuel,                           honey. The suit jets were designed                           for attitude control, not travel.                           Retrieval just won t work.                                       PHIL                          It has to work!                                       WOODY                          Hey, believe me, I don t like it any                           more than you do.                                       TERRI                          Woody --                                       WOODY                          Run the numbers, Jim.                                       MCCONNELL                          I am.                 McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display                 pad. Terri is staring at him. When McConnell s eyes meet                 hers, they are red-rimmed. Haunted.                                       MCCONNELL                          Woody, you hang tight. We ll get                           into the REMO, fire her up, drop her                           into a lower orbit and come scoop                           you up.                                       WOODY                          Sounds good, Jim.                                       TERRI                          It s gonna take half an hour to get                           the REMO reoriented! Woody ll be...                           He ll be in the atmosphere by then!                                       MCCONNELL                          Then we ll have to get her moving                           faster.

It s a                           good plan.                                       TERRI                          No! We are going to --                                       PHIL                          Oh Jesus, look! The ship!                 Phil points. McConnell and Terri look.                 THE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT                 Is now several kilometers below and behind them. It s glowing                 red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant                 fireball, devoured by friction with Mars  atmosphere.                 MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE                 Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to                 look up again. He sees something alarming.                                       MCCONNELL                          Look out!                 THEIR POV                 They are drifting quickly into the REMO.                                       MCCONNELL                          Brakes!                 ALL THREE                 Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang                 into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They                 find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the                 tether gun.                 THE HOOK                 Releases from the REMO s hull. McConnell hits another button                 and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already                 scrabbling at a latch on the REMO s outer airlock door.                                       MCCONNELL                          Okay, let s get inside! Phil, start                           dumping the cargo, or there won t be                           room for us.                                       PHIL                          But we need those supplies for --                                       MCCONNELL                          Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!                 WOODY                 Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that                 Terri has reached it safely.                                       WOODY                          Will do, Jim.                 He turns to look at...                 MARS                 Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.                                       WOODY                               (softly)                          Hey, Beautiful...                 BACK AT THE REMO                 Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from                 McConnell s surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO.                 McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.                                       MCCONNELL                          Terri, no!                 But it s too late. She s already out of reach, and now fires                 her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO.                 MCCONNELL                 Is reaching to activate his own jets, when                 PHIL S HAND                 Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They                 stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half-                maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.                                       MCCONNELL                          Goddammit, Terri, it won t work!                 But Terri keeps on going.                 WOODY                 Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars.                 Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.                                       WOODY                          Terri, what are you doing?                 INTERCUT --                                       TERRI                          I ll tell you what I m not doing,                           Woody. I m not going to watch you                           die.                                       WOODY                          Terri --                                       TERRI                          You d do the same for me.                 AT THE REMO                 Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle                 of Woody s suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil                 looks at McConnell, anguished.                                       MCCONNELL                          Get inside. Dump the cargo, then                           start the systems.                               (Phil hesitates)                          Now.                 INTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI                 As Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice.                                       WOODY                          No. I wouldn t come for you. Not if                           it just wasn t possible.                                       TERRI                          I can do it!                                       WOODY                          No, Terri, you can t! You don t have                           enough fuel to get me, stop us both,                           and get us back. Hell, you come any                           farther and you won t have enough to                           get back yourself.                 No response from Terri.                                       WOODY                          Listen to me, goddammit! You have to                           stop! You have to stop now!                                       MCCONNELL                          He s right, Terri... It s no use.                 Terri looks at her armpad display.                 CLOSE ON DISPLAY SCREEN                 As her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to...                 TERRI                 Releases her thumb from the toggle control.                 HER SUIT JETS                 Stop firing.                 TERRI                 Drifts, staring towards Woody.                 TERRI AND WOODY                 Are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only                 about a hundred meters apart. But it might as well be                 infinity.                                       WOODY                          Okay, honey...? You gotta go back                           now.                                       TERRI                          The hell I do.                 Terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger.                 THE HOOK                 Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.                 WOODY                 Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.                 PLATE POV -- MOVING -- AS                 Woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer,                 and then SNAP! -- the hook stops. ANGLE ON THE TETHER GUN                 The wire has run all the way out.                 WOODY                 Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from                 him. His only life preserver.                 TERRI                 Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into                 the gun.                                       WOODY                          What are you doing?                                       TERRI                          I m gonna jet a little closer and                           try again.                                       WOODY                          Terri, you spend any fuel getting                           closer, you won t get back, and if                           anyone tries to get you, they ll die                           too.                 No response from Terri.                 THE HOOK                 Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun. Woody s voice                 cracks; he s very close to tears. Pleading now.                                       WOODY                          Honey, please go back. Go back and                           help everyone get down to the surface.                 The hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun. Terri                 resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury.                                       TERRI                          I am not losing you.                                       WOODY                          I can t let you do it. I can t. I m                           sorry.                 TERRI                 Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something                 different in his voice now, a terrible resolve...                                       TERRI                          Woody...?                 WOODY                 Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.                                       WOODY                          I love you, Terri. God how I love                           you.                 He unscrews the ring, pops the seal. The outrush of air pushes                 his helmet all the way off. Woody shuts his eyes and opens                 his mouth.                                       TERRI                          Woody, nooooooo...!!!                 Ice crystals bloom with Woody s last breath. There s nothing                 to suck in. He doesn t fight it. He lets death come.                 ANGLE ON TERRI                 Tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic.                                       TERRI                          Woody, oh Woody, please God, no!                 HER THUMB                 Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell s voice,                 from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he s aged fifty                 years in the blink of an eye.                                       MCCONNELL                          Come back, Terri.                 Terri s thumb is still poised. Death would be better.                 ANGLE ON MCCONNELL                 Outside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside,                 staring out anxiously towards Terri.                                       MCCONNELL                               (quietly, simply)                          He s gone.                 He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri.                                       MCCONNELL                          Please, Terri...                               (long beat)                          We need you.                 TERRI S THUMB                 Pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward.                 TERRI S FACE                 Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself                 around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO.                 INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY                 On the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled                  MARS RECOVERY  is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer                 figures crawls beside it.                 SUPER TITLE:  SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG                  Beck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset                 data.                                       NEW CAPCOM                          Okay, they re Go for the burn and                           MOI. Should be initiating the burn                           just about... now.                 Suddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks,                 breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing                 Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes.                 A moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising                 babble of scared, confused voices.                 RAY BECK                 Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His                 face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place,                 right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a                 row...                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:                 EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT                 The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes,                 packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside.                 The hatch is sealed.                 INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT                 McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He s anguished, haunted by                 the image of Woody s death. We see him struggling to overcome                 his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate                 on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has                 been opened; he s facing                 SMALL UTILITY MONITOR                 Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator                 lights, com ports.                 MCCONNELL                 Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He s holding a                 palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins                 tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He                 turns, looking back at                 TERRI AND PHIL                 Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land.                 They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this                 tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned                 operation. It s claustrophobic, bitterly cold.                 PHIL S FACE                 Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and                 fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer                 supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.                 TERRI                 Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She s in shock.                 MCCONNELL                 Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.                                       MCCONNELL                          Phil?                               (no response)                          Hey, Phil...?                 Phil looks up at him dully.                                       MCCONNELL                          We re going in blind. We ll deploy                           the chutes by laptop. I need to get                           on the data bus, put in a software                           patch, and try to soften this tin                           can s landing. I could use your help                           with the patch.                 After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards                 McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats,                 then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to                 tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.                                       MCCONNELL                          That s great. Good job.                               (turning to Terri)                          Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think                           maybe we could rig some kind of                           seatbelts out of those cargo straps?                 Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her                 hand, as if she s never seen it before. Dully she reaches                 for another one, begins looping them together.                 MCCONNELL                 Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can t                 push them too hard, too fast. They re moving like robots,                 but at least they re moving.                 EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER)                 Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position                 for entry into the atmosphere.                 Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it                 falls away from us, towards Mars at night.                 INT. REMO. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT                 The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri s jury-rigged                 strap system, hold on for dear life. The buffeting through                 the atmosphere is shaking them violently.                 BEHIND THEIR FACEPLATES                 We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted,                 unable to focus their eyes. Each of them thinking, once again:                 Now I m going to die...                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT                 The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some                 desolate, otherwordly ghost town. And then, in the night sky                 beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright                 streak of red as the REMO slashes down into the Martian                 atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind                 distant mountains. Then all is stillness again, deathly                 stillness and silence...                 INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. VIEWPORT. DAY                 Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. He s just                 lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this                 disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the                 certain end of his own career. He doesn t, at first, even                 hear the nearby VOICE.                                       NEW CAPCOM                          Ray...? We ve got some new data,                           just coming in.                 Beck looks up, his eyes red-rimmed. The CapCom shifts                 uneasily. He s holding a computer printout.                                       NEW CAPCOM                          We just -- it doesn t make any sense.                           We re not sure how to read this.                                       BECK                          Data?                                       NEW CAPCOM                          Yes sir. Telemetry reports the REMO                           has left its orbit and reached the                           Martian surface.                                       BECK                               (pause)                          Crashed?                                       NEW CAPCOM                          No sir. Under power.                 Beck snatches the paper, staring at it. For the first time                 we see some life coming back into him.                                       BECK                          When?                                       NEW CAPCOM                          Sixty-three minutes after Mars                           Recovery went off-line. Sir, the                           graph reads like a controlled descent.                           But that doesn t make any --                 Beck suddenly understands. And it s a joy to see his face,                 the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes.                                       BECK                          They used the REMO as a lander.                 The CapCom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of                 hope.                                       BECK                          It s McConnell, it s got to be! Nobody                           else could have pulled this off. Son                           of a bitch! They re alive.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 EXT. MARTIAN SURFACE. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY                 POV ANGLE - WIDE                 As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the                 distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff,                 the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.                 PANNING                 We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well                 as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse,                 and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant                 are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by                 micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze.                 And finally,                 CLOSER TO CAMERA                 We see the camp s American flag, still on its toppled pole,                 but nearly obliterated by sand.                 ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL                 Who are spooked by this desolation. They ve paused at the                 edge of the camp.                 They have dragged along with them from their landing site a                 crude sledge, improvised from the REMO s hatch cover and                 some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.                 McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he s got to keep                 their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing                 off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the                 ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a                 moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost,                 they have made it to Mars.                 When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved.                                       MCCONNELL                          Better?                                       PHIL                               (pause)                          Damn right.                                       MCCONNELL                          Terri, let s see if that oxygen still                           is operational. Phil, you better                           check out the ERV. I ll take the                           Hab. If you find Luke s --                 He catches himself. Phil and Terri look at him.                                       MCCONNELL                          Just keep in touch.                 EXT. ERV. DAY                 Phil steps from the umber sand onto the ERV s ladder, begins                 to climb. The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high                 against its tires.                 EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY                 Terri kneels by the oxygen still, begins to scoop away sand                 with her gloved hands. She still looks numb.                 EXT. HAB. DAY                                       MCCONNELL                               (on radio)                          I m at the main airlock door.                 He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs                 it. After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks                 open. Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle.                                       MCCONNELL                          Entering Hab.                 EXT. ERV. DAY                 Perched atop the ERV s ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered                 drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover.                 He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand.                                       PHIL                          I ve got ERV access. I m going in.                           Terri, you okay?                 EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY                 Terri is still scooping sand. She s just cleared the first                 row of gauges.                                       TERRI                          Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to                           get back to 100% capacity.                 INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY                 McConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He                 pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew                 taped their final, fateful message.                 HIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE                 Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle.                 Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the                 corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins,                 startled, and sees                 HIS OWN REFLECTION.                 In his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the                 screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera                 the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets.                 MCCONNELL SHIVERS                 This place is filled with ghosts.                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY                 Phil, in the pilot s seat of the ERV, pushes a computer s                 power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling                 him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy                 static.                                       PHIL                          ERV appears structurally intact.                           Computers are fried, just as we                           thought.                 EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY                 Terri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her                 heels, studying the tangle of pipes.                                       TERRI                          Copy that. I ve got busted filters                           here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup                           job, but so far no major damage.                 INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY                 AN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS.                 THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV                 On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants                 have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are                 even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on                 the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through                 pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever                 assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.                 MCCONNELL                 Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up                 before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication,                 he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.                 Blinking red letters read  25 deg. C.  And something else --                 the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly                 deflate, revealing his arm s shape. There s air pressure in                 here!                 MCCONNELL                 Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:                  Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%.                  MCCONNELL                 Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He                 hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful                 of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment                 he doesn t trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards                 his helmet.                                       MCCONNELL                          I m in the greenhouse. You better...                           you better come see this for                           yourselves.                 INT. ERV. DAY                 Phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through                 a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse.                                       PHIL                          What is it?                 There s no answer. He rises.                 EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY                 Terri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant,                 translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell s shadowy figure                 can be seen, moving slowly.                                       TERRI                          Jim...?                 INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY                 McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing                 through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping                 foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he                 looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled,                 jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has                 come into play. He pauses, looking up...                 Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic                 tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in                 the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water                 wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with                 duct tape, like some giant Erector set.                 As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged                 figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with                 a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.                 McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights                 back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as                 he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a                 glimpse of the almost unrecognizable                 LUKE GRAHAM                 Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying                 curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above                 a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together.                 In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high                 overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell s skull.                 McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.                                       MCCONNELL                          Luke, it s me! Jim McConnell!                 We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke s eyes. Then he yanks                 his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles                 in the air.                                       LUKE                          You re not here!                                       MCCONNELL                          Luke, it s Jim!                                       LUKE                          No, no, you re not... you can t be                           here.                                       MCCONNELL                          Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby!                           You were reading Treasure Island                           with him...!                 As he stares down at McConnell, Luke s eyes finally light up                 with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from                 behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped                 from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell                 scrambles to his feet.                                       MCCONNELL                          Don t hurt him!                 McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil                 that it s okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off                 their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.                 Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after                 another, as if still not quite certain whether they might                 vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.                                       LUKE                          Phil... Terri...                 Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell.                                       LUKE                          Jim... I don t understand. You re                           not supposed to be here... Why are                           you here? Where s Woody?                                       MCCONNELL                          He didn t make it Luke.                 Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He                 looks to Terri, who looks down.                                       LUKE                          Oh no.                 Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on                 himself. It s all too much for him to take in. McConnell                 kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.

DAY (MINUTES LATER)                 Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented                 sleeping area he s created in one corner of the greenhouse.                 Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested                 vegetables and greens. The others crouch around him.                                       MCCONNELL                          Luke, what happened here?                 A flash of fear in Luke s eyes.                                       LUKE                               (whispers)                          We fired the radar. It came. They                           all died.                                       MCCONNELL                          What came?                                       LUKE                          They all died, but I was spared.                           Why? Had to be for a reason. Then,                           all of a sudden, I knew why I was                           spared.                 His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.                                       LUKE                          So somebody would be left to figure                           out the secret.                 He taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice.                 The others exchange an uneasy glance.                                       MCCONNELL                          Luke, we still don t understand.                                       LUKE                          Come. Comecomecome.                 He rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand,                 without waiting to see if they ll follow. McConnell, Terri                 and Phil stare after him for a long moment. Phil breaks the                 silence.                                       PHIL                          Is it just me?

MCCONNELL                          Or maybe his whole crew died and                           he s been marooned alone on Mars.                           Let s give him time to adjust.                 McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Phil,                 trailing, mutters to himself.

DAY                 Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking                 helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised                 sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil                 walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear                 Luke over his RADIO.                                       LUKE                          So... let me be sure I understand                           this. Your ship blew up, with all                           its supplies. Then you emptied the                           cargo out of the REMO, and it was                           totalled on landing. You ve got no                           food, no water, no spare oxygen,                           nothing but what I see here...?                 McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then                 McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.                                       LUKE                          What kinda rescue mission is this?                                       MCCONNELL                          That kind.                 He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off                 a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.                                       PHIL                          Check it out. New nav boards for the                           ERV.

In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody s death seems                 to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by the                 shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze.                                       LUKE                          Terri... I m so sorry. He was a good                           man.

He looks at the others.                                       LUKE                          This way.                 He starts off across the sand, and they follow.                 EXT. GRAVE SITE. DAY                 They stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as                 Luke completes his account of the disaster.                                       LUKE                          ...When I came to and dug myself out                           of the sand, my faceplate was cracked.                           Leaking badly. I barely made it back                           to Base. It was weeks before I could                           work up the nerve to go back out                           there and look for their...

But it didn t seem right, somehow,                           to dig just one grave.                 There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps.                 He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust                 around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke s gaze.                                       MCCONNELL                          Has it been blowing like this for a                           while?                               (Luke nods)                          We saw a big storm from space. But                           Micker said it was turning south.                 Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he                 seems to see.                                       LUKE                          If it holds course.                 McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at                 Luke.                                       MCCONNELL                          This -- whatever it was -- this force.                           You say it came directly out of the                           top of the mountain?                                       LUKE                          You don t believe me. That s okay.                           But I m not crazy, Jim.                 McConnell isn t quite sure how to reply to this.                                       MCCONNELL                          What did you mean by its  secret?                            What secret?

It s very cold in here; their breath is frosty.                 THEIR POV --                 The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many                 locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and                 diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated                 maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of                 the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.                                       LUKE                          See, where they made their mistake                           was, they must ve planned for it to                           be visible from Earth...                 The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric                 space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs                 his hands together, poised over the keyboard.                                       MCCONNELL                          Who s  they ?                 Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery                 feverish intensity, a secret excitement.

You ve                           got erosion, sand storms, lava flows,                           meteor impacts -- hell, in that much                           time, the whole surface would ve                           changed.

That s what made me                           realize it s a pattern -- a repeating                           pattern.                                       MCCONNELL                          Mathematical?                 Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very                 quickly. He s been waiting so long to share this.                                       LUKE                          That s what I thought. There are                           distinct blocks in the pattern, and                           within each block the tones come in                           groups of three. Threethreethree.                           For months I struggled to analyze                           it, trying different constructs...                           Then I thought about dimensions.                                       MCCONNELL                          X-Y-Z coordinates...                                       LUKE                          Right! Three groups equals three                           dimensions... So I tried assigning                           different graphic values to each                           block, group and tone. And finally I                           got... this.                 He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the                 glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again.

Damn close.                                       TERRI                          The difference between a man and an                           ape is less than three percent of                           genetic material.

Then all four turn, stare again at the                 slowly rotating DNA, pondering its awesome mystery.                 MCCONNELL                 When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen.                 We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery                 has on his imagination.                                       MCCONNELL                          It s been a long day.

Phil, your                           first priority will be to get the                           motherboards over to the ERV.                           Concentrate on getting communications                           up first.                               (Phil nods)                          Soon as we ve got the juice, we ll                           send a packet to Micker, tell them                           Luke s OK, and that... everything                           else that s happened. The rest of us                           will take an inventory of supplies,                           see where we stand. Okay?                 The others nod in weary agreement. As they start out, towards                 the relative warmth of the greenhouse, Terri looks at Luke,                 at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair. She smiles,                 brushing some locks off his forehead.                                       TERRI                          C mon.

NEXT MORNING                 As in the Science Area, this space has enough thin oxygen                 for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted. McConnell and Luke                 are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from                 the REMO.                 Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek.                 His beard is gone, his hair neatly trimmed. McConnell enjoys                 Luke s own wonder at his transformation.

McConnell, rummaging through Phil s backpack, drops an already-                opened bag of M&Ms. The CANDIES scatter and bounce all over                 the floor.

LATE DAY                 McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he                 pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks,                 then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the                 image starts to sharpen.

THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS                 Stare at the ominous sight. They re all more nervous than                 they want to show.

LATE DAY                 Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially                 shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun                 swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire.                 INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY                 Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid                 of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively                 down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods.                 Luke s hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of                 awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who                 finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY                 From the radar gun on Ares-8 s back, a sharp, high-pitched                 electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as                 it s fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops.                 For a moment nothing happens.                 Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining                 sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains.                 ANGLE ON THE FACE                 As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins                 to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding                 out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement                 is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises,                 it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face.                 No inside details can be seen.                 INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY                 McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon,                 awed. They re barely breathing.                                       PHIL                          Oh my God...                                       LUKE                          It worked... It worked!                                       MCCONNELL                          Check for radiation.                 Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout.                                       LUKE                          Normal. Seismic... normal. Anemometer                           steady. No sign of the vortex.                                       PHIL                          I don t know what we did, but guys --                           does that look to you like a hostile                           gesture?                                       TERRI                          No. More like an invitation.                                       LUKE                          Or another test...                 McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face,                 a growing look of determination.                                       MCCONNELL                          Luke, the four-man rover. Does it                           still work?                 The others look at him, their expressions changing as they                 realize what he s implying.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. LATE DAY                 McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock.                 Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has                 picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off                 in astonishment towards                 A FRIGHTENING SIGHT                 The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into                 purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above.                 The DUST STORM has turned their way; it s now sixty kilometers                 away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand                 meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand-                kilometer front.                 THE ASTRONAUTS                 Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to                 Luke, whose expression is grim.                                       MCCONNELL                          How long before it hits?                                       LUKE                          An hour? Maybe less.                                       MCCONNELL                          How bad?                                       LUKE                          A storm like that? It could go                           planetary. And last a year.                 McConnell stares at him.                                       LUKE                          It ll sock us in, Jim. We won t be                           able to take off. If that happens,                           with what few supplies we ve got                           left...? We ll starve to death.                 McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The                 others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again.                 There s the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting.                                       MCCONNELL                          Phil, how much longer to prep the                           ERV?                                       PHIL                          Maybe forty-five minutes. It ll be                           tight, but we can make it.                                       MCCONNELL                          Then there s still time for us to                           get out there and back.                 He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other.                 Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.                                       MCCONNELL                          Stay here. Continue the repair. If                           something goes wrong, you get out of                           here before that storm hits.                                       PHIL                          Go back... alone?                                       MCCONNELL                          If we re not back in forty-five                           minutes, I want you to prep and                           launch.                               (looks at his armpad                                display)                          That s 1950 hours.                                       PHIL                          Jim --                                       MCCONNELL                          It s not a suggestion, it s an order.                           You understand?                                       PHIL                               (reluctantly)                          I understand. But --                                       MCCONNELL                          You understand what?                                       PHIL                          If you re not back by 1950, I prep                           and launch.                 McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke.                                       MCCONNELL                          Let s go.                 They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more                 thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil                 stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.                 EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DUSK                 In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across                 the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the                 storm approaches from that direction. It s marching                 relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning                 now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes                 spinning off near its purple-black base...                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK                 Phil has panels off. He s reaching into the guts of the main                 computer, working feverishly. His repair kit is beside him.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. DUSK                 In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and                 its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light                 is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover                 arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels.                 GROUND LEVEL SHOT                 Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the                 Face. The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the                 white light strains our eyes. The three astronauts ENTER                 FRAME as we see them, from behind, staring up.                 ON THE ASTRONAUTS  AWED FACES                 As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic                 mystery before them. Luke and Terri look at McConnell. Another                 moment of critical decision. He keys his mike.                                       MCCONNELL                          Phil, do you read me?                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK                 Phil keys his own mike.                                       PHIL                          Yeah, Jim. Your signal s breaking up                           a little in the storm, but I read                           you.                 EXT. THE FACE. DUSK                 McConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light.                                       MCCONNELL                          We re at the Face. We re gonna need                           a few minutes here. Same deadline,                           launch at 1950. With or without us.                           Do you copy?                                       PHIL                               (pause)                          Copy that.                 Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance.                                       TERRI                          Jim, are you sure you want to do                           this?                                       MCCONNELL                          I m not sure of anything anymore.                           But I didn t come a hundred million                           miles just to turn back in the last                           ten feet.                 Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal.                 McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of                 them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath.                 Then they walk forward together, into the light.                 INT. THE FACE. DUSK                 The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a                 free hand.                 The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances,                 textures, colors -- anything at all. They can t see walls,                 ceiling, even a floor.                                       MCCONNELL                          Surface seems firm and level.                                       LUKE                          Roger that. Texture is smooth.                                       TERRI                          I ve got good footing and no                           obstructions. Let s check our --                 Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock                 sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of                 each other s hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they                 came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some                 sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.                                       TERRI                          It s solid again! We re trapped.                                       MCCONNELL                          Don t move! Keep this orientation.                 The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the                 brightness, some twenty feet apart.                                       MCCONNELL                               (keys his mike)                          Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK                 Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the                 main computer. It works! He s immensely relieved.                                       PHIL                          Computers are online! Ready to load                           software. But guys -- we re losing                           visibility here.                 He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then                 realizes that he s hearing only silence over his radio.                                       PHIL                          Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone                           there...?                 No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread.                                       PHIL                          Don t leave me.                 INT. FACE. DUSK                 McConnell is staring at his spacesuit s sleeve. He can see                 that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the                 shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke s greenhouse. He                 hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his                 right glove.                 Terri and Luke see this.                                       TERRI                               (alarmed)                          Jim, what re you doing? You ll                           depressurize!                                       MCCONNELL                          I don t think so.                 McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there s the                 hiss of rushing air.                                       LUKE                          Jim, seal it!                                       MCCONNELL                          No. That was air going into my suit,                           not out. Look at your own suits --                           they re not rigid anymore. We ve got                           pressure in here.                 Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell s right.                                       TERRI                          Above Mars atmospheric? That s                           impossible.                                       MCCONNELL                          We re millions of miles from Earth                           and we re inside a gigantic white                           face. What s impossible?                 Terri types on her arm keypad. She s amazed.                                       TERRI                          There s six psi in here...                               (taps more keys)                          Nitrogen and oxygen.                                       LUKE                          Otherwise known as air?                 Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring.                 Luke follows suit.                                       TERRI                          Hey, there may be some lethal trace                           gasses I haven t picked up yet, or...                           or... oh, the hell with it.                 Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all                 three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against                 their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air.                 And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed                 another kind of test...                 HIGH, STRIATED WALL                 Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled                 eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands,                 plates, ramps. It s part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height                 and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the                 hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach                 ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from                 within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.                 THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK                 Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end                 of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame                 A SHAPE MATERIALIZES                 And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form,                 which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign,                 wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the                 astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to                 say  Enter.  All her motions are both calm and calming --                 precise, unhurried, gracious.                 MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI                 Look at each other. They re awed into silence, and still                 tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than                 fear. Their eyes agree: Let s go.                 They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the                 ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian,                 who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and                 disappear inside.                 INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK                 Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open                 space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor,                 but without apparent walls.                 The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop,                 too, uncertain what they re meant to do. Then the Martian                 gestures again.                 A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the                 floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie                 lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...                 MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI                 Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this                 column, forming a loose triangle. As they stare into it, the                 myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their                 spacesuits.                 IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC COLUMN                 The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to                 them the story of ancient Mars:                 A BLUE PLANET                 we do not recognize. All is peaceful, beautiful.                 INTERCUT                                       MCCONNELL                               (softly)                          Is that what I think it is?                                       LUKE                          Yeah. It s Mars.                 SUDDENLY A HUGE ASTEROID                 Tumbles through space towards the planet...                                       TERRI                          Oh my God.                 ON THE PLANET - CLOSER VIEW                 As thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface,                 heading in a stream out of the solar system...                 THE ASTEROID IMPACTS                 And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. Oceans boil                 and vaporize. Two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the                 planet, spinning in flames...                 MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI                 Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...                 THE PLANET IS NOW DEAD                 As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. The                 flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.                 THE ASTRONAUTS                 Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.                 IN DEEP SPACE                 The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it                 continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system.                 Then we zero in on                 ONE PARTICULAR ROCKETSHIP                 As it peels off and goes in another direction. Graphics show                 a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix                 of DNA. The ship heads towards another blue planet in our                 solar system...                 EARTH                 As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the                 landforms all wedged together.                 TERRI                 Her voice is soft.                                       TERRI                          Earth, when it was still Pangaea.                           Before the continents separated.                 THE LONE MARTIAN SHIP                 Makes a fiery streak through Earth s atmosphere and plunges                 into the ocean.                 Instantly the image of the DNA double helix grows, filling                 the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and                 pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new                 images...                 MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI                 Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as                 LIVING FORMS                 Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing,                 crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms,                 plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs,                 birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning                 panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive                 sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck                 FACES OF THE ASTRONAUTS                 Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column                 dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric,                 colored rings on the floor. The astronauts are left staring                 at each other across the open space where the column had                 been.                 THE MARTIAN                 Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their                 circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite                 her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The                 Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands.                 As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into                 McConnell s eyes.                 MCCONNELL                 Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It s                 the first time we ve ever seen him utterly without sadness                 or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.                                       MCCONNELL                          They re us. We re them...                                       LUKE                          We re Martians...?                                       MCCONNELL                          That s what she means.                                       TERRI                          Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion.                 McConnell and Luke look at her.                                       TERRI                          Almost six hundred million years                           ago, there was a sudden expansion of                           life on Earth. The first multi-celled                           plants and animals appeared. No one                           has ever understood why...                                       LUKE                          They seeded Earth.                 We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and                 simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor                 begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.                 THE ASTRONAUTS                 Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the                 circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the                 outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally                 reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo                 blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter                 here, like stars against a midnight sky.                 THE MARTIAN                 Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in                 particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle                 of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.                 MCCONNELL                 Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first                 time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as                 abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.                 Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden,                 static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.                                       PHIL                               (over radio)                          ...in, please. Can you... me?                 Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.                                       TERRI                          Phil, we re here! We read you.                 Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the                 relief in Phil s voice. And then the desperation.                                       PHIL                          Thank God! Listen, this storm is                           really --                               (loud static)                          -- few more minutes, I can t --                               (more static)                          You ve gotta get back to the ship!                 And then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost.                                       TERRI                          Phil? Phil...?                 Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register,                 with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of                 the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as                 THE FIRST ORANGE BAND                 Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this                 new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri.                                       MCCONNELL                          We are in a ship. This is a ship.                           And the countdown has already started.                 Terri looks at Luke, alarmed.                                       LUKE                          He s right.                                       TERRI                          Then let s get the hell out of here!                 She scoops up Luke s helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches                 it, she s already starting back out, in the direction they                 came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware                 that McConnell isn t with them. They turn back. He s still                 rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of                 the colored rings.                                       LUKE                          Jim...                 McConnell doesn t turn.                                       LUKE                          Jim, we gotta go.                                       MCCONNELL                          I m not coming with you.                                       TERRI                               (stunned)                          What?                 Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.                                       TERRI                          What are you talking about? We ve                           got to get home.                                       MCCONNELL                          That s where I m going. Don t you                           see? That s what all this is for.                               (McConnell gestures                                at the ship around                                them)                          You were right Terri. This is an                           invitation. To follow them. To follow                           them home.                 He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this                 idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half                 smile.                                       MCCONNELL                          I have to go. This is the mission                           now. To find out who we are. Isn t                           that why we came here? Like Maggie                           said,  To stand on a new world and                           look beyond it to the next one.                  Luke nods at the memory of Maggie s words. Terri remembers                 too. McConnell s passionate conviction is affecting them                 both.                                       MCCONNELL                          You know, when you think about it --                           I wasn t even supposed to be here --                           all the accidents, everything that                           got us to this point, it s just...                           it s just... I just know it s right.                 Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.                                       MCCONNELL                          I m okay. I know what I m doing. But                           you re running out of time. You ve                           gotta get back to the ERV and get                           off this planet. Now please go.                 Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.                                       LUKE                          I once felt like I was taking your                           turn. But now I think maybe you re                           taking mine. Guess I m a little                           jealous.                 They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a                 lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.                                       LUKE                          Thanks for saving my life.                                       MCCONNELL                          My pleasure.                 Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet,                 as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken                 beat. Her eyes are glistening.                                       TERRI                          I wish Woody were here to see this.                           He would ve wanted to go too, Jim.                 Terri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She s                 going to be okay.                                       MCCONNELL                          He s here, Terri. We wouldn t have                           made it without him.                 Terri nods. She digs into one of her suit s pockets, pulls                 something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes                 around it.                                       TERRI                          Take care, Jim.                 McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns,                 picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused,                 looking back.                                       LUKE                          Hey, Jim...?                                       MCCONNELL                          Yeah?                                       LUKE                          Have a great ride.                                       MCCONNELL                          Always do.                 Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him,                 then hurry away, into the darkness.                 MCCONNELL                 Looks down at what Terri gave him.                 IT S WOODY S NECK CHAIN                 With the little Flash Gordon rocketship.                 MCCONNELL                 Grips this tightly as he looks up.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT                 The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri,                 helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of                 the dust storm is upon them. They can t see much more than a                 few meters.                 As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that                 the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They                 look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell                 is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike.                                       LUKE                          Phil? Phil, do you read?

Let s get the                           hell out of here!                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT                                       PHIL                          Is anyone there? Can anyone read me?                 Phil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He                 hesitates, then starts hitting some keys.                 CLOSE ON HIS COMPUTER DISPLAY                 Which reads:  PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST.                  INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT                 McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen                 tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing                 seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the                 indigo circle at their core. He looks at                 THE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR                 As it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous                 now, very deep and rapid.                 EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT                 The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards                 the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face                 behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying                 debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust                 chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they                 speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.                 INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT                 McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly                 A TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER                 Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up                 from the circumference of the indigo circle.                 Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops                 down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse                 in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as                 neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.                 MCCONNELL                 Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being                 imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he s virtually                 immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can t                 even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT                 Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping                 switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his                 DIGITAL CLOCK                 Which reads  1350.                  PHIL IS STRICKEN, TORMENTED                 His finger hovers over a  Fire  button. He licks his lips                 nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button.                 CLOSE ON COMPUTER DISPLAY                 And the words:  IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED                  INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT                 McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds                 him, when something catches his attention. He arches his                 neck, looking down.                 A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID                 Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some                 unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are                 covered.                 MCCONNELL S EYES                 Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder                 but                 HIS GLOVED HANDS                 Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.                 MCCONNELL                 Looks down again.                 THE COBALT LIQUID                 Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...                 MCCONNELL                 Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher,                 can he somehow climb to safety?                 ABOVE HIM                 The entire  ceiling  of the Face is becoming translucent. He                 can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising                 into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself.                 These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water                 snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a                 collision course.                 INT. ROVER. NIGHT                 Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri                 stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to                 be heard over the ROARING WIND.                                       TERRI                          I ve lost the Base Camp beacon!

I know Jim gave him                           a direct order, but he won t leave                           without us.                 EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT                 The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing                 it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It                 disappears from view!                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT                 Phil sits in the pilot s seat. He is looking at a computer                 graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With                 resignation, he keys his mike.                                       PHIL                          This is ERV, do you read? ERV to                           Rover, do you read...?                 Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red                 switch that reads  LAUNCH.  He hesitates, then actually has                 his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle                 of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike.                                       PHIL                          This is ERV, do you read?

Blinking back the tears, he tries                 to compose himself, then keys his mike.                                       PHIL                          Uh, Phil s not here right now. He                           left for Earth five minutes ago.                           Please leave your message at the                           beep.                 EXT. THE FACE. NIGHT                 FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising                 from the forehead of the Face, from its  third eye,  spinning                 and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex.                 But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew,                 this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks                 begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin,                 cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing                 uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face                 itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming                 vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds,                 causing a dark counter-swirl.                 EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT                 Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV s ladder, gripping it                 to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust.                 THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm                 seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out,                 struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands,                 helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused.                                       PHIL                          Where s Jim?                                       TERRI                          He got another ride.                 Phil stares at her, bewildered.                                       LUKE                          Tell you on the way. Let s go!

NIGHT                 LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue                 fluid has risen to McConnell s upper chest. Now it s at his                 shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring.                 He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep                 his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.                 He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing                 from side to side. Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth,                 his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!                 The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top                 of the cylinder.                 MCCONNELL                 Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much                 fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting                 for his inevitable death...                 EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT                 WIDEVIEW FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex bends from side to                 side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the                 Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical                 shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the                 Martian ship. It is a flattened convex circle whose matte-                metallic angles replicate the  Face  imagery.                 EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT. SIDEVIEW FROM INSIDE THE FACE                 As the Face burns away around us, the Martian ship begins to                 rise and spin.

As it                 draws more and more power from the disintegrating Face, the                 Martian ship in its center spins faster and faster.                 INT. MARTIAN SHIP. NIGHT                 MCCONNELL S FACE                 Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the                 huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We re reminded                 of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the                 same thing about to happen to McConnell?                 His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his                 lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it s being shaken                 from his lungs.

NIGHT                 As we MOVE IN CLOSER ON HIS FACE, we suddenly see, with him,                 a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE                 PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them                 as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view                 them from new and slightly different angles. These images                 INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell s pale, shaking, near-                death face in the present...

He turns to us, smiling joyfully. A blinding white                 flash, and he disappears...                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 THE TEENAGED MAGGIE                 Is on her porch, under a night sky, bending down to the                 eyepiece of a TELESCOPE. She looks up at us with a shy, proud                 smile.

A blinding white flash and they vanish...                 MAGGIE MCCONNELL                 In an astronaut s pressure suit, drifts rapidly towards us,                 reeling in along a tether. A man s gloved hand is                 outstretched, reaching for her. As she grips the hand, we                 see her triumphant expression through her faceplate. A                 blinding flash; she s gone...                 MCCONNELL S FACE - IN THE PRESENT                 Is shaking savagely; he is very near death. And then, all at                 once, the SHAKING STOPS.                 Time itself seems to stop.                 McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then,                 fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his                 mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe                 it.                 His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe                 it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes,                 the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully                 trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his                 eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...                 BRIDAL VEIL IS LIFTED                 And REVEALS, in CLOSEUP, the beautiful face, the shining                 eyes of MAGGIE McCONNELL. Beatific, eternal. She gazes                 directly INTO CAMERA, then smiles...                 MCCONNELL                 Smiles back.                 EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT                 WIDE VIEW, FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex changes from red-                orange to blue-white. It ROARS with terrifying power as its                 top starts to bend, angling like a telescope towards a                 specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a                 rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast,                 blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface,                 leaving only a blacked crater where the Face had been.                 EXT. MARS. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT                 ANGLE FROM DEEP SPACE, LOOKING DOWN, as the Martian ship,                 riding its blue-white column of energy, streaks up into the                 vast blackness, like a narrowly focused spotlight piercing                 the night. Down below, we can see the dust storm in all its                 vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet s                 surface, which it now completely covers.                 As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship,                 much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on                 a different trajectory. We recognize the familiar, comfortable                 sight of the ERV.                 PUSHING IN QUICKLY ON THIS.                 We see three figures in the cockpit.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT                 Luke, Terri and Phil are strapped in, with their acceleration                 just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit                 interior is starkly bathed in white light. They wince at the                 unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved                 hands.                                       TERRI                          Dear God. Look at that.                 Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship                 hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.                                       PHIL                          Is that him?                 Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke s voice is a                 whisper, both of prayer and farewell.                                       LUKE                          Godspeed Jim McConnell.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 OMITTED                 Sequence omitted from original script.                 EXT. SPACE                 Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship                 receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-                white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is                 a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless                 expanse of the star-filled heavens.
